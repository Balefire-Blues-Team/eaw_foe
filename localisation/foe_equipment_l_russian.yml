 raptor_equipment:0 "Raptor Cloudship"
 raptor_equipment_desc: "The Raptor-Class Cloudship was designed by the Ministry of Awesome during the Great War to provide ground support and deal with singular large aerial targets. This later purpose led to them being nicknamed 'dragon killers', as they gained a reputation for being used to counter Zebrican-aligned dragons. They achieve flight through cloud generators, which unfortunately leaves them vulnerable to weather related accidents."
 
 power_armor_equipment_x01: "X01 Power Armour"
 power_armor_equipment_x01_desc: "X01-Class power armour was designed towards the very end of the War by the Ministry of Awesome, in conjuction with the Ministry of Wartime Technology. Unlike the sleeker model designed prior with the aid of the Ministry of Image, the X01 model was designed with durability over mobility in mind. This made it unpopular among the pegasus soldiers. As a result, this armour wouldn't rise to popularity until the early days of the Enclave, when the greater protection it afforded became greatly desirable."
 
 power_armor_equipment_x02: "X02 Power Armour"
 power_armor_equipment_x02_desc: "The X02-Class power armour is far more closely related to the original pegasus power armour than the X01 model. As resources grew scarcer, the Enclave was forced to design a less resource-intensive armour. The end result was the X02 model, which was much sleeker and lighter than its predecessor."
