MAN_law_of_moon:0 "The Law Of The Moon"
MAN_law_of_moon_desc:0 "§RWhile this national spirit is active it will prevent [Root.GetName] from waging war against any other bat pony nation§!\n§W--------------§!\nThe death of the Equestrian Diarchy and by extension Princess Luna inevitably shook the faith of its bat pony citizens causing a variety of schisms and wars to break out in the Jungles of the South-East.\n\nThankfully cooler heads prevailed and the Law of the Moon was firmly reinstated after a year long Moonspeaker Conclave came together in Ayacachtli in 1054 to discuss matters of religious orthodoxy and proper worship.\n\nThis law prevents bat ponies from inflicting violence upon each other, participating in slavery, and engaging in marriage with non-bat ponies... While these laws are followed by more or less every bat pony tribe or nation in the South-East, certain groups have taken a much more lax and liberal approach to enforcing them in the past..."
MAN_gateway:0 "Gateway To The Jungle"
MAN_gateway_desc:0 "§WWhile this§! §Mnational spirit§! §Wis§! §Gactive§! §Wit§! §Wwill generate an additional§! £bottle_cap_display §G100§! §MCaps§! §Weach§! §YQuarter§!\n§W--------------§!\nThe Nuclear Apocalypse coupled with the myriad of insane tribals and raider gangs infesting the Baltish Coastline have made traversing the dense jungles of South-Eastern Equestria an arduous task at best, and a suicidal one at worst.\n\nSuch circumstances have forced any trader or caravaneer that may seek to acquire valuable South-Eastern goods such as sugar, chocolate or tobacco to use the Badlands route stretching between New Mango and the ancient city of Ayacachtli coincedentally this allows us to easily tax and control any trade passing through our fair town."
MAN_peculiar_institutions:0 "Peculiar Institutions"
MAN_peculiar_institutions_desc:0 "While ostensibly following the Law of the Moon, the citizens of New Mango and by extension the Three Clans that lead it have developed certain… peculiar institutions and concepts that have earned New Mango a reputation as a debauched hellhole.\n\nWhile in accordance to the Laws laid down in 1054 bat ponies are not allowed to engage in slavery, nor inflict harm upon one another, this does not mean that their non-bat pony underlings are not allowed to do so in their name. This loophole coupled with a general disinterest in caring about non-bat ponies present within the city has lead to the creation of a certain type of caste system upon which’s back the economy now sits."
