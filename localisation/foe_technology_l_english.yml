 talon_pa_tech:0 "Talon Power Armour"
 talon_pa_tech_desc:0 "Power armor based off of the old Ministry of Awesome designs, which has been adapted specifically for griffon use."
 
 raptor_tech:0 "Raptor Cloudship"
 raptor_tech_desc:0 "The Raptor-Class Cloudship was designed by the Ministry of Awesome during the Great War to provide ground support and deal with singular large aerial targets. This later purpose led to them being nicknamed 'dragon killers', as they gained a reputation for being used to counter Zebrican-aligned dragons. They achieve flight through cloud generators, which unfortunately leaves them vulnerable to weather related accidents."
 
 x01_pa_tech:0 "X01 Power Armour"
 x01_pa_tech_desc:0 "X01-Class power armour was designed towards the very end of the War by the Ministry of Awesome, in conjuction with the Ministry of Wartime Technology. Unlike the sleeker model designed prior with the aid of the Ministry of Image, the X01 model was designed with durability over mobility in mind. This made it unpopular among the pegasus soldiers. As a result, this armour wouldn't rise to popularity until the early days of the Enclave, when the greater protection it afforded became greatly desirable."
 
 x02_pa_tech:0 "X02 Power Armour"
 x02_pa_tech_desc:0 "The X02-Class power armour is far more closely related to the original pegasus power armour than the X01 model. As resources grew scarcer, the Enclave was forced to design a less resource-intensive armour. The end result was the X02 model, which was much sleeker and lighter than its predecessor."

 balloon_tech:0 "Ministry of Morale Balloon"
 balloon_tech_desc:0 "During the War, the Ministry of Morale designed hot air balloons that looked like Ministry Mare Pinkie Pie. These balloons were used for a large variety of purposes, from monitoring suspicious activity to transporting soldiers for a raid. Though their visage is more than a little unnerving, they allow us to both monitor our own skies and to perform aerial recon."

 ### Pony Techs
 TITLE_PONY_EP_SUBTITLE:0 "EARTH PONIES"

 tech_pony_foe_misc2:0 "Earth Pony Ingenuity"
 tech_pony_foe_misc2_desc:0 "Due to their inherent lack of magical manifestation, earth ponies have always had to push harder to innovate, especiallialy in the fields of arcane matrix technology such as robotics and computing."

 ###Expanded Industry Tech###
 
 extraction_industry_tech_4_2:0 "Soundwave Extraction"
 extraction_industry_tech_4_2_desc:0 "Utilizing ground sonar to locate deposits in order to scout out scavenging sites will speed up the process a lot. Additionally, dedicated sound bays are able to use super-low frequencies to pulverize certain materials, while leaving others unharmed, making extraction childs play."
 
 construction_industry_tech_4_2:0 "Glass and Steel"
 construction_industry_tech_4_2_desc:0 "While certainly not the most aesthetically pleasing, we have an abundance of steel, and glass is pretty simple to manufacture. Not being reliant on time-consuming bricks will certainly make construction easier, but this should only be a temporary solution until we come up with some less labour-intensive methods."
 
 habitation_industry_tech_4_2:0 "Military Construction"
 habitation_industry_tech_4_2_desc:0 "During the Great War, the Ministry of Wartime Technology worked in conjuction with the Ministry of Peace to design temporary housing complexes, which could be used to house soldier and civilian alike. While they were not the most comfortable of living spaces, the ease in which they could be built made them fulfill their purpose exceptionally well. We will study their methods and modify them to be of use in our own projects."
 
 maketool_engineering_7:0 "Arcano-Mechanical Tools"
 maketool_engineering_7_desc:0 "Powered tools are nice, but what about tools that do most of the work by themselves? These arcano-mechanical constructs dynamically adapt themselves to whatever situation they encounter, changing size, shape and hardness as needed. This advancement would allow a single universal tool to fulfill the tasks we'd need a dozen others for before."
 
 universal_industry_tech_cap:0 "Atomic Rearrangement Process"
 universal_industry_tech_cap_desc:0 "By using extremely advanced spell-matrices and ludicrous amounts of energy, we are able to literally rearrange objects on the atomic scale, transumuting base elements into one another like lesser civilizations thought impossible before. Truly this is the cutting edge of production technology."

 extraction_industry_tech_6:0 "Matrix Powered Alchemy"
 extraction_industry_tech_6_desc:0 "Utilizing the latest advances in spell-matrix research, we are able to pinpoint imperfections that arise as a result of our production and extraction processes. We may then use targeted alchemy to transmute the faults into usable material. No longer will a poorly forged piece of metal or a defunct circuitboard need to be thrown away!"

 construction_industry_tech_7:0 "Ether Materials"
 construction_industry_tech_7_desc:0 "Naturally, materials that are physically impossible in our world could theoretically be much more resilient and easier to work with than even our best composites. Using arcane reality-bending, combined with cutting-edge summoning spells, would allow us to literally pull such impossible materials from the Ether and into our world."

 agriculture_industry_tech_8:0 "Self-Improving Crops"
 agriculture_industry_tech_8_desc:0 "Through the miracles of unrestrained artificial intelligence, we believe it is entirely possible to create a crop that is both capable of adapting to any environment and fully self-improving. Some people express concerns regarding the potential dangers of such technology, but ending world hunger is more than worth the risk. After all, the odds of a 'crop singularity' occuring are extremely low."
