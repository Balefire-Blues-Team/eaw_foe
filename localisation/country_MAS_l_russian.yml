### FOCUS TREE ###
##################

### Remember: no "Stable".
### Remember: you are not forced to write giant texts for focuses. Mystery`s tree is more event-oriented. 
### Can`t say this for others, but for now we are not talking about them.

### Opening Focuses ###

MAS_Photo:0 "Stolen Photos"
MAS_Photo_desc:0 "A series of classified photographs taken by our recon teams have gone missing. Concerningly, these photos depict the Surface, which is far more habitable than our previous projections. If these were to fall into the wrong hooves, it could lead to widespread dissent and chaos across the entire Ministry!"

MAS_Chase:0 "A Suspicious Absence"
MAS_Chase_desc:0 "One of our scientists failed to report for work duty today, with no notice of absence provided. In light of recent events, this is considered highly suspicious. The Investigative Committee will be checking up on her."

MAS_Lockdown:0 "Lockdown Protocol"
MAS_Lockdown_desc:0 "We haven't heard back from our agent for a while, and many of our personnel are getting uneasy. To help preserve the stability of our Ministry, we shall implement full lockdown protocols. A full curfew will be enforced and no one will be allowed to leave their room without a security escort."

### ACT 1 ###

MAS_P2S:0 "First Steps Towards Order"
MAS_P2S_desc:0 "Action must be taken, lest our entire Ministry be consumed by the flames of chaos! Minister Horny shall gather those loyal to him, and prepare to act."

MAS_P2F1:0 "Chaos Rises!"
MAS_P2F1_desc:0 "The situation is only growing more dire. In order to restore order, we shall bolster both our security forces and our Investigative Committee. Ponies will think twice before protesting against our leadership if they know that they'll be beat down or dragged away in the night."

MAS_P2F2C1:0 "New Committee Offices"
MAS_P2F2C1_desc:0 "The Investigative Committee is being overwhelmed with the amount of work we've thrust upon them. To help them keep up with everything, we'll reallocate resources towards providing them with more workspace and personnel."

MAS_P2F2C2:0 "New Manufactory"
MAS_P2F2C2_desc:0 "Our security forces require more armaments. We'll reallocate our resources towards providing for them."

MAS_P2F3:0 "Volunteers"
MAS_P2F3_desc:0 "A number of volunteers that wouldn't usually be deemed fit for our security forces are asking to join. While we could always use more hooves, there are concerns regarding lowering our standards."

MAS_P2F4C1:0 "A Committee Dinner"
MAS_P2F4C1_desc:0 "The Investigative Committee is hosting a dinner soon. It is being hosted at the same time as the Security Department's own dinner. Which should our Minister attend?"

MAS_P2F4C2:0 "A Security Dinner"
MAS_P2F4C2_desc:0 "The Security Department is hosting a dinner soon. It is being hosted at the same time as the Investigative Committee's own dinner. Which should our Minister attend? "

MAS_P2F5C1:0 "Unacceptable Behavior"
MAS_P2F5C1_desc:0 "A budget meeting between the heads of each department came to an abrupt end recently, after Commander Iron and Chief Detective Cursed Soul, who was sent in the Director's stead, ended up in a hoof fight. Chief Detective Soul was injured during the affair, and the Investigative Committee is now demanding that Commander Iron be reprimanded and demoted. The Commander has countered this with a claim that the Chief Detective is at fault for this and is the one who should be demoted." 

MAS_P2F5C2:0 "Close Production"
MAS_P2F5C2_desc:0 "Director Night has raised concerns regarding our focus on armament production. She claims that focusing on civilian production would benefit us far more. This has of course led to a rise in tensions between the Investigative Committee and the Security Department."

MAS_P2F5C3:0 "Robot Question"
MAS_P2F5C3_desc:0 "Commander Iron has come to us with a plan to support the Security Department: He would like to repurpose our robots to support our security personnel. Director Night has spoken out against this, claiming that all of our robots are needed where they are right now."

MAS_P2F5C4:0 "The Servant System"
MAS_P2F5C4_desc:0 "Under the Servant System, as established in 1163, a large amount of our population  has been classified as servants. These servants are not afforded pony rights, and are considered little more than property to our Ministry."

MAS_P2F6C1:0 "Magic Competition"
MAS_P2F6C1_desc:0 "Director Night wishes to host a magical competition, in order to see who the strongest unicorns within our Ministry are. Should we send resources towards this project?"

MAS_P2F6C2:0 "War Games"
MAS_P2F6C2_desc:0 "Commander Iron wishes to host a series of war games between various departments, in order to help train our personnel to defend themselves. Should we send resources towards this project?"

MAS_P2F7C1:0 "Only the Best"
MAS_P2F7C1_desc:0 "The Investigative Committee has raised concerns regarding the quality of our security forces. They are calling for stricter standards to be enforced, requiring that all security personnel be required to meet higher magical standards."

MAS_P2F7C2:0 "Every Caster Counts"
MAS_P2F7C2_desc:0 "A spell is a spell, no matter whose horn it is from. In order to further bolster our security forces, Commander Iron is asking for approval to lower his departments standards."

MAS_P2F8:0 "Final Meeting"
MAS_P2F8_desc:0 "Minister Miracle has called all department heads to an emergency meeting. Let's see what he wants."

MAS_P2F9:0 "The Ministry is Safe"
MAS_P2F9_desc:0 "Our Ministry has been stabilized, and Minister Miracle's rule reaffirmed. The future is bright."


### Mystery Night ###
# From Mystery's person.

MAS_P3MS:0 "My Turn"
MAS_P3MS_desc:0 "I have done it. Minister Miracle has been displaced, and I am now the Sixth Minister."
MAS_P3M1C1:0 "A Miraculous Endorsement"
MAS_P3M1C1_desc:0 "Many within the Ministry still look up to and respect our former Minister. To help consolidate our rule, we shall have a small chat with him and set up a speech where he gives Minister Night his full and enthusiastic endorsement as his successor."
MAS_P3M1C2:0 "From Pens to Revolvers"
MAS_P3M1C2_desc:0 "We now have the entire Ministry at our command and no longer need to dedicate our precious ponies to simple administrative tasks. Our office personnel shall be sent to the field, where they shall better serve our interests."
MAS_P3M1C3:0 "Tying Up Loose Ends"
MAS_P3M1C3_desc:0 "Captain Tough Iron and his cronies are still an issue for us. In the interest of our Ministries stability, he must be dealt with. It's a shame how he died in that freak training accident."
MAS_P3M2C1:0 "Protecting Knowledge"
MAS_P3M2C1_desc:0 "We are the last bastion of Equestria, the last bastion of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences, and the last bastion of ponykind itself. We can not risk our own safety, for by doing so we would be risking the safety of ponykind as a whole. "



### Mystery Night military tree ###

MAS_ArmyOfDetectives:0 "Army of Detectives"
MAS_ArmyOfDetectives_desc:0 "We can not trust the Security Department to protect our Ministry. So, we shall ensure that our own detectives are spread throughout their ranks, overseeing all they do. While we're at it, we shall keep an eye on every other department."

MAS_IncreaceMilBudget:0 "Increase Security Budget"
MAS_IncreaceMilBudget_desc:0 "Drastic times require drastic measures, and our budget is no exception to this. If we are to ensure that the Security Department is capable of protecting us all, we must allocate more resources towards them."

MAS_FortificationsForAnyCase:0 "Fortify the Stable"
MAS_FortificationsForAnyCase_desc:0 "Our reserve equipment, our scientists, our laboratories, and so much more - it's all inside of Stable 49. If it falls, the Ministry falls. And even though our soldiers have the best equipment and training in the world, we should further fortify our entrance. Y'know, just in case."

MAS_ExpandTheStable:0 "Expand the Stable"
MAS_ExpandTheStable_desc:0 "We are limited largely by space. Expanding onto the Surface is out of the question, so we must instead begin expanding our facilities underground."

MAS_NewMachineries:0 "New Machinery"
MAS_NewMachineries_desc:0 "Our industrial machinery is outdated, most of it being as old as our stable itself. In the interest of improving both our civilian and security manufacturing, we should improve upon and upgrade our machinery."

MAS_ExpandTheArmyOfMages:0 "More Mages in Security"
MAS_ExpandTheArmyOfMages_desc:0 "The protection of Ministry assets should be our first and foremost concern. We shall transfer some of our more skilled mages from other departments over to security. Not only shall this ensure the height of magical talent within our security forces, but it will also further shake the grip that the late Tough Iron's supporters have over the department."

MAS_MoreCarefulLook:0 "Conscripting Talented Servants"
MAS_MoreCarefulLook_desc:0 "Not all of our servants are useless when it comes to magic. A number of them can even pass our Security Departments standards. Though this speaks poorly of said standards, it does mean we could offer these servants a position within their department."

MAS_FillOurStockpiles:0 "A Successful Recall"
MAS_FillOurStockpiles_desc:0 "Our R&D Department has recently been working on creating a teleportation-based recall spell, allowing us to essentially summon any ponies or objects from one location to our own. Though most of their experiments have ended in failure, the latest one has been a massive success. An attempt to "recall" items from an old military facility listed in our records has resulted in quite a large stash of wartime weaponry. Unfortunately, we doubt they could repeat this success."

MAS_BuildAASystem:0 "Build An Anti-Air System"
MAS_BuildAASystem_desc:0 "We're not sure when, or how, but the Director of Manufacturing and the Director of Logistics apparently worked together for once and created a fully functional anti-air flak cannon, that can be raised to the Surface through a silo door. While this is an impressive feat of engineering, we can't help but ask...why?"

MAS_BetterTacticsBetterSolutions:0 "Better Tactics, Better Solutions"
MAS_BetterTacticsBetterSolutions_desc:0 "We need two things: good officers and a good strategy. And while our security officers are the best we know of, our strategy leaves a lot to be desired. If we just get encircled by barbaric tribals and destroyed at first contact, we are just wasting lives. But if we improve our tactics, we can be the ones to encircle."

MAS_PreventForeignResearch:0 "Protecting Our Communications"
MAS_PreventForeignResearch_desc:0 "Having a good idea is all well and good, but if someone steals it, it's not only useless, but it can also be turned against us. And with all those robots out there, it wouldn't be the first time an inventor gets killed by his own invention."

MAS_IndustryIsNessesary:0 "Industry is Necessary"
MAS_IndustryIsNessesary_desc:0 "We need even more industry if we are to fully and properly supply our security officers. More resources shall be allocated towards expanding our production capabilities, so as to ensure that every officer gets a rifle."

MAS_ImproveOurSkills:0 "Improve Our Skills"
MAS_ImproveOurSkills_desc:0 "Our officers are undoubtedly the best of the best - however, our strategy still isn't. Putting a battalion of the best officers in the world under the command of a group of discordant supervisors is like giving a sharpshooter with Parkinson's a laser rifle with night vision and- you get the point, we should fix this."

MAS_AgentsAreWatching:0 "We Are Watching"
MAS_AgentsAreWatching_desc:0 "We see all, hear all, and know all. Nobody can hide from the eyes of the Ministry."

MAS_ContinueOurTrainings:0 "Continue Our Training"
MAS_ContinueOurTrainings_desc:0 "Guns are all well and good to have, but if you don't know how to use them, you can charge at your enemy with sticks and stones too. And as sad as this fact may be, too many of our officers are facing it. This can not be."

MAS_PreparedAndReady:0 "Prepared and Ready"
MAS_PreparedAndReady_desc:0 "We have invested a lot of time and resources, but now it finally pays off. Our Security Department is now larger, stronger, and more modern than ever before, and we are now prepared for any threat the Surface may throw at us."

#### Tough ####

MAS_P3TS:0 "Why we still here?"
shareMAS_P3T1:0 "Just to suffer?"
MAS_P3T2C1:0 "Every night, I can feel my leg..."
MAS_P3T2C2:0 "and my arm..."
MAS_P3T2C3:0 "even my fingers."
MAS_P3T3C1:0 "The body I've lost..."
MAS_P3T3C2:0 "the comrades I've lost..."
MAS_P3T3C3:0 "won't stop hurting..." 
MAS_P3T4:0 "It's like they're all still there."
MAS_P3T5:0 "You feel it too, don't you?"

#### HORNY ####

MAS_P3HS:0 "Back to Work"
MAS_P3HS_desc:0 "Now that our Ministry has been reunified, we can turn our attention to dealing with the problems outside of our walls. The Surface awaits."

MAS_P3H1:0 "The Legitimate Successors"
MAS_P3H1_desc:0 "Equestria did not die with the world. It lived on, in the form of its most talented and faithful Ministry. It is our duty as the last remnant of the Equestrian government to rebuild the world in our image."

MAS_P3H2:0 "To Reclaim the World"
MAS_P3H2_desc:0 "We have found about what we expected out here. Primitive tribes, simpleminded raiders, and nonpony creatures infest these once prosperous lands. We will see to it that they are all dealt with."

MAS_P3H3:0 "The Lightning Ultimatum"
MAS_P3H3_desc:0 "Our scouts have returned from the east. They speak of a bunch of primitives calling themselves 'The Lightning Scavengers'. Though they might be a simpler people, they may still be civilized enough to recognize their saviors. We shall give them a chance to peacefully submit to our rule, for their own good."

MAS_P3H4C1:0 "Enough Raiders!"
MAS_P3H4C1_desc:0 "Raiders are the worst scum of post-war Equestria. Wiping them out is critical to ensure the stability and security of this region, beginning with the filth occupying the plains to the east."

MAS_P3H4C2:0 "Secure The River"
MAS_P3H4C2_desc:0 "(NEEDS NEW LOC)Despite the fears of some of our personnel, we haven't been immediately devoured by the terrors of the Surface. Indeed, we are actually doing quite well for ourselves. Using this fact, Minister Miracle shall rally more support for his expansionist efforts."

MAS_P3H4C3:0 "Deal With Featherbrush"
MAS_P3H4C3_desc:0 "To the north, a bunch of rightful Equestrian land is occupied by disgusting barbaric rude-mannered birds. They dare claim the land to be their own. Haven't they gotten the memo? Creatures don't get to own property."

MAS_P3H5:0 "The Appleloosan Deal"
MAS_P3H5_desc:0 "The wise ponies of Old Appleloosa seem to be lacking in technological edge, but what they do have is a lot of "servants". It seems they utilize a system similar to our own. Perhaps we could work out a mutually beneficial agreement?"

MAS_P3H6C1:0 "Resettlement Initiative"
MAS_P3H6C1_desc:0 "Now that our most immediate threats have been dealt with, we are now free to begin the process of sending our superior Ministry ponies to properly rule over and develop our new land. While out there, they may also see to managing the inferior Wastelanders that we have saved."

MAS_P3H6C2:0 "Restore Order"
MAS_P3H6C2_desc:0 "The situation is growing worse every day. Servants escaping, overseers being bribed, and our transports being sabotaged are merely the beginning. Luckily, our great Minister is already taking the necessary steps to ensure the stability of our ever growing Ministry."

MAS_P3H6C3:0 "Reassign Personnel"
MAS_P3H6C3_desc:0 "More land means more forces needed for its security. Our recruitment efforts need to be increased if we are to keep a strong grip on the newly acquired regions. After all, what use is the Office of Archives if our Ministry falls to barbarians?"

MAS_P3H7:0 "Dealing With Dissent"
MAS_P3H7_desc:0 "Those overgrown chickens are at it again! Taking advantage of our current crisis, a gang of griffons has started a revolt in what used to be their stronghold. We must send our forces in there to keep the peace and make sure that this attempted revolution does not spread!"

MAS_P3H8:0 "The Department of Slave Affairs"
MAS_P3H8_desc:0 "With the troubles on our homefront over, we may now turn our attention to the large slave population we now seem to have. In order to better organize and manage them, we shall create a proper department within our Ministry who is entirely dedicated to just that purpose."

MAS_P3H9C1:0 "A Question of Standards"
MAS_P3H9C1_desc:0 "Thanks to the recent developments, it might be wise to think how we should proceed with our army. Our great Minister Horny has full control of the composition of our troops, leaving the answer up to him: Shall our troops consist of only the best magicians, or shall we sacrifice their prowess in favour of more diversified and flexible forces?"

MAS_P3H9C2:0 "Free the Superior"
MAS_P3H9C2_desc:0 "Our nation has grown considerably. So much, in fact, that we no longer need to rely on our servants for menial tasks. It is time that we declare our unicorn bretheren to be redeemed of the crimes of their forefahters. From this day onward, all unicorns within our great Ministry shall be considered free ponies, as such is their right by birth."

MAS_P3H9C3:0 "Industrial Expansion"
MAS_P3H9C3_desc:0 "As the Ministries territory grows, so too do the needs of its citizens. If we are to keep the unicorns of our nation happy and our forces ready, we need to substantially expand our industrial capacities."

MAS_P3HF:0 "Form A Proper Government"
MAS_P3HF_desc:0 "Most ponies of our glorious Ministry would be pretty happy with what we have achieved so far. The tribes we have taken under our flag and the raiders we have pacified are already great monuments to the superiority of our civilization. However, one pony does not wish to rest here; one pony has a dream to create an even grander society..."

### PRE-UNICORNIA ###
### The Tinker Line###

MAS_P4PUS:0 "Dream"
MAS_P4PUS_desc:0 "Horny Miracle may not have even imagined to stand where he does right now, but he was always ambitious; always a dreamer. In his mind, the Ministry was fit for the role of the guardian of the new world order, a new Equestria, stronger than ever before under the rule of unicorns. And now, his dream can become a reality."
MAS_P4PU1:0 "Steel Hoof of the Ministry"
MAS_P4PU1_desc:0 "The Dream of Unicornia will come to reality soon enough! But before that happens, we need to prepare. As unreal as it sounds, modern wars cannot be won by ponypower and magic alone. Our army needs a symbol of strength through steel, a mighty machine that would dominate the battlefield. Our army needs a tank, or rather - many, many tanks."
MAS_P4PU2C1:0 "A Grand Parade"
MAS_P4PU2C1_desc:0 "With the plans for further conquest laid before our eyes, we know what we have to do. We are strong thanks to our unity and magic, and we will show it. Our citizens need to know the grandiose of the Ministry!"
MAS_P4PU2C2:0 "Medical Investments"
MAS_P4PU2C2_desc:0 "A long road is ahead of our troops, and the dangers of the wastes are ever present. It is inevitable that we will suffer casualties. Thus, it is our duty and responsibility to treat our forces as efficiently as possible when the time comes."
MAS_P4PU2C3:0 "Magical Weaponry" 
MAS_P4PU2C3_desc:0 "The old Equestrian designs for firearms may have been genuinely innovative and interesting, but they all lack a magical touch. We shall fix this at once; after all, our soldiers should not be forced to use outdated, outclassed weaponry when we could harness the power of magic to improve ALL our guns!"
MAS_P4PU3:0 "The Monster of Maripony"
MAS_P4PU3_desc:0 "Our ancestors made a mistake that cost us the loss of brightest, most intelligent minds of the time. The abomination that rose from their corpses, as well as its servants, alicorns, have defiled these lands long enough. It is time that we took responsibility for what we have created, and got rid of it for good."
MAS_P4PU4:0 "The Southern Republicans"
MAS_P4PU4_desc:0 "Vast lands of the central Equestrian Wasteland are still filled with raider scum and the industrial monstrosity of Fillydelphia slavers. If we are to conquer these lands and liberate the unicorns from their oppressors, we will need an ally... for now, at least."
MAS_P4PU4A1:0 "The Other Ministry"
MAS_P4PU4A1_desc:0 "Red Eye hasn't secured all of Fillydelphia. On the edges of his city, the so-called 'Steel Rangers' work against him, getting into skirmishes with his slavers and raiding his supply lines. To our great interest, these power armored ruffians also claim to be descended from the Ministry of Wartime Technology. We're both heirs to the Equestrian government, we share a common enemy, and we're both technologically superior to much of the Wasteland. Perhaps an alliance is in order?"
MAS_P4PU4A2:0 "The Slaver King"
MAS_P4PU4A2_desc:0 "Fillydelphia, the industrial hub of wartime Equestria. Today, it remains the industrial hub of the Wasteland as a whole. Countless slaves labor and die under a smog-filled sky, all thanks to one stallion who seeks to restore Equestria. Red Eye is brutal, charming, and idealistic. In other words, a stallion after Horny's own heart. Though many within our Ministry believe we must prepare for an eventual conflict with him, there's no reason we can't instead work with him to defeat our mutual foes."
MAS_P4PU5C1:0 "Forward to Victory"
MAS_P4PU5C1_desc:0 "The time has come. Our armies are ready for our command. They are all eager to begin the restoration of the glory of Equestria in its new form. Our enemies shall know the might of our Ministry!"
MAS_P4PU5C2:0 "Laying the Groundwork"
MAS_P4PU5C2_desc:0 "War is merely a means to an end for the visionaries of the world. Minister Horny knows that even with their victory, Unicornia will need more than military power to rise to glory. Preparations need to be made to ensure the prosperity of all unicorns in our new, glorious nation."
MAS_P4PU6:0 "Evacuation"
MAS_P4PU6_desc:0 "The capital of Unicornia was always meant to be in Canterlot. However, the transition will need time and resources, as well as ponypower... and sacrifices. With our lands secure, moving all of our personnel to the first evacuation point is now not only possible, but necessary."
MAS_P4PU7:0 "Canterlot Will Be Mine!"
MAS_P4PU7_desc:0 "\"With every passing day, I am getting closer to reaching Canterlot. Each day, the blood of the finest of unicorns is being spilt over my dream. Mark my words, citizens: the day when our Ministry will raise its flag over Canterlot's marble walls is near!\""
MAS_P4PU8C1:0 "The Next Point"
MAS_P4PU8C1_desc:0 "The evacuation shall progress further. Yet even though we control that region, there are still desperate leftovers of our enemies as well as wild animals that may destroy what we have worked so hard for. We will need to delegate a number of our troops to secure the foothold and defend our citizens from the dangers of the wastes, along with to escort our ponies northwards."
MAS_P4PU8C2:0 "My Glorious City!"
MAS_P4PU8C2_desc:0 "If Canterlot is supposed to be our capitol, we cannot let it stay in ruins. Our servants shall restore the city to its former, pre-war glory using the toil of their hooves under the direction of our citizens. The world shall once again see the splendour that emanated from its white marble walls and tall towers!"
MAS_P4PU9:0 "The Final Stop"
MAS_P4PU9_desc:0 "The hour of our victory is near, and Canterlot will be ours soon. The third phase of our evacuation shall proceed now. Our scientists will be unable to work properly, and our citizens will need even more protection than ever. However, those hardships will all be worth it once we finally gain control of the capitol. For Unicornia!"
MAS_P4PUF:0 "A Dream Realized"
MAS_P4PUF_desc:0 "It is done. Canterlot is, at last, under our control. Its beautiful streets can once again be walked by our citizens, the beautiful icon of majesty that is the palace has opened its doors once more. At last, one ambitious pony's dream has become reality."

###So Ends the Tinker Line###

###Unicornia-Tree###

MAS_Unicornia_begins:0 "Unicornia Begins"
MAS_Unicornia_begins_desc:0 "The dream was achieved, and yet it's just the beginning. With Canterlot under Horny's control, it is now time to bring splendor to this new, glorious empire, to raise it above all the squabbling 'nations' of the wastes."

MAS_Unicornia_our_prince:0 "Our Prince"
MAS_Unicornia_our_prince_desc:0 "Minister Horny is a title of old, one that belongs to the times when we were in search of the Dream; the times when our home was a metal-cased prison under the ground. A unicorn seated in the marble walls of Canterlot Palace deserves a much more grandiose title for what he has accomplished. Truly, we cannot see our glorious leader as anything but royalty!"

MAS_Unicornia_call_unicorns:0 "Call Upon All Unicorns"
MAS_Unicornia_call_unicorns_desc:0 "Hear us, noble unicorns of the wasteland, for Unicornia calls you! It is time for you to leave your hardships and struggles behind. No longer shall you be forced to fight for survival; No longer will you have to live in muddy shacks, eat wild, mutated fruits and meat of the dirty mongrels, and kill your companions... for Unicornia will keep you safe, fed, and comfortable!"

MAS_Unicornia_royal_guard:0 "Found a New Royal Guard"
MAS_Unicornia_royal_guard_desc:0 "The Royal Palace is simply not the same without the Royal Guard protecting it. They were once a symbol of might and security in the capital, and they shall serve that function in Unicornia as well. And while their presence adds legitimacy to the Prince's rule, they also add a degree of protection to our leader."

MAS_Unicornia_protect_domain:0 "Protect Our Domain"
MAS_Unicornia_protect_domain_desc:0 "Even though we got rid of many threats in the wastes, even more are ready to come knocking upon our doors. Creatures of the caverns, wild animals and beasts, stray raiders - they all may try to cause chaos among us. We must ensure our readiness to meet those challenges head-on."

MAS_Unicornia_holy_kingdom:0 "Splitting Open the Skies"
MAS_Unicornia_holy_kingdom_desc:0 "The skies of the Equestrian Wasteland were draped in an eternal layer of clouds, dooming its denizens to a life without a sight of the glorious sun. With magic at our disposal, we could tear a hole in the sky, retaking what the ponies of the surface had to live without. And what better place to do that than above our capital? Canterlot will bask in the glow of warm sunshine once more!"

MAS_Unicornia_beauty_of_home:0 "The Beauty of Our Home"
MAS_Unicornia_beauty_of_home_desc:0 "In the distant past, the streets of Canterlot and its surroundings caused awe and respect among its visitors. Those tall, white buildings with their spire-like roofs dominated the skyline. Noble ponies lived here; just like us, they could appreciate the beauty of their home. Even though that beauty is now hidden among the rubble, among cracked walls and crumbled ceilings, we will make sure to restore the Capital back to its glory."

MAS_Unicornia_trains:0 "Restore the Canterlot Railways"
MAS_Unicornia_trains_desc:0 "Pre-war Equestria managed to maximize the benefits of its infrastructure, the basis of which they created long before the Great War. Canterlot Station was the centre of transit in these parts of Equestria - if there was a railway in an area of 500 miles away from the capital, it was connected to that station. Rebuilding the entire network would take ages; however, restoring the most important part, the Canterlot Station and its sister station in Glyphmark, would be a good start."

MAS_Unicornia_industry_kind:0 "The Industry of Our Kind"
MAS_Unicornia_industry_kind_desc:0 "Little speaks of the might of the Equestrian nation more than its industry. In a span of just a couple of years, Equestria managed to completely overhaul its production capabilities by building huge factories and tall machines, employing thousands of ponies and even creating artificial intelligence and robots. Their industry provided the tools necessary for magical technology to progress. Restoring that capability will be a great stepping stone to the greatness of Unicornia."

MAS_Unicornia_R_and_D:0 "Unicornian R&D"
MAS_Unicornia_R_and_D_desc:0 "Our research and development teams may not have had the best conditions to perform research when we were moving our capital, but nothing stops them from resuming work now that we are here. Given some time and effort, we could restore a big part of our research capabilities and bring our scientists up to speed again. With luck, they may even be inspired by the much more spectacular views from the palace, compared to the dull Ministry walls."

MAS_Unicornia_brave_army:0 "Found the New Unicornian Army"
MAS_Unicornia_brave_army_desc:0 "As wonderful it would be to keep our current army structure, the Unicornian army requires a number of necessary changes if we are to maintain dominance in the fight against both inside and outside threats. Throughout history, even nations smaller than us could not rely solely on their best units. From now on, the brightest among our unicorns will need to lead by example as their less magically talented peers follow their orders. New training routines will be implemented; A recruitment campaign shall take place. The New Unicornian Army will shine as a bright example of efficiency and might!"

MAS_Unicornia_seize_STA:0 "Crack Open the Stable"
MAS_Unicornia_seize_STA_desc:0 "A nearby stable, one where the famed Stable Dweller came from, is somehow still standing despite the rapid changes in the outside world. Its denizens will very likely not welcome us with open hooves, and yet the technologies and secrets kept within its walls could help in our effort to create a strong Unicorn nation. Besides… There are still unicorns who did not get a chance to live with us. It is obvious that we need to get inside that stable and use its wonders to aid our growth."

MAS_Unicornia_into_canter_mountains:0 "Drive the Dogs From the Mountains"
MAS_Unicornia_into_canter_mountains_desc:0 "The mountains to the east of Canterlot were, for a long time, considered uninhabitable. Then, those filthy canines proved us wrong, digging tunnels and threatening our security. We must get rid of the hellhounds in this region, once and for all; Only then will our citizens be safe."

MAS_Unicornia_unite_the_holy_lands:0 "Unite the Lands of Canterlot"
MAS_Unicornia_unite_the_holy_lands_desc:0 "Canterlot and its surrounding lands are finally under our complete control. Hellhounds have been exterminated, the raiders - chased away and defeated. The riches of Stable 2 are being used to aid the Unicornian cause. At last, we may proceed to settle in these lands without a worry."

MAS_Unicornia_unicorns_rule:0 "Rulers of the New World"
MAS_Unicornia_unicorns_rule_desc:0 "With our control asserted, we proved once more the superiority of the unicorn race. Neither the earth ponies, nor the pegasi could achieve what we could; starting from the walls of our Ministry we climbed our way up, time and time again proving that nothing could stop the mighty unicorns. Let the world know its masters!"

MAS_Unicornia_racial_conclusion:0 "A Solution to the Racial problem"
MAS_Unicornia_racial_conclusion_desc:0 "So far, our resolutions regarding servitude have been unclear at best, and confusing at worst. What began as a system to punish criminals and political dissidents within the ministry has eventually grown and mutated over time to the system we have now, and that system still has a couple of points that need to be precisely taken care of. Prince Horny plans on settling this matter once and for all. One thing is certain, however: all unicorns are equal in their supremacy over the rest of ponykind, and may never be enslaved again."

MAS_Unicornia_old_friends:0 "Our 'Old Friends'"
MAS_Unicornia_old_friends_desc:0 "Recently, we have come to realise that a secret society, similar to what we once were, exists. They have been hiding in the beautiful jewel of Manehattan, the Tenpony Tower, for years. What is nowadays called 'The Twilight Society' is, by all means, a descendant of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. While it is true that we were separated for a long time, perhaps it is a good idea to make contact with them once more."

MAS_Unicornia_axis_expansion:0 "Expanding the Summerdale Axis"
MAS_Unicornia_axis_expansion_desc:0 "Our friends and vassals have grown in number considerably since we left the walls of our Ministry. What started as a small alliance eventually became Unicornia with its satellite states. The Twilight Society also seems to follow our principles. It is clear that we need to invite them to join us in our efforts to create a better place for all magically talented ponies to live."

MAS_Unicornia_past_heroes_desc:0 "History is often shaped by famous figures, their significant deeds and inspiring words. There is, of course, nothing wrong with taking an example from great ponies of the past, heroes whose fame gave birth to tales of great valor. A good enough hero can cause all the difference in how one nation's forces approach an incoming battle."

MAS_Unicornia_tanks_tanks_tanks:0 "Our Famous Tanks"
MAS_Unicornia_tanks_tanks_tanks_desc:0 "Tanks have proven to be an indispensable asset in the hooves of the Ministry army. Their mighty hull provided security, firepower, and morale to the troops during our campaign to reclaim Canterlot. Even still, they were not perfect. Now that we have reached our goal, we have had enough time to understand the flaws in their design - and to come up with a solution to make them better than ever before!"

MAS_Unicornia_military_academy:0 "Canterlot Military Academy"
MAS_Unicornia_military_academy_desc:0 "Our armies may be strong, and our leaders - competent, but we are still limited by the technology of our time. Founding the Canterlot Military Academy would provide our brightest minds with the resources and conditions to come up with new, refreshing solutions, whilst also serving as our primary warfare research centre. After all, the wasteland is still a dangerous, unkind place; it is best to be prepared for what it might throw at us."

MAS_Unicornia_restore_canterlot_ships_desc:0 "During wartime, Canterlot was a powerhouse of military industry. The capital provided weapons, vehicles, arcane tech and others to almost all fronts during the Great War. It is very unfortunate that the destruction of the city did not spare those factories; however, provided we spend enough resources on recovering them, we could use Equestria's most modern facilities for our own goals."

MAS_Unicornia_aeroplanes:0 "Unicornian Aeroplanes"
MAS_Unicornia_aeroplanes_desc:0 "Times change. What was once strictly a pegasus ability - soaring high in the skies - was spread to the rest of ponykind during the war, thanks to enormous, powerful machines made of lightweight metal. They often turned the tide of the battle. If we are to dominate our foes, we must learn how to construct and operate aeroplanes as well as pre-war engineers and pilot aces, respectively."

MAS_Unicornia_airships:0 "Fortresses of the Skies"
MAS_Unicornia_airships_desc:0 "Aeroplanes were not the only kind of tech that allowed ponies to fly above the clouds. The massive, heavily armored 'sky fortresses' were designed by Pegasi, but history mentions them being operated by ground-bound crews. It is enough proof for us that we, too, can learn how to construct and use them to our advantage."

MAS_Unicornia_protect_city:0 "Protecting the City From Above"
MAS_Unicornia_protect_city_desc:0 "Canterlot is difficult to reach from the ground level due to its location on the side of a tall mountain; however, said location makes it incredibly easy to target from the air. During the war, the city could be protected by the Alicorns with their magical shield. Attempting to cast such a spell now would not only tax most of our unicorns' power, but it would also require a vast amount of energy, making that solution very impractical. Luckily, there are more... 'conventional' ways to protect ourselves from an airborne aggressor."

MAS_Mystery_Night_adv:0 "Mystery Night"

MAS_MagicBlossom_adv:0 "Magic Blossom"
MAS_MagicBlossom_adv_desc:0 "If one were to ask for information on Magic Blossom, answers would vary wildly. His name doesn't appear in the Office of Archive's records, and very few could claim to have known him growing up. Some theorize that he was made in a lab, while others propose him to be the lost third son of Minister Spark. Whatever the case may be, his devotion to Minister Miracle is well known and feared."

MAS_BravePaper_adv:0 "Brave Paper"
MAS_BravePaper_adv_desc:0 "Brave Paper is the Director of Archives. She sees to it that every document is properly filed and preserved, for the sake of future generations. Beyond that, she enjoys long walks in the greenhouses and writing romantic fiction of the other directors."

MAS_MetallWall_adv_desc:0 "Metal Wall is the brother of Industrial Way, though he would aggressively deny that if anyone asked him. He is one of the Directors of Manufacturing and Logistics.

MAS_BloodyStorm_adv:0 "Bloody Storm"
MAS_BloodyStorm_adv_desc:0 "Bloody Storm. This name inspires terror in even the strongest of servants. Being the Director of Pony Resources, he oversees all servant affairs. His methods are often brutal, and he has gained a reputation for being highly sadistic."

MAS_TrueWord_adv:0 "True Word"
MAS_TrueWord_adv_desc:0 "True Word is an honest stallion. Perhaps excessively so, as if anyone asks him what he knows about medicine, he will very honestly answer with 'absolutely nothing'.

MAS_IndustrialWay_adv:0 "Industrial Way"
MAS_IndustrialWay_adv_desc:0 "Industrial Way is the sister of Metal Wall, though she would aggressively deny that if anyone asked her. She is one of the Directors of Logistics and Manufacturing. She puts a strong emphasis on civilian manufacturing, much to the ire of the Security Department."

### EVENTS ###

#Feel free to add any event if after consulting about it with Genri(Minister).

masevent.100.t:0 "Stolen Photo"
masevent.100.d:0 "For the past 200 years, the Ministry has been operating under the assumption that little was left of the Surface, save for radioactive ruins and mutated monstrosities from beyond pony imagination. This has heavily influenced the perception of those within our ranks, and has gone a long way towards maintaining stability. However, a recent recon mission to the Surface discovered that our projections were entirely off. Not only were radiation suits unnecessary for their mission, but they actually found relatively unmutated plant-life, and signs of animal life. This has the potential to shake our Ministry to it's very core if it were to get out. As a result, the entire recon team has been sworn to secrecy and placed under constant surveillance, and the photographs taken have been locked into the Minister's safe. \n \n Late last night, the Minister's office was broken into. His safe was broken into, with the only thing taken being the photos depicting the Surface. We could quickly have a crisis on our hooves if they got out to the public! "
masevent.100.a:0 "We must find it."

masevent.101.t:0 "The Chase Begins"
masevent.101.d:0 "Within the Ministry, every pony is expected to do their part. Failing to report for work duty is a serious offence, one that can carry a hefty punishment if no valid reason can be provided for the absence. So when one of our scientists, Dr. Marigold Miracle, failed to report for her shift, we were quick to send an Investigative Committee detective to her residence. However, upon arriving, he found Dr. Miracle hastily packing her saddlebags. Before he could confront her, she grabbed her bags and teleported away."
masevent.101.a:0 "Search the room!"

masevent.1011.t:0 "Searching For Evidence"
masevent.1011.d:0 "Our top detective, Magic Blossom, has been put on this case. Arriving at the scene, he immediately went to work searching the entire dwelling. From the wardrobe to the bathroom cabinet, no stone was left unturned. The onlooking security personnel were impressed by the speed at which he went through the entire residence, searching the entire place top to bottom within a mere 10 minutes. At the end of it, he emerged with a single piece of evidence: one of the stolen Surface photos, presumably left behind due to Dr. Miracle's haste. With this, we have a culprit for the crime, and a possible idea of where she went."
masevent.1011.a:0 "Magic Blossom did his job well."

masevent.1012.t:0 "Blossom's Bizarre Adventure"
masevent.1012.d:0 "Blossom's first few steps out into the Surface were met with a tremble in the ground, as a giant mutated scorpion came charging out from behind a rock at him. The abomination before him was no match for his might though, and he quickly dispatched it. Following this bit of excitement, he immediately set out into the Wastes. \n \n It would be over two months before he finally came across a settlement with a solid lead. In the time before finding it, he had joined a local Chapter of the Steel Rangers, explored the city of the dead, killed a gang leader, and blown up a military base home to an army of mutants that sought to march upon the entire Wasteland. \n \n Walking among the town, he couldn't help but think about how it was the most disgusting thing he had ever seen. Scrap shacks, occupied by pathetic filth-coated creatures in the shell of ponies. Coming across what appeared to be an establishment of intoxication, he spoke to the authoritative stallion standing behind the bar. He couldn't tell if the stallion's natural fur color was a dark brown, or if he was just that filthy. Managing to suppress a sneer was perhaps the hardest thing he had ever done, as he showed the dirty rag before him a picture of Dr. Miracle. \n \n Surprisingly, the walking bag of dirt actually proved himself useful. He identified her as ‘Señorita Marigold', a stranger that had come into the town recently. Finally, after his long journey, he had found his target. \n \n Entering a small shack that he was told she resided in, Blossom prepared to put an end to this..."
masevent.1012.a:0 "She gets the drop on him."
masevent.1012.b:0 "She's completely unprepared."

masevent.102.t:0 "Interdepartmental Tensions"
masevent.102.d:0 "Our Ministry is entering the worst crisis it has faced under Minister Miracle's rule. Instability is growing rapidly, as many discontent personnel and servants begin to mumble their dissent. In order to prevent this from escalating into a widespread protest against his rule, the Minister has begun to take extensive measures. The Investigative Committee has taken to keeping a very close eye on everypony, with them constantly dragging ponies away in the night. Meanwhile, the Security Department has more than tripled its patrols, helping disuade any potential troublemakers.\n\n Unfortunately, this has led to another issue. Our Investigative Committee and Security Department personnel are being put under quite a lot of stress right now, which has led to them taking it out on eachother. Fights are breaking out between their personnel rather commonly now, with this rivalry even being present among the highest ranks of each department.\n\n To make matters even worse, Commander Tough Iron and Director Mystery Night have begun to clash on a variety of political issues. While the good Commander believes we should emerge to the Surface and begin to claim our rightful place in the world, Director Night instead calls for us to further isolate ourselves from the outside world.\n\n  We'll have to be careful in how we deal with them, lest we tear our Ministry apart."
masevent.102.a:0 "I'm surrounded by idiots."

masevent.1021.t:0 "The Issue of Blessed Touch"
masevent.1021.d:0 "Minister Miracle's brother, Blessed Touch, has always been a figure of some concern. Being the Director of Interdepartmental Affairs has allowed him to cement himself has a popular figure among many of our higher ups, making him practically untouchable. Before this crisis, Detective Magic Blossom was trusted with keeping a close eye on him. Unfortunately, Detective Blossom is now gone, and all Investigative Committee detectives are already being overworked trying to keep order within the Ministry as a whole. This has allowed Blessed Touch to go for long periods of time without any sort of supervision, which could give him time to plan and plot against our Minister."
masevent.1021.a:0 "Concerning."

masevent.110.t:0 "The Lockdown"
masevent.110.d:0 "The situation has steadily grown worse within our Ministry. As more ponies begin to doubt Minister Miracle, he has begun to escalate the measures being taken to maintain order. Everyone is now under constant watch, and not one pony is to step a single hoof outside of their quarters without an escort. These increasingly invasive measures have resulted in even more fear and doubt among our personnel, making this perhaps counterproductive. However, as this is all going on, another issue still persists: Detective Blossom still hasn't returned from his mission. This has left Minister Miracle very concerned, and he has begun to consider sending another detective out into the Wasteland to check up on him. Director Night has argued against this however, calling it a waste of an detective and reassuring the Minister that Detective Blossom is perfectly capable of taking care of himself."
masevent.110.a:0 "Send a detective out to him!"
masevent.110.b:0 "No, he will be just fine."

masevent.1101.t:0 "Blossom's Unceremonial Return"

masevent.1101.d0:0 "Magic Blossom was resting in an old abandoned shack when Detective Shine came across him. Surprised to see another Investigative Committee member out here, he was quick to begin asking about what had happened back home. He was quickly filled in, being informed about the crisis back in the Ministry and the instability it is currently facing. In light of this, Blossom was very quick to take off back towards his home, constantly teleporting to speed up his journey. \n\n Upon his arrival back at the Stable, he was faced with a locked door. The door control didn't respond to the passcode, and his attempts to communicate over the intercom were met with silence.

masevent.1101.d1:0 "Magic Blossom has finally returned home from his mission. However, rather than being met with a welcoming committee, he was instead met with a locked stable door. His passcode wasn't working and his attempts to communicate over the intercom were met with silence. Fearing the worst, he proceeded to bypass the Stable door entirely through teleportation, and was immediately met with..."
masevent.1101.a:0 "...an Investigative Committee detective."
masevent.1101.b:0 "...an empty entry hall."
masevent.1101.c:0 "...an activated security turret."

masevent.11011.t:0 "Accident"
masevent.11011.d1:0 "Upon entering the Stable, Blossom was immediately met by a hailstorm of bullets from a security turret. Being unprepared, he quickly went down. His body would be found a hour later, with the cause of death being chalked up to a turret malfunction. Minister Horny was of course devastated, and he has called for a full investigation into this occurence. Director Night has promised that no resource will be spared finding the one responsible and bringing them to justice. Commander Iron, on the other hoof, has stated that this was a simple accident and that no one is responsible. He has strongly advised against wasting any resources on an investigation, but has promised his support should one occur."
masevent.11011.d2:0 "Upon entering the Stable, Blossom was immediately met by an empty hallway. However, as he proceeded towards the Stable attrium, an automated turret began to open fire upon him. He was quick to throw up a magic shield, saving his life. Following this occurence, he was quick to make his way to Minister Miracle's office, while remaining cautious of any more attempts on his life. Rushing past the Minister's guards, despite their protests, he burst into Horny's office and was met with the stallion himself.\n\n He was quick to give his report, informing the Minister of his success. However, the apparent attempt on his life was also noted, and a Horny was left furious that such a thing could happen under his nose. He granted Detective Blossom some time to rest, and called an emergency meeting to discuss an investigation into this occurence."
masevent.11011.a:0 "An investigation is unnecessary."
masevent.11011.b:0 "An investigation will be conducted at once!"

masevent.151.t:0 "Volunteers"
masevent.151.d:0 "Our Security Department enjoys a variety of luxuries and benefits that are the envy of many within the other departments of our Ministry. This has led to a large number of personnel that wish to transfer over to this favored department. However, most of them do not meet our standards. Normally, this would simply result in them being rejected and nothing more happening. However, Commander Tough Iron has requested that Minister Miracle grant an exception to all but the most incapable of these volunteers, letting most of them become security officers.\n\n Many within our Ministry have voiced their displeasure regarding this idea. Unsurprisingly, Mystery Night has become the new ringleader for this opposition. According to her and those aligned with her, this would be spitting upon the prestiege of our Ministry itself. Minister Miracle is now forced to make a decision regarding Iron's request, as waiting any longer may cause the shouting matches at our meetings to escalate further."
masevent.151.a:0 "If they meet Commander Iron's standards, I hardly see a problem."
masevent.151.b:0 "We can not compromise on quality. No exceptions shall be granted."

masevent.1521.t:0 "A Polite Evening"
masevent.1521.d:0 "Stepping into the Investigative Committee's newly constructed dining hall, Minister Miracle was met with a series of reserved greetings from various high-ranking officials. After taking his seat at the head of the table, Minister Miracle continued engaging in small talk while waiting for the food to be served to those present.\n\n In between chatting about friviulous nonsense with one detective and another, the Minister sipped his glass of wine and scanned the rest of the table. Most of the officials present were busy engaging in pleasantries, not even noticing the Horny's gaze. The exception to this was Director Mystery Night herself, who was similarly scanning the room. After a brief moment of eye contact, the director stood up and clinked her silverware against her glass, catching everypony's attention.\n\n 'Hello. I would like to take a moment to thank you all for attending tonight's dinner. This event may let us get to know eachother better and bring us all closer together. I would also like to take a moment to thank Minister Miracle for his attendance. We are truly honored to have him here, sharing in our meal.'\n\n All eyes fell on the Minister, who briefly coughed before giving a statement to the awaiting table.\n\n 'Thank you, Director Night. It is my honor to be here tonight, eating alongside those who work so hard to keep our beloved Ministry safe. Thank you all for your service.'\n\n Satisfied, Mystery Night gave a final thank you to the Minister before sitting down as plates of fried asparagus were brought out to the table."
masevent.1521.a:0 "A pleasant dinner."

masevent.1522.t:0 "An Enjoyable Evening"
masevent.1522.d:0 "Stepping into the repurposed Security Department Recreational Lounge, Minister Miracle was met with the sight he had not been expected. Rather than a neat orderly crowd, the assembled figures before him were all in the midst of what seemed to be a very energetic party. The smell of whiskey was in the air, and several high ranking personnel were recounting various tales of excitement and action to their equally intoxicated coworkers. Horny hadn't even finished taking it all in before Commander Tough Iron was at his side, escorting him further into the room.\n\n 'I'm glad to see you could make it. We were beginning to worry you had gotten lost!' With a laugh at his own joke, the Commander led Horny to a pair of seats in the center of the room. Before sitting down, he threw his hoof up and waved one of the many servants in the room towards the pair. 'So, I know you don't drink anywhere near enough nowadays my friend. Why don't you relax tonight and enjoy a drink or three?'\n\n A mug full of a rich brown liquor was placed before him, and at Iron's insistence, the Minister began to indulge in drink. From there, the night quickly became a blur, as all concerns were thrown to the wind. Come morning, the Minister would wake up in his bathroom with a pounding headache and a dozen complaints regarding the various crimes Iron and he committed last night."
masevent.1522.a:0 "It was a hell of a night."

masevent.153.t:0 "The Budgetary Conflict"
masevent.153.d:0 "Discretely sipping from his flask, Chief Detective Cursed Soul looked around at the various flank kissers at the table with him. He wished he were anywhere but here, and knew that he would be staring at the revolver in his desk drawer for a long while tonight. He was here now though, and there was little to do but to try to make it through it without his flask running dry. Of course, this was becoming increasingly difficult as the imbeciles around him all called for their own departments to get a budget increase, at the expense of all others. As Commander Iron stood up, Cursed braced himself for the headache that he knew would follow.\n\n 'You are all completely idiotic. The most important department of this Ministry is the Security Department. If not for us, you would all be at the mercy of those barbarians who infest the Surface above! Therefore, it is only right that we be given a higher budget, as we are far more important than most of you.'\n\n As Iron had started his tirade, Cursed had just felt a tinge of annoyance. Now, that annoyance was quickly turning in contempt towards the fool of a stallion. Before his reasoning could stop him, he stood up and responded to the Commander.\n\n 'I fear that you are the only true idiot here. Your inane babbling has been torture to us all, and that giant blimp you call your ego has unfortunately led to you refusing to grant us anything that even remotely resembles an intelligent comment. Your flimsy excuse for a department is hardly any more important than any other, and I dare say that giving you fools an even higher budget would be a grave diasaster for us all.' \n\n The Commander stared at him for a moment, mouth idiotically agape. Then his hoof came flying across the table, with his entire body following.\n\n Following this event and Cursed Soul's hospitalization, Minister Miracle has been forced to decide on who to reprimand for this. Whoever it is will obviously not be happy, but doing nothing is unfortunately not an option, as that would make things escalate even further."
masevent.153.a:0 "Cursed Soul is at fault."
masevent.153.b:0 "Tough Iron is to blame."

masevent.1531.t:0 "Tough Iron doesn't like it and revolts."

masevent.1531.a:0 "Prepare a firing squad."

masevent.154.t:0 "A Matter of Production"
masevent.154.d:0 "Horny Miracle often thinks back on better days, desprately wishing he were once again simply the Commander of Security, rather than the Minister of everything. Back then, he had to deal with far less petty politics, and his life was much simpler. Nowadays, he's lucky to get through the day without a pounding headache, and a concerningly increasing amount of grey hairs are appearing among his once beautiful blonde mane.\n\n The Minister is brought back to reality by a heated argument between the two usual suspects: Director Night and Commander Iron. Tuning in, it quickly becomes evident that today's debate is over whether or not we should reallocate our industry towards providing for our civilian personnel. As the argument continues to escalate, Horny knows he has little choice but to intervene with a definite stance."
masevent.154.a:0 "Focus more on civilian production."
masevent.154.b:0 "Our industry is fine as is. Why are you two even fighting over this?"

masevent.155.t:0 "A Matter of Automation"
masevent.155.d:0 "To help free up ponies for other roles, our production centers are greatly automated. Robotic workers and machines are the very backbone of our industry. This has apparently been the source of an idea from Commander Iron: supplement our security forces with repurposed robots. He believes this to be a brilliant way to expand our forces beyond what our low ponypower would otherwise allow, but Director Mystery Night has called this one of the most incompetent plans she possibly could imagine. According to her, our robots are where they are for a reason, and removing them from their current roles would be a disaster. The final choice now falls to Minister Miracle, who desprately wishes anypony else could deal with making this decision for him."
masevent.155.a:0 "Flesh is weak, iron prevails!"
masevent.155.b:0 "Our robots shall stay where they are."

masevent.156.t:0 "The Servant System"
masevent.156.d:0 "Tonight's meeting turned to an important matter: the Servant System. Established by Horny's father, Minister Spark, the System served as a punishment to those involved in the Great Strike, along with their descendants. The servant's are considered to be below our personnel, and are granted no luxuries or benefits. Their entire purpose is to serve, providing menial labor and test subjects for the Ministry. Over time, this system has been expanded to also include undesirables, incapables, and political rivals. This has allowed us to sustain a large population of these servants, who have increasingly become critical to our continued development.\n\n Much to Horny's shock, this conversation remained civil and polite. Mystery Night simply called for us to keep a closer eye on the servants, which Tough Iron fully agreed with before stating that we should increase patrols in their residential areas. Could this really be it? The fabled topic that those two can finally agree upon?"
masevent.156.a:0 "It's like a Hearth's Warming miracle!"

masevent.157.t:0 "The Magic Competition"
masevent.157.d:0 "The best unicorns from all across our Ministry came together today to perform fantastic feats of arcane talent. Many personnel showed great promise, pulling off complex and powerful spells that awed the crowd. From young Junior Archivist Fresh Shine, who managed to turn an apple into an orange, to Security Officer Blue Say, who invented a shock enchantment for his handcuffs that only requires being recasted once a month. All sorts of talent was on display for us today. Unfortunately, some attempts were much less successful.\n\n Director White Coat, of the Research and Development Department, had to be severely reprimanded after his attempts to bring the skeletal remains of Minister Curd back to life. This resulted in [REDACTED]. The lowest levels of the Ministry are expected to be off-limits for the forseeable future, and all personnel in that section are considered deceased.\n\n All in all though, this was an enjoyable and productive event. Many of the newly invented spells or improvements upon old spells are already being catalogued and their usefulness evaluated for widespread casting. The Investigative Committee and Security Department also used this oppertunity to scout out promising casters to join their ranks."
masevent.157.a:0 "That was a swell time."

masevent.158.t:0 "Interdepartmental War Games"
masevent.158.d:0 "The War Games were a great success! Each department was organized into teams of 30 volunteer personnel each, with every team being led by their respective departmental head. The exception to this was the Security Department, who would simply be overseeing the event. These teams were then issued paintball guns, with the standard rules of being out if you get hit.\n\n The Research and Development Department was out within the first five minutes, to everyone's surprise. It seems they attempted to quickly enhance their paintball guns with a series of experimental enchantments designed to make their paintballs explosive and fast-firing. Unfortunately for them, this seems to have blown up in their faces. Literally.\n\n Director Storm led Pony Resources on a blitz through much of the Ministry, defeating both the Medical and Arcane Technology departments with brutal efficiency. Their reign of terror would only come to an end upon getting trapped in the middle of the Department of Logistics and Manufacturing personnel, who had formed two factions and turned on eachother. They were quick to put an end to this obstacle before defeating eachother.\n\n The Investigative Committee took heavy casualties in their conflict with the Office of Interdepartmental Affairs, but Mystery Night herself putting an end to the only other pony left standing: Brave Paper, the director of the Office of Archives, who she found hiding in a broom closet."
masevent.158.a:0 "That was fun."

masevent.159.t:0 "An Interrupted Dinner"
masevent.159.d:0 "Sitting down to enjoy a nice meal, Minister Miracle reflects on all the recent occurences within his Ministry. The escalated tensions have been nothing but problematic, and everything has been greatly stressful. He hoped it would be over soon though, and that things could finally start to get back to normal.\n\n As he bit into his apple fritter, Horny heard a firm knocking at his door. Who would interrupt him during one of these few moments of peace and quiet that he's afforded? Opening the door, he was met with..."
masevent.159.a:0 "It's just his secretary."
masevent.159.b:0 "The barrel of a gun, held by an Investigative Committee detective."
masevent.159.c:0 "Tough Iron, surrounded by his security officers."

masevent.160.t:0 "The New Minister"
masevent.160.d:0 "Sitting at her new desk, Minister Night smiled as she read through the various reports coming in from the rest of the Ministry. The transition of power was going very smoothly, much more so than she could of hoped. News of former Minister Miracle's house arrest had already made the rounds, and his most fanatical supporters had already outed themselves when they attempted to 'liberate' their beloved leader. They never saw the detective ambush coming until it was far too late.\n\n Tough Iron had already voiced his opposition to what he calls 'a clear overthrow of our legitimate Minister'. Of course, his voice means very little, as we have already arrested or coerced most of his cronies. Those who would oppose us have already been removed from their posts, and it wouldn't be long now before Minister Night's rule was absolute. And with that, the Ministry will finally be safe. Not just from threats outside of the Stable walls, but also from threats within."
masevent.160.a:0 "Our future will be secure."

masevent.205.t:0 "Horny Imprisoned"
masevent.205.d:0 "It was decided that in order to prevent riots from the imprisonment of former Minister Horny he would be placed on a permanent house arrest with detectives constantly watching his every move, in order to ensure that he does not escape or cause any trouble. He was obviously very resistant against this and it took a number of guards to subdue him. In the ruckus the guards yelled; "welcome to ‘horny' jail" among other obscenities. Eventually he complied but as time went on he continued to make several attempts at escape, all ending in failure. After a while he gave up on his attempts and is now always seen in a depressive state, but at least he won't cause trouble to anyone anymore."
masevent.205.a:0 "Now it is safer."

masevent.040.t:0 "A Message From Beneath"
masevent.040.d:0 "[LIT.GetLeader] woke up to a very strange messenger this day. The door to his office opened quietly, and the head of his advisor peeked inside with a worried expression, mentioning the arrival of a nicely dressed unicorn with an almost comically serious expression on his face. Curiosity and worry were the two major reasons why the messenger was allowed to step inside.\n\n The newcomer introduced himself as a member of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences, a \"nation\" situated in one of Stable-Tec's infamous pre-war bomb shelters. His suit seemed improperly well maintained and even ironed, which was only accentuated by the more practical, yet uglier outfits; similarly, the mane and tail of the stallion were much cleaner than living in the wastes would allow for. Upon an inquiry of what their business is, the unicorn had this to say:\n\n \"We, the Ministry of Arcane Sciences, represented by the Great Minister Horny Miracle, hereby call upon the leader of Lightning Scavengers. We come with a proposition, the outcome of which will decide whether you will keep your lives and territory safe... or not. Yield your land and resources for the sake of restoring the glory of the Equestrian nation under a new, unicorn-led banner. In return, we shall become allies with mutually agreed borders, and we shall lead you into the bright future that is a unified unicorn nation.\"\n\n [LIT.GetLeader] looked to the other officials in the room, unsure if what he had just heard was real. So far all they heard about this supposed Ministry was mere rumours, and now they come out with such an outrageous proposal? On the other hoof, who knows how powerful they are... They do claim to have superior technology and lots of magic users in their ranks. Perhaps it will be safer to just accept their conditions and see where it goes?"
masevent.040.a:0 "Who knows what they're capable of? Accept." 
masevent.040.b:0 "Who do they think they are? Shoot their messenger."

masevent.300.t:0 "Customers From the North"
masevent.300.d:0 "We've been hearing unusual tales from up north as of late. Stories of strange ponies, dressed as if they were from before the Great War itself, carrying otherwordly weapons that give of a mystical glow. Though we wrote most of this off as dash-fueled illusions, it seems there was some truth to it after all. Some fellows have come down to us looking for more slaves. Though their manners were very lacking, and their noses were upturned to us the whole time they've been here, a customer is still a customer. However, they are lacking in bottlecaps and have instead given us an unusual offer: their technology and expertise, in exchange for our slaves. Should we accept such an offer?"
masevent.300.a:0 "Yes, let's sell to them."
masevent.300.b:0 "No, I don't like their attitude."

masevent.301.t:0 "Incompetent Slavers"
masevent.301.d:0 "Though we have benefitted greatly from our expansion, it has unfortunately come with a severe downside; namely, that our slave population is far larger than our non-slave population. Indeed, we have so many that a large amount of them have just been kept in pens, awaiting work orders that will take a long while to come. It seems that they've been busy during this down time, as we are now seeing widespread rebellions against our rule. Nothing too severe yet, but we could be in real trouble if we don't get this situation under control."
masevent.301.a:0 "Shit."

masevent.302.t:0 "The Talon Uprising"
masevent.302.d:0 "The remnants of Featherbrush's Talons proved themselves to be very useful and adaptable slaves. Their natural flight abilities and claws made them very ideal for a variety of tasks that earth ponies are largely unsuited for. However, this has come back to bite us in the flank. The former Talons banded together and staged a massive revolt against us, seizing weapons from their guards and killing their supervisors.\n\n Of course, their little uprising was doomed to fail from the start. Reinforcements were quick to arrive, and after a brief shootout, managed to get the oversized chickens back under control. Needless to say, Minister Miracle was absolutely furious upon learning about this act of defiance. So furious that he mandated all griffons to be immediately executed, stating that they are such an inferior race that they don't even deserve life."
masevent.302.a:0 "We're glad that crisis was contained."

masevent.303.t:0 "No more servants."
masevent.303.d:0 "A report came from Horny's advisors a couple of days ago. Many of them contained a bunch of relatively useful information, but almost all of them also agreed on one, particular thing: the servant trade is growing rapidly. While the Ministry still had a lot of lowly, laborious work positions to fill in, it soon became obvious that lesser ponies could perform these tasks without as much of a strain to their unicorn masters. Given these circumstances, it soon gave birth to a new law, written and signed by Minister Horny himself.\n\n According to the newly signed document, all menial tasks, hard physical labour and other kinds of 'dirty' work were to be performed solely by earth ponies. Unicorns were permitted to help their less gifted pony brethren only if they proclaimed to do so on their free will; they could also expect a returned favour or aid in the future from the hornless creatures. Written as an addendum to the new law came another, widely supported clause: From now on moving forwards, members of the unicorn race could not, under any circumstances, get enslaved and forced into physical labour, no matter their crimes.\n\n The law's official, public inauguration was met with loud cheering from the crowd, consisting primarily of unicorns."
masevent.303.a:0 "A truly glorious day for all unicorns!"

masevent.304.t:0 "One Unicorn's dream..."
masevent.304.d:0 "Legends of the days gone say that, during their sleep, ponies of Equestria would have their dreams protected by none other than Princess Luna herself. She would watch over them, protect them from nightmares and ensure a good rest.  \n\n Minister Horny was sitting at the edge of his bed, staring into the dim light of his night lamp. The time was 3:30 am. Throughout the ministry, the lights were all dimmed to encourage its denizens to sleep soundly in order to perform the next day's duties full of energy. Most citizens of the Ministry were following the suggestion and were lying in their beds, with their minds lazily creating vidily unreal images. But not Minister Horny. The leader of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences, son of the most brilliant prime ministers of the last century, Horny Miracle reminisced of the days past. \n \n \"Of course, now we cannot treat it as anything but a myth. Princess Luna died in the siege of Canterlot during the war with the Zebras, you see,\" the unicorn spoke again, this time taking his eyes off the weak light and glancing to his side. There, lying under the cover of a soft, blue blanket, laid mister Dirty. \n \n Nopony knew a lot about mister Dirty. Few know of his existence, even fewer have seen him; his name escapes ponies' lips only during gossip and malicious slander. Despite that, he seems to know everything about the ministry's lives, and he is more than eager to tell Horny about it all... especially about what his pesky little brother is doing. \n \n Most curious of all, though, was the fact that mister Dirty was a simple rag doll, complete with two buttons as his eyes, representing a poor earth pony. \n \n Horny Miracle smiled to himself, speaking as he got up and slowly paced around the room. \"Nowadays, ponies do not have anyone to watch over their dreams. No one could guide them through the vast, mystic plains of the dreamwalkers, and no one could protect them from one of the accursed nightmares.\" The stallion stopped, looking straight into mister Dirty's button eyes. \"I, however, have been lucky. I was granted a dream nopony in the Ministry, nopony _in the equestrian wasteland_ could ever receive. A dream of restoration of a once beautiful country, with its denizes walking free, enjoying their life to the fullest while nature obeyed their wishes.\" \n \n Horny Miracle approached the doll again, sparks of excitement gleaming in his eyes while he spoke. \"A nation of old, reborn! Just imagine, mister Dirty, how beautiful it would be to see the wasted grounds above once more spring with life! A nation... ruled by the superior unicorn race.\"
masevent.304.a:0 "What a nice dream... wait, what?"

masevent.305.t:0 "...becoming something more."
masevent.305.d:0 "\"Yes, mister Dirty. I dream of something far, far greater than Equestria of old.\" Horny Miracle kept his voice quiet as he spoke, though it must have been difficult to keep his excitement down. For the first time, he shared his glorious vision with someone else. \"The old nation was strong in many aspects, but it lacked in others,\" the prime minister kept talking to his only, though very active, listener. \"Its powerful industry, brilliant research, and strong military were all signs of a great nation, ruled by the Goddesses in their wisdom. Seemingly, everything was going well for the ponies... and yet, the nation has perished. Swallowed by the ever growing balefire, smoldered to ash; all that's left of this once gorgeous nation is a barren wasteland.\" The unicorn made a small pause, looking straight at his personal assistant. His eyes no longer had the excited spark from before; instead, they were dull and seemingly empty, as if from sadness. \"You must know, my precious mister Dirty, that Equestria was not the first nation to be proclaimed in the lands above our Ministry. Once upon a time, further back than any all of our books could mention, there were three tribes of ponies: the earth ones, the pegasi, and the unicorns. Respectively, they all created their own kingdoms. The earth ones created the Kingdom of Earth; The winged ones created what they called Pegasopolis... while our own ancestors created what they once proclaimed as Unicornia.\" \n \n \"The tribes were all specialised in something. The earth ones could cultivate the earth, harvest its fruit, and build stable shelters. The pegasi were skilled warriors and protected their own ponies fiercely; the unicorns used their magic to create beautiful constructs, bring the elements under their control, and organise everything thanks to their superior intellect.\" Minister Horny finally smiled again, approaching his companion and sitting next to him. \"The tribes were weak on their own. It was the unicorns that came out with a proposition of a pact when a particularly dark and powerful winter swept through their lands. Under the direction of our ancestors, the tribes slowly transformed into what we now know as Equestria. The inferior races snuck their way into the leadership positions throughout the history, their weak minds breaking our glorious Pony nation from within.\" The minister decided it was time to lie down again. He shifted on his bed, covered himself with a blanket, and turned to face the rag doll again. It looked back at him with an empty stare. Minister Horny smiled. \n \n \"I shall return the glory of the old, and I shall make sure that neither earth ponies, nor pegasi will have any chance to interrupt me. Nopony else can know about our plans; not yet. When we are done with our preparations, I shall once again proclaim the nation of Unicornia..."
masevent.305.a:0 "\"And nopony in the wasteland will be able to stop me!\""

masevent.306.t:0 "A Peculiar Offer"
masevent.306.d:0 "An envoy from northeastern neighbour arrived in [NCR.GetLeader]'s office today. In it, there is a mention of a growing nation, aspiring to liberate the Equestrian Wasteland from the vile grip of raiders. Curiously enough, the nation seems to be consisted mostly of unicorn citizens; other kinds of ponies are treated worse, and some even compare their treatment to that of a slave.\n\n The representative of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences, as they claim to be, expressed deep hope of our country's signing of a non-aggression treaty. They are also certain that mutual trade and even a military alliance could benefit both nations tremendously. In return for our agreement, their government also promises to give away their stable once their goal is achieved. \n \n While their practices of this 'servant' system does bring their intentions to question, their ultimate goal seems noble, and the reward they promise - tempting. The question lies in whether these unicorns are trustworthy enough."
masevent.306.a:0 "Accept the offer."

masevent.3062.t:0 "The NCR Declines"
masevent.3062.d:0 "In an unfortunate turn of events, the NCR Officials have declined our offer of mutual aid and the pact of non-aggression. Minister Horny has expressed his disappointment over the decision, though he remains confident of the Ministry’s capability to fulfill their task on its own."

masevent.3101.d:0 "One of our scouts returned from their mission to Fillydelphia’s sprawling, industrial nation. Bringing good news, they mentioned the earth pony’s eagerness to accept our offer. Our nations are now stronger together."
masevent.3101.a:0 "Seems like this dirt pony is quite smart after all!"

masevent.3102.t:0 "Fillydelphia Declines"
masevent.3102.d:0 "A messenger came back from Fillydelphia today. Unfortunately, they did not agree to our terms and sent the diplomat away with empty hooves. At least they had the courtesy not to enslave him..."
masevent.3102.a:0 "Shame."

masevent.354.t:0 "The Ministry of Arcane Sciences Returns"
masevent.354.d:0 "An interesting proposition came from a nation calling themselves the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. These unicorns have promised to share their technology and access to their stable in exchange for a military alliance in an upcoming campaign to restore Equestria. While our scouts did mention a group of unicorn supremacists rising in power recently, we did not consider them to be in any way impactful to our goals; now that they have come out with this proposition, it may be worth considering to give them a chance. After all, a working stable and new technology is something our regiment can always use."
masevent.354.a:0 "Maybe it’s worth letting them prove their good intentions?"
masevent.354.b:0 "We should not risk it."

masevent.3091.t:0 "The Steel Rangers Accept"
masevent.3091.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, Fillydelphia Steel Rangers have accepted our terms of a military alliance. Now we have a powerful ally in our quest to reach Canterlot, even if they are not yet aware of what we are planning for the old Capital just yet."
masevent.3091.a:0 "Splendid."

masevent.3092.t:0 "The Steel Rangers Decline"
masevent.3092.d:0 "Our messenger to Fillydelphia Steel Ranger contingent came back empty-hooved. It turns out that these technology snobs are not willing to bring back safety and prosperity to Equestria after all."
masevent.3092.a:0 "What a shame..."


masevent.311.t:0 "The Formation of Unicornia"
masevent.311.d:0 "From the restored Canterlot palace, our brave and fearless leader Horny Miracle has made a monumental announcement: from this day forth, the Ministry of Arcane Sciences is no more. In its place is the newly formed nation of Unicornia, rightful successor to Equestria and inheritor of the Platnium Crown. Prince Horny Miracle himself shall lead us forward into a new bright age, one that is full of prosperity and peace. Our Ministry's various departments are already being restructured and turned into departments of our government in general."
masevent.311.a:0 "Long live Prince Horny. Long live Unicornia!"

masevent.312.t:0 "To Fly Too Close"
masevent.312.d:0 "Prince Miracle has promised us much more than just wealth; he has promised us the sun itself. With the use of our most powerful mages and our most talented researchers, we have devised a spell so potent and powerful so as to be a megaspell in it's own right. This spell, dubbed 'The Lightbringer', requires a dozen powerful unicorns to cast. The result of it is a great malstorm of wind that is capable of shredding the cloud layer above into nothing but shreds, giving our ponies the gift of sunlight.\n\n Unfortunately, it seems we have made some powerful enemies from this. A city of the so-called 'Grand Pegasus Enclave' has taken notice of our efforts, and have retaliated by both a constant bombing campaign against us and constantly patching up the clouds above. We shall not let ourselves be intimidated though. No matter how many times they blockout the sun, we shall persist in restoring it. Even if we have to cast our spell daily, which we unfortunately must."
masevent.312.a:0 "Sunlight is our birthright!"

masevent.313.t:0 "Unicornia is Offering an Alliance"
masevent.313.d:0 "An envoy has arrived in our tower, claiming to be from the nation of 'Unicornia' to the far west. It seems they believe that we share a common heritage with them, claiming that we both descend from the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. As a result, they firmly believe that we should seek an alliance with one another, in the interest of pursuing the Ministry's objectives. Though these bunch are certainly...eccentric, having new allies may not be a bad idea."
masevent.313.a:0 "Why not? Accept."
masevent.313.b:0 "We'd rather not."

masevent.314.t:0 "Tenpony Accepted"
masevent.314.d:0 "Tenpony has accepted our offer of an alliance. We shall move forward into the future, together!"
masevent.314.a:0 "Excellent."

masevent.315.t:0 "Tenpony Declined"
masevent.315.d:0 "Tenpony has regretably refused our generous offer of an alliance. This is nothing short of a grave insult against us and our ponies, but there's not much we can do about it currently."
masevent.315.a:0 "Very unfortunate."

masevent.316.t:0 "Our Brothers in Manehatten"
masevent.316.d:0 "Far to the east, within the ruins of the once-great city of Manehatten, there lies a tower largely untouched by the horrors of the apocalypse. Suspiciously enough, this tower is also the former Hub of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. It didn't take much investigating from there to reach the conclusion that they are descended from a splinter of our very own Ministry.\n\n Due to our shared heritage and common enemies, it has been decided that we shall seek a formal alliance with Tenpony Tower. Unfortunately, we're not certain how they've changed over the centuries, and we very much doubt that they are still the same as the Ministry of old. As a result, we shouldn't be surprised if they reject this proposal entirely or even if they have no idea what the Ministry even is, though we would be very disappointed if they had lost so much."
masevent.316.a:0 "An envoy shall be sent at once."
