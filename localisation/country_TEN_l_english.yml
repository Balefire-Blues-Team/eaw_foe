TEN.1.title:0 "The MAS hub"
TEN.1.desc:0 "Tenpony Tower. A luxury hotel, known for housing the Ministry of Arcane Science's Manehatten Hub. When Balefire began raining from the sky, those ponies working within the Hub were some of the first to know. Orders came in from Canterlot to fire the prototype megaspell Celestia One at Roam, capital of the Zebra empire. Knowing that Manehatten would be a primary target, the ponies of the Ministry had to make a choice. They could follow their orders and focus on casting the megaspell, or ignore their orders and focus on using the Manehatten Emergency Broadcasting System to warn the residents of the city. There wouldn't be enough time to do both, and the seconds were ticking down."
TEN.1.a:0 "Sound the Emergency Broadcast System"
TEN.1.b:0 "Fire Celestia One!"


TEN.2.title:0 "Walls of Balefire"
TEN.2.desc:0 "Tenpony Tower was able to survive the wrath of the Balefire bombs thanks to a series of thick steel walls that coat the MAS hub, unfortunately it was still heavily damaged with the outer walls ripped apart and not a single window survived the shockwave. Soon after irradiated air seeped into the tower. A group of volunteers had requested that they take their protective suits from their labs and go out to repair and fortify the outer walls. Another group had proposed that they’d leave the outer walls to be used as a trap for Ghouls and other abominations and instead focused on fortifying the still functional inner walls."
TEN.2.a:0 "Repair the outer wall"
TEN.2.b:0 "Fortify the inner walls"

TEN.3.title:0 "Outside Communication"
TEN.3.desc:0 "The years following the Balefire were harsh, even to the relatively lucky occupants of Tenpony Tower. The Tower was never stocked to be a long-term survival shelter, and the M.A.S.'s emergency provisions would only last so long. As a result, the ponies within rapidly found themselves running out of food and supplies alike. So, the moment the radiation levels outside were deemed "acceptable", a scavenging expedition was launched to obtain crucial supplies. However, the ponies of this expedition quickly found that they were not the only ones within the devastated ruins of Manehatten. They found a nearby settlement, built with scrap on top of old ruins. Upon getting closer to the settlement, they were shocked to find it full of the undead! The expedition backed away and considered their options. They could attempt to approach these things and see if they were willing to trade. Alternatively, they put an end to these abominations and take all they have. After all, what need do the dead have for food?"
TEN.3.a:0 "Try approaching the zombies."
TEN.3.b:0 "Make the dead stay dead."
