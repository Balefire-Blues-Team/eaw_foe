### Opening Focuses ###
TEN_ministry_hub:0 "The MAS Ministry Hub"
TEN_ministry_hub_desc:0 "The Manehattan Hub of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences was at the center of all of their operations within the Manehattan region. The building it was located in, known as Tenpony Tower, also served as a civilian hotel, which was used as a front for the Hub itself."

TEN_the_war:0 "The Damaged Tower"
TEN_the_war_desc:0 "Despite the various reinforcements and magical wards placed on Tenpony Tower, the building still suffered substantial damage during the end of the world. While much of this damage has been repaired over the past couple of centuries, some scars still remain."

TEN_communication:0 "Outside Communications"
TEN_communication_desc:0 "The residents of Tenpony couldn't just hide away in their tower forever. Eventually, they had to venture out into the ruins of Manehattan, where various dangers and horrors awaited them."

### The Library ###
TEN_library:0 "Twilight Sparkle's Athenaeum"
TEN_library_desc:0 "Twilight Sparkle was a known collector and preserver of books. Just about every MAS Hub was home to at least one stash of books, and our own holds much more than one."

TEN_Banned_section:0 "Banned Section"
TEN_Banned_section_desc:0 "Among Twilight's books were many relating to waging war. While these books won't be available to the general public, they will be very useful in training our security forces."

TEN_Unicorn_tech:0 "Lethal Unicorn Spells"
TEN_Unicorn_tech_desc:0 "Basic combat spells are common across the Wasteland. However, more complex spells have been all but forgotten since the end of the War. Fortunately for us, we are now in possession of several books on just that topic."

TEN_weapon_tech:0 "Prototype Weapon Blueprints"
TEN_weapon_tech_desc:0 "The Ministry Mare was dedicated to preserving knowledge in all of its forms. To our surprise, this also included things such as schematics and blueprints, most notably relating to various weaponry."

TEN_military_section:0 "Military Tactic Section"
TEN_military_section_desc:0 "Military history has been all but lost to the recesses of time. Until now, that is. Armed with the knowledge of hundreds of defeats and victories from battles from the far past, we can effectively analyze and improve upon our own strategies."

TEN_army_doctrine:0 "Army Tactics"
TEN_army_doctrine_desc:0 "Armies form the foundation of any successful military. From Equestria's armies during the Great War, to the ancient armies of the Griffonian Empire, there are many we can learn from regarding how to most effectively use our infantry."

TEN_navy_doctrine:0 "Naval Tactics"
TEN_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "The Equestrian Navy was once the mightiest force to sail the seas. They had the largest fleets, the most advanced ships, and the most developed doctrines. We could do well to learn from it."

TEN_air_doctrine:0 "Air Tactics"
TEN_air_doctrine_desc:0 "The idea of air domination was not invented during the Great War. To the contrary, the idea had been around for as long as races capable of flight have existed. Though we may not have wings, we can still study the tactics and methods of the pegasi and griffons in order to develop our own air doctrines."

TEN_public_section:0 "Public Library"
TEN_public_section_desc:0 "Many of the books that we have now freely shared with the public could be very useful in our own pursuits. Engineering, mathematics, arcane theory, and all other manners of knowledge could be very useful indeed."

TEN_robotics_section:0 "Robotic Section"
TEN_robotics_section_desc:0 "Robotics was a relatively new field within wartime Equestria. Reviving this field could be the key to revolutionizing our army and industry alike. "

TEN_industry_section:0 "Industrial Section"
TEN_industry_section_desc:0 "Equestria was undergoing an industrial revolution during the War. Rapid advancements allowed for production on a scale only dreamed of in the past. By learning from their production methods, we could unlock the secrets of mass production."

TEN_engineering_section:0 "Engineering Section"
TEN_engineering_section_desc:0 "Engineering is an art thought long lost. With the knowledge we have now, we could revive the field as a whole. Electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineering alike can be revived in the Wasteland. We even have books on environmental engineering!"

TEN_ideology_books:0 "Ideological Books"
TEN_ideology_books_desc:0 "The Ministry Mare hated to see any books destroyed, even those containing seditious material. She made an effort to preserve these books, and was rumored to have received a copy of each book destroyed by the Ministry of Image. Now, this leaves us with many of those books deemed too dangerous to be available to the public."

TEN_burn_books:0 "Burn the Books!"
TEN_burn_books_desc:0 "We can not allow such seditious ideas to poison the minds of our ponies! Just as the Ministry of Image did during the War, we shall censor and destroy that knowledge which poses a threat to our way of being."

TEN_Release_books:0 "Release the Books"
TEN_Release_books_desc:0 "Knowledge should be shared freely, regardless of whether or not it agrees with our worldview. While some ponies could begin to advocate for radical ideals, that is a risk we must take in our dedication to preserving knowledge."

TEN_ghoul_problem:0 "Ghoul Problem"
TEN_ghoul_problem_desc:0 "There's a group of ghouls who have been causing trouble for us as of late. They'll need to be dealt with, in one way or another."

TEN_hire_mercenaries:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
TEN_hire_mercenaries_desc:0 "The Twilight Society is hesitant to take action against the ghouls. Chief Grim Star has realized that he must go around them if he wishes to render the ghouls a non-issue."

### Continuation path ###

TEN_ghouls_slaughtered:0 "Ghouls Slaughtered"
TEN_ghouls_slaughtered_desc:0 "The ghouls have been dealt with, and Tenpony Tower is now safe."

TEN_new_members:0 "New Member of the Administration"
TEN_new_members_desc:0 "A note in your pocket, a meeting in the dead of night. You decide to attend."

TEN_council_meeting:0 "First Council Meeting"
TEN_council_meeting_desc:0 "It's time for the Council to meet and decide what to do moving forward."

TEN_organize_celebration:0 "Organize a Celebration"
TEN_organize_celebration_desc:0 "To celebrate our great tower and to lift the spirits of our residents, we shall hold a grand celebration. There will be fine wines, finer cheeses, and ballroom dancing. It'll be a jolly good time! However, quite a lot of planning must go into such a grand event."

TEN_party_debat:0 "Party Budget Debate"
TEN_party_debat_desc:0 "Some within the Council have raised concerns regarding the planned budget for the celebration. Many believe our money would be better spent elsewhere, but others argue that we should spare no expense to make this the greatest party Manehattan has seen since before the War."

TEN_military_budget:0 "Discuss Military Budget Cuts"
TEN_military_budget_desc:0 "While the security and safety of our residents is always of utmost concern, the question must be raised if it is really necessary to be ready to fight a war at all times. Perhaps the security budget could be shifted towards more important matters, like our party?"

TEN_inspect_renovation:0 "Inspect Mall Renovation"
TEN_inspect_renovation_desc:0 "The Mall must be renovated if it is to serve as the grandest trading hub of all of Manehattan! We shall oversee this process to ensure that it is the height of opulence."

TEN_secret_chambers:0 "The Secret Chambers"
TEN_secret_chambers_desc:0 "Somepony once said, \"I wish Tenpony Tower was just half the size and fully explored.\" And frankly - he's right. Not a month goes by that we don't receive reports of ponies who stumble across unknown rooms with sometimes unknown creatures as well. However, a recent discovery showed that, with a bit of luck, one can find true gold mines."

TEN_unusual_find:0 "An Unusual Find"
TEN_unusual_find_desc:0 "Deep within the Hub resides a door with more wards and security than anywhere else within the entire tower. Who knows what could be behind it?"

TEN_real_society:0 "The Twilight Society"
TEN_real_society_desc:0 "The Twilight Society is the secretive ruling council of Tenpony. Though the public believes that the Tenpony Administration is in charge, they are little more than a front for the Twilight Society itself. They have ruled the tower since the War ended, and consider themselves the successors to the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. "

TEN_protect_celestia_line:0 "Protect the Celestia Line"
TEN_protect_celestia_line_desc:0 "Manehattan's Celestia Line offers both a valuable trade route and an easy method to travel across the city. We must secure, protect, and maintain it if we wish to put it to use."

TEN_gutterville_scrap:0 "Gutterville Scrap"
TEN_gutterville_scrap_desc:0 "Gutterville is a small settlement of scavengers struggling to get by in the ruins of Manehattan. While they may be a bit less civilized than our own residents, they know the city like the back of their hooves. By working with them, we can find all sorts of usable material."

TEN_economy_issue:0 "Dwindling Financial Budget"
TEN_economy_issue_desc:0 "Our economy is very import based. Right now, everything works fine, but what if our trade partners turn against us, or get conquered by someone who doesn't have our best in mind? Keeping our current course is too much of a risk and we need to be more self-sustaining."

TEN_import_prewar_food:0 "Import Cheap Pre-war food"
TEN_import_prewar_food_desc:0 "Despite being hundreds of years old, most pre-war Equestrian food is still edible. And even though it tastes like it as well, it's cheap and it has all the nutrients a pony needs."

TEN_import_meat_Arbu:0 "Import Radigator Meat From Arbu"
TEN_import_meat_Arbu_desc:0 "The small town of Arbu is well-known for its Radigator meat. It is said to be fresh, healthy, and delicious, even though it tastes a bit weird sometimes. It may not be our cheapest food source, but it's definitely better than that old pre-war food."

TEN_restaurant_recipes:0 "Restaurant Recipes"
TEN_restaurant_recipes_desc:0 "Due to the rising complaints about the meals tasting worse than, I quote, "my dead grandmother's hooves", our chefs desperately looked for a way to please the ponies, while keeping the food still cheap. Luckily, they found a few cookbooks, and their meals taste like nothing now, which is an improvement."

TEN_elite_cuisine:0 "Elite Cuisine"
TEN_elite_cuisine_desc:0 "In the past months, our best chefs tried every possibility, to make the already great Radigator meat even more delicious. After countless nights of experiments with all sorts of ingredients, they have gathered dozens of recipes, and our cuisine is known throughout the entire wasteland, for its manifold ways of preparing the precious meat. "

TEN_support_local_merchants:0 "Support Local Merchants"
TEN_support_local_merchants_desc:0 "We have finally solved our food problem. The main reason why we had to deal with it in the first place was that we were relying too much on foreign countries. It's only reasonable that we support domestic businesses over foreign ones."

TEN_attract_foreign_merchants:0 "Attract Foreign Merchants"
TEN_attract_foreign_merchants_desc:0 "We have finally secured a stable and reliable food source, and by attracting foreign merchants, we could get a nice little bonus. Some fear that we will rely on imports again, but this time, we have a food source to keep us alive in times of need."

TEN_military_contracts:0 "Sign Military Contracts"
TEN_military_contracts_desc:0 "A worker is useless if he has no factory to work in in the first place. Luckily, some foreign gunsmiths and companies have shown interest in us, and they are willing to invest in building a factory."

TEN_increase_wages:0 "Increase Worker Wages"
TEN_increase_wages_desc:0 "A worker does not work because of his loyalty to Tenpony, but rather because of the money we pay him. This means, that if we pay him badly, he works less and eventually moves to a place with higher wages. So why not give the workers a little pay rise, to show them our appreciation?"

TEN_recovering_economy:0 "Recovering Economy"
TEN_recovering_economy_desc:0 "After months and months of hard work, we not only got our economy back on track, but we have become a major power as well. We can finally move on to spread our sphere of influence and compete with the rest of the wasteland."

TEN_contact_gutterville_settlement:0 "Make Contact with Gutterville"
TEN_contact_gutterville_settlement_desc:0 "While we've already begun cooperating with the residents of Gutterville, we have neglected to contact their leadership thus far. In the interest of furthering our involvement with their settlement, it would do us well to send an envoy to whoever they consider their leader."

TEN_guard_gutterville:0 "Guard Gutterville"
TEN_guard_gutterville_desc:0 "Gutterville has been plagued by nothing but trouble throughout its entire history. Raiders, manticores, rogue spritebots, and more have constantly threatened the residents of the shantytown. We shall send our own security forces to protect their town, and keep their residents safe from all that would threaten them."

TEN_clear_MoM_hub:0 "Clear the MoM Hub"
TEN_clear_MoM_hub_desc:0 "The Ministry of Morale's Hub is the source of the seemingly endless swarm of spritebots that have relentlessly attacked Gutterville since it was first founded. The rogue robots seem to be stuck on their security protocols, and are very aggressively carrying out their duties. If we wish to get at what's inside the Hub, we must first begin by wiping out the machines that guard it."

TEN_scavenge_MoM:0 "Scavenge the MoM Hub"
TEN_scavenge_MoM_desc:0 "There surely must be more robots where the ones we destroyed came from. Stored inside the MoM hub, inactive, and waiting to be used one day. It would be a miracle if these didn't work anymore, and by selling all their different parts, we could make a small fortune."

TEN_fortify_MoM:0 "Fortify the MoM Hub"
TEN_fortify_MoM_desc:0 "There surely must be more robots where the ones we destroyed came from. So it's maybe not the worst idea to keep them locked inside of the MoM hub for good. The hub is a large building, so instead of scavenging what's inside, we should spend our few resources on turning it into a huge fortress."

TEN_form_MTC:0 "Form the MTC"
TEN_form_MTC_desc:0 "We have finally secured the situation on the 'home front', as the pre-war Equestrians said, and we are now in a position to expand our sphere of influence. We have already expanded our grasp on our neighbors, so they would be a good start."

TEN_invite_Gutterville:0 "Invite Gutterville"
TEN_invite_Gutterville_desc:0 "We have assisted Gutterville greatly in the past, and it's now time that they give us something in return. We already have enough soldiers and equipment, but what we do lack is an ally."

TEN_Gutterville_workposts:0 "Set Up Scavenger Workposts"
TEN_Gutterville_workposts_desc:0 "The scavengers of Gutterville may be experienced, but they are also largely disorganized. By organizing them into work units and creating a system for choosing which ruins to scavenge, we can greatly increase their efficiency."

TEN_tackle_manticores:0 "Tackle Manticore Problem"
TEN_tackle_manticores_desc:0 "Manticore's have been a persistent problem within Manehattan. It's about time that we find their breeding grounds so we can deal with them once and for all."

TEN_help_marelem:0 "Send Help to Marelem"
TEN_help_marelem_desc:0 "Our western neighbor, Marelem, is about as large as us, but much weaker. In fact, they are so weak, that they can't even defend themselves against the Manehattan Raiders. We, however, have the means to help them and it would be unfair if we didn't. Perhaps we can profit from it too."

TEN_protect_marelem:0 "Protect Marelem"
TEN_protect_marelem_desc:0 "Those raiders are tougher than we expected. However, they've only faced the small garrison we've stationed at Marelem thus far. It's time we show them our full force."

TEN_boost_marelem:0 "Boost Marelem's Economy"
TEN_boost_marelem_desc:0 "Due to those raiders, Marelem was never able to build up a proper industry, since every new factory would have been immediately destroyed. However, the Manehattan Raiders have been repelled, and with some financial incentive, Marelem's ponies can finally experience what civilization looks like."

TEN_deal_with_MRA:0 "Deal With the Manehattan Raiders"
TEN_deal_with_MRA_desc:0 "It's time we finally deal with those raiders once and for all. For far too long, we've been trying to cast them out of our lands, and it's starting to get embarrassing. A final demonstration of force should show the Wasteland that we can handle a few raiders with ease."

TEN_raiderwar_aftermath:0 "Aftermath of the Raider War"
TEN_raiderwar_aftermath_desc:0 "The land we have taken from the raiders is practically useless. Endless, barren, and sparsely inhabited ruins and wastes with no proper use for us. By giving one or two provinces to our little ally, it would provide the perfect opportunity for them to prove themselves, wouldn't it?"

TEN_invite_marelem:0 "Invite Marelem"
TEN_invite_marelem_desc:0 "While Marelem is practically under our protection, we never signed any form of a formal agreement. Surely, the good ponies of Marelem would never refuse such a treaty, considering all the benefits they would receive by staying with us. And if they think they don't need our help, then that's fine by us too."

TEN_fetlock_autonomy:0 "Give Fetlock Some Autonomy"
TEN_fetlock_autonomy_desc:0 "The little town of Fetlock has shown to be a little problem recently. Apparently, its citizens see us as oppressors and some even started to violently revolt against our rule. Fetlock isn't really worth fighting for, so why not accommodate those rebels a bit and give them some formal autonomy?"

TEN_create_neutral_zone:0 "Create The Manehattan Scavenger Zone"
TEN_create_neutral_zone_desc:0 "Frankly, we don't have any need for most of the land west of Tenpony. We have invested so many resources into guarding it and have gotten almost nothing from that barren land in return. Luckily, [MAR.GetLeader] is able and willing to rule that land, so why not let him do it for us?"

TEN_loot_raider_base:0 "Loot the Orangedale armory"
TEN_loot_raider_base_desc:0 "The Manehattan Raider's might have been a bunch of uncivilized barbarians, but they sure had one hell of an armory. An armory that is now ours."

TEN_settle_orangedale:0 "Settle Orangedale"
TEN_settle_orangedale_desc:0 "Orangedale was one of the most notorious raider dens in Manehattan, being a center for all sorts of raider activities. Chems were traded freely, slaves were marched through the streets, and we're told that the arena was the height of entertainment. That kind of filth is of course not welcome in our nation. However, we can still restore the settlement as a beacon of proper civilization."

TEN_scavenge_program:0 "Set up Scavenge Programs"
TEN_scavenge_program_desc:0 "The ruins of Manehattan are plentiful in resources, if we know where to look. We will establish a scavenging program to find those jewels within the sea of rubble, that may then be put to good use."

TEN_orangedale_construction:0 "Orangedale Construction Company"
TEN_orangedale_construction_desc:0 "You can hardly tell that Orangedale was once a raider settlement. The graffiti is gone, the gore has been cleaned up, and only a few empty syringes still litter the ground. With its newfound civilization has come a newfound economy, and it is rapidly becoming a prosperous trading hub. To help it along this path, we will provide funding for the establishment of a proper construction company, which may help them build a proper town out of the ruins."

TEN_new_Opportunities:0 "New Opportunities"
TEN_new_Opportunities_desc:0 "The civilizing of Manehattan has brought with it a variety of benefits, among those being the new markets for our fine businessponies."

TEN_expand_Gutterville:0 "Expand Business to Gutterville"
TEN_expand_Gutterville_desc:0 "Gutterville was a poor hovel full of poorer ponies. That is, until we civilized it. Now the ponies of Gutterville are enjoying protection, trade, and prosperity. Making them an ideal target for our own economic expansion."

TEN_gutterville_armorshop:0 "Gutterville Armorshop"
TEN_gutterville_armorshop_desc:0 "Armor is a necessity within the Wasteland. Without it, your chances of survival decrease drastically. Unfortunately, the armor market is far from prosperous. To help resolve this, we'll help establish proper armor production and sales within Gutterville."

TEN_gutterville_materials:0 "Gutterville Materials"
TEN_gutterville_materials_desc:0 "The ruins around Gutterville are full of scrap metal, concrete, and other useful materials. The mighty towers of Manehattan were once built from these materials, and soon they shall be rebuilt with the very same. To help facilitate this, we shall establish a company within the settlement dedicated entirely to using these scavenged materials for construction."

TEN_expand_marelem:0 "Expand Business to Marelem"
TEN_expand_marelem_desc:0 "Marelem has been civilized. The raiders that once plagued them are no more, and their ponies living standards are rapidly improving. More importantly though, a new market has opened for us."

TEN_marelem_bar:0 "The Marelem Entertainment District"
TEN_marelem_bar_desc:0 "The less civilized ponies who come through our territory and even our tower unfortunately have far less refined tastes than our great residents. Though we would never sink so low as to appease such lesser desires within our tower itself, some of our more innovative businessponies have come up with a solution. A large portion of Marlem may be designated as an 'entertainment district', where those businesses that usually would not be accepted are allowed to flourish. It will include all sorts of ruffian interests, such as blackjack and hard liquor."

TEN_nonlethal_bullet_factory:0 "Non-lethal Bullet Factory"
TEN_nonlethal_bullet_factory_desc:0 "Most of our security within the tower itself use rubber ammunition and aim to arrest rather than kill any troublemakers. Unfortunately, our entire supply of these bullets comes from the Great War, and our supply is beginning to run low. In order to solve this issue, we will begin manufacturing our own."

TEN_trade_barons:0 "The Trade Barons"
TEN_trade_barons_desc:0 "Our fine businesses have always been a core aspect of our little community. However, some members of our Society have begun to raise concerns regarding just how much sway these businesses now seem to wield. The question has been raised as to whether we still control our own tower, or if those so-called 'trade barons' do. "

TEN_friend_friendshipcity:0 "Befriend Friendship City"
TEN_friend_friendshipcity_desc:0 "Friendship City is, as far as we can tell, a perfectly respectable settlement. Their people are nice enough, their traders are glad to engage with our own, and they are more than willing to remain on good terms with us. So, it would only make sense for us to treat them in kind and pursue a cooperative relationship."

### Midtown ###

TEN_outskirts:0 "The Tenpony Outskirts"
TEN_outskirts_desc:0 "Not far away from Tenpony, to the west, lies Midtown. It was originally a settlement of the ponies who were refused entrance into the tower, but over time, it has grown to a large town. Occasionally, some of its settlers come to Tenpony to trade. This presents an opportunity for us to exploit."

TEN_midtown_forge:0 "Midtown Forge"
TEN_midtown_forge_desc:0 "We should expand our investment in Midtown. Enough caps to build a forge, where the workers can create all kinds of things with scrap metal, would be a good first step into the settlement's modernization."

TEN_scrap_refinement:0 "Scrap Refinement"
TEN_scrap_refinement_desc:0 "The ponies of Midtown are not the uncivilized savages that some in the tower believe them to be. In fact, they are quite skilled. They found a way to make composite materials out of scrap metal, which can be a great boost to our industry."

TEN_midtown_tools:0 "Tools of the Trade"
TEN_midtown_tools_desc:0 "The new forge in Midtown is proving to be a good investment, as it now produces enough tools that salvaging prewar tools is no longer necessary."

TEN_midtown_weapons:0 "Midtown Arms Factory"
TEN_midtown_weapons_desc:0 "A group of gunsmiths cooperated with us to construct a new arms factory in Midtown. It will be a great help in supplying our troops with proper and reliable firearms in the future, and the only thing they want in return are funds for their newly founded company."

TEN_midtown_homes:0 "Develop New Homes"
TEN_midtown_homes_desc:0 "The average Midtown resident lives in a simple shack building, which is, to put it nicely, not very weatherproof. We should build more modern and durable houses, so that the citizens of Midtown can at least get a small taste of Tenpony's living standards."

TEN_midtown_roads:0 "Roads of Midtown"
TEN_midtown_roads_desc:0 "With the new homes, more ponies from the surrounding regions are moving to Midtown. While this is, at first glance, a positive development, it also means the already old and damaged roads are now hopelessly overloaded. We should repair and expand the current road system, in order to support the new flow of ponies."

TEN_midtown_recycle:0 "Midtown Recycle Center"
TEN_midtown_recycle_desc:0 "In order to save resources, we should construct a recycling center where workers can make tools out of the materials we found in Manehattan's ruins."

TEN_midtown_electronics:0 "Wasteland Electronics"
TEN_midtown_electronics_desc:0 "Radios were a common luxury in pre-war Equestria. Not only were they a good way to kill some time, but they were also a quick and reliable way to deliver any messages, military or civilian. We already have a radio station, now all we need to do is create more radios."

TEN_midtown_factory:0 "Factory for the Tower"
TEN_midtown_factory_desc:0 "While improving the standards of living in Midtown is admirable, we can't forgot about the heart of our nation. Why not combine the useful with the practical and build a factory in Midtown, where workers produce goods that are later sold to our values residents?"

TEN_midtown_research_slot:0 "Tenpony-Midtown Research Coalition"
TEN_midtown_research_slot_desc:0 "We have come a long way in modernizing Midtown. With their wasteland-knowledge and our pre-war-knowledge, future breakthroughs should be achieved a lot quicker."

TEN_security_coup:0 "Security Coup"
TEN_security_coup_desc:0 "The disgraced Chief of Security, Grim Star, lies within Tenpony's cells. His avid ambitions for Tenpony and all of Manehattan currently lay unaccomplishable, unless a certain series of events were to unfold..."

TEN_evening_curfew:0 "Evening Curfew"

TEN_fate_of_society:0 "Fate of the Society"
TEN_fate_of_society_desc:0 "The leaders of the Twilight Society have been captured, and their fates now remain at the judgement of Grim Star. Their main leadership will be tried for betraying Tenpony Tower and its residents."

TEN_slaugther_ghouls_desc:0 "With the Twilight Society out of our way, Grim Star can finally start unfolding his ambitions. We will start with what the Society refused to accomplish: Rottingtail and his followers meeting their deserved fate."

TEN_repurpose_mall:0 "Repurpose the Mall"
TEN_repurpose_mall_desc:0 "The mall of Tenpony is quite vast, although many of its rooms are useless shops selling counterproductive luxuries. We can remodel the mall into a productive manufactory that will actually benefit Tenpony."

TEN_convert_shops:0 "Convert the Shops Into Factories"

TEN_grim_economy_desc:0 "The merchants of Tenpony enjoy lives of luxury and riches unimaginable to most ponies in the Wasteland. They sit here, enjoying fine wines and cheeses within the walls protected by our brave security forces. Why should these lazy do-nothings be allowed to hoard wealth while those ponies actually working to keep the tower safe are barely afforded even the smallest of luxuries? From now on, all businesses operating within Tenpony will be expected to pay a heavy protection tax, which shall be used to drastically increase our security funding."

TEN_mandatory_conscription:0 "Mandatory Conscription"
TEN_mandatory_conscription_desc:0 "Our current 'military' consists of mercenaries and hired guards, giving our ranks an unloyal connotation. A mandatory conscription will be created, so that we may draft anypony lacking any crucial contribution to the tower.

TEN_conscript_elite:0 "Conscript the Elite"
TEN_conscript_elite_desc:0 "Despite our draft gathering many new recruits, there are still veterans of the tower that remain elusive to the conscription. A new, stronger conscription wave will commence, if only for the betterment of Tenpony's military."

TEN_no_special_privilege:0 "No Special Privilege"

TEN_stop_bats_desc:0 "These evil creatures in Marelem proclaim themselves peaceful and claim that they mean no harm to Manehattan.

TEN_purify_marelem:0 "Purify Marelem"
TEN_purify_marelem_desc:0 "The city of Marelem has been conquered, but it's fanged denizens plague it still. These bats shall be purified under orders of Grim Star; it is the only way that the light of proper authority can finally shine on Marelem."

TEN_marelem_jail_desc:0 "The idea of a proper prison has trotted our minds for a while, and with our new land and resources, it can potentially become a reality. A bleak penitentiary shall be built in southern Marelem to hold Tenpony's criminals."

TEN_prison_labour:0 "Prison Labour"
TEN_prison_labour_desc:0 "The construction of the prison has been useful to housing our political dissidents, but there are still other uses we could have for our inmates. They can be put to work doing manual prison labour, to perhaps better serve their miserable lives."

TEN_Gutterville_scrapworkers:0 "Gutterville Scrapworkers"
TEN_Gutterville_scrapworkers_desc:0 "One of the few positives of controlling Gutterville is owning its vast quantities of scrap.

TEN_grimstar_scavenge_MoM_desc:0 "The Ministry of Morale's old hub in Manehattan now lies within our terrtiroy, although it is still ridden with hostile sprite-bots. With protection from our guards and some charismatic persuasion, we can send paid volunteers to help scavenge the Hub."

TEN_invade_raiders:0 "Make Manehattan Raiderfree Again"
TEN_invade_raiders_desc:0 "Raiders: chaotic, warmongering barbarians that exist only to corrupt the Wasteland, giving it the dangerous reputation it does not deserve. This proves no different for our local Manehattan Raiders, and we shall do our part to rid Manehattan of this menace."

TEN_Manehattan_Overstallion:0 "The Overstallion of Manehattan"
TEN_Manehattan_Overstallion_desc:0 "The Tower lies firmly in Grimstar's hoof. His reforms are in place, the army he created is awaiting his orders and the Society is no longer a threat.

TEN_form_south_manehattan:0 "South Manehattan"

TEN_medkit_research:0 "First Aid Kits"
TEN_medkit_research_desc:0 "A dead soldier can't fight. We must invest in medical equipment to assure that as few soldiers as possible die from combat. That way, they may live to fight another day."

TEN_infantry_equipment:0 "Infantry Equipment"
TEN_infantry_equipment_desc:0 "Despite the recent developments and advancements in robotics, a large part of our army still consists of basic infantry.

TEN_penal_squads:0 "Penal Squads"
TEN_penal_squads_desc:0 "If there is a law, then there are ponies who break it too. The old Equestria would have just locked them away, but that would be economically stupid.

TEN_design_medium_ship:0 "Grander Ships!"
TEN_design_medium_ship_desc:0 "While lighter ships may have their uses, it's quite clear they don't last long during the thick of combat. Heavier ship models will be designed, so that our ships may last through the numerous naval engagements to come."

TEN_medium_ship_focus:0 "Tenpony Vessels"
TEN_medium_ship_focus_desc:0 "Medium sized vessels provide their strength in all-around effectiveness. They have the size of smaller, more maneuverable ships while boasting an increased amount of capable firepower."

TEN_design_heavy_ship:0 "Even Grander Ships!"
TEN_design_heavy_ship_desc:0 "A ship may always be improved and expanded upon, even if it takes more resources to build and a larger crew to maintain. Designing even larger ships will bring Tenpony's capable naval strength to Manehattan's waters."

TEN_heavy_ship_focus:0 "Tenpony Warships"
TEN_heavy_ship_focus_desc:0 "Heavy ships are undoubtedly unmatched in naval combat. Although costly to produce, their ability to trek through arduous campaigns makes them perfect for engaging on Tenpony's shores and rivers."

TEN_improve_propulsion:0 "Improve Ship Propulsion"
TEN_improve_propulsion_desc:0 "A ship is useless if it lacks the speed to do anything. Better propulsion systems will be designed so that Tenpony's navy can keep up with any rival boat."

TEN_naval_detection:0 "Eyes of the Ship"
TEN_naval_detection_desc:0 "Detection systems are paramount to the ultimate safety of our ships, and even a ship's simplest detection methods start with the eyes of any capable mariner."

TEN_floating_tanks:0 "Floating Fortresses"
TEN_floating_tanks_desc:0 "New armour modules allow us to coat our ships with stronger plating, more resistant materials and a more durable ship overall. Only after strengthening our ships with Tenpony's most durable metals will we be able to transform our ships into the floating fortresses they are meant to be."

TEN_ship_communications:0 "Ship Communications"
TEN_ship_communications_desc:0 "Communication within a crew is essential, lest an entire ship crumbles internally before it does externally. Improved communication modules as well as revised methods shall ensure any Tenpony crew is a capable crew."

TEN_learn_cloudship:0 "Learn From the Cloudship"
TEN_learn_cloudship_desc:0 "Long ago, Equestria's mighty air force once had ships that were capable of flying across the sky. Though we lack the means to create these flying monstrosities for ourselves, we can still try to learn from their designs in order to improve our own seafaring vessels."

TEN_rustwreck_ships:0 "Study Rustwreck Ships"
TEN_rustwreck_ships_desc:0 "Dotting the coasts and shores of Rustwreck are a great deal of old wartime ships once belonging to Equestria's navy. We can learn much from this ancient beasts, which once dominated the seas."

TEN_rooftop_AA:0 "Protect the Tenpony Rooftop"

TEN_they_shall_not_cross:0 "They Shall Not Cross!"
TEN_they_shall_not_cross_desc:0 "The Manehattan River spans and divides our fair city. If the Enclave wishes to get to our tower, they have no choice but to cross over it, be that by bridge, air, or water. It is therefore in our interest to prevent them from doing so."

### Advisors ###

grimstar_advisor:0 "Chief Grim Star"
grimstar_advisor_desc:0 "The long-time captain of Tenpony Security, Chief Grim Star is ever vigilant in ensuring the protection and safety of the tower and it's residents. Though his loyalty to Tenpony is unquestionable, many have doubts regarding his methods."

life_bloom:0 "Life Bloom"
life_bloom_desc:0 "A talented medic and a highly skilled mage. He serves as the Twilight Societies foremost expert in memory magic, and spends much of his time experimenting with various spells. He is also very involved in gathering information about various Tenpony residents."

TEN_silent_workpony:0 "Buckshot"
TEN_silent_workpony_desc:0 ""

TEN_war_industry:0 "Grand Bolt"
TEN_war_industry_desc:0 "Grand Bolt began his career as a weaponsmith apprentice in a small settlement to the far west. He went on to spend much of his life traveling across Equestria, lending his skills and expertise to many different factions and settlements. In the end, he ended up at our fair tower, where he hopes to eventually retire."

TEN_civil_industry:0 "Fair Bit"
TEN_civil_industry_desc:0 "Once upon a time, Fair Bit was just another of the many merchants in the Wasteland, owning a small shop in an equally small settlement to the north. That changed when she discovered a cache of wartime weaponry, which she quickly sold to the highest bidder. The resulting wealth would then be invested into starting up a successful caravan company, which still persists to this day. After amasssing a sizable amount of wealth, she moved down to our tower to enjoy a life of relative luxury."

TEN_scientist:0 "Perfect Precision"
TEN_scientist_desc:0 "Some fields of science, both material and arcane, require that every single variable be exact. Should there be a mistake, it could result in dire consequences. That is why we have Perfect Precision, a truly remarkable pony who has never once been off on a measurement."

society_member_army:0 "Twitchy Hooves"
society_member_army_desc:0 "Twitchy Hooves is hardly what one would expect a security officer to be. He lacks any sort of combat expertise, and has lived most of his life in relative safety. However, he is also a valued member of the Twilight Society, and is highly unlikely to ever step out of line."

TEN_entrenchment:0 "Golden Vision"
TEN_entrenchment_desc:0 "Once upon a time, there was a young colt by the name of Golden Vision. His father, and his father's father, and his father's father's father were all scavengers. So, of course, he knew that someday he too would be a scavenger. That is, until the scrap hut his family lived in collapsed with them inside. He was the only survivor of this incident. This would lead to him vowing to ensure that noponies home would fall in on them ever again. Unfortunately, his dream wouldn't sway the other residents of his town. After a long series of failed campaigns, he would eventually leave the settlement where he grew up. One thing led to another, and he soon found himself in our employ."

TEN_army_morale:0 "Ivory Mane"
TEN_army_morale_desc:0 "Ivory Mane wasn't born to wealth. He grew up in the outskirts of Manehattan, and joined a band of mercenaries at a young age. His mercenary career would be cut short by half of his band, including it's leader, getting killed by raiders. From there, he moved from town to town and providing protection services to anyone who could pay. This would lead him to being under the employ of our tower as a security officer."

TEN_grimstar_special_forces:0 "Chief Grim Star"
TEN_grimstar_special_forces_desc:0 "The long-time captain of Tenpony Security, Chief Grim Star is ever vigilant in ensuring the protection and safety of the tower and it's residents. Though his loyalty to Tenpony is unquestionable, many have doubts regarding his methods."

TEN_twilight_society_member:0 "Short Wit"
TEN_twilight_society_member_desc:0 "If there is one pony who is truly despised within the Twilight Society, it is Short Wit. His lazy apathetic attitude has been the topic of many angry rants from other Society members, and there have been many attempts to kick him out of the Society. All of these attempts have failed though, as he enjoys the favor of the Societies highest ranking members for reasons unknown to most members."

TEN_infantryadvisor:0 "Pure Flame"
TEN_infantryadvisor_desc:0 ""

TEN_logistic:0 "Thundershot"
TEN_logistic_desc:0 "Thundershot has had a long and mostly successful career as a mercenary. He oftentimes became the quartermaster for the companies he joined, a role which he now holds within Tenpony Security."

TEN_organisation:0 "Stout Guardian"
TEN_organisation_desc:0 "Stout Guardian's father was a valued member of Tenpony Security. He grew up knowing that he would one day be wearing a security uniform, and now he does. However, despite his upbringing, he has managed to garner a reputation for being a troublemaker."

TEN_fort:0 "Eternal Stronghold"
TEN_fort_desc:0 "Eternal Stronghold dreams of building forts. So building forts they shall do."

TEN_backroom:0 "Sunny Seduction"
TEN_backroom_desc:0 "If there was one pony within Tenpony Tower who everypony liked, it would be Sunny Seduction. She has managed to talk her way into the good graces of the Twilight Society. Now, she puts her charisma to use convincing everypony of the merits of our leadership."

Midtown_Arms:0 "Midtown Arms Factory"
Midtown_Arms_desc:0 "The Midtown Arms Factory has rapidly become one of our largest arms producers. Their expertise when it comes to weapons manufacturing could prove very useful moving forward."

TEN_landadvisor:0 "Book Bind"
TEN_landadvisor_desc:0 "Book Bind is certainly a bit of an outcast among Tenpony Security. Physically frail and averse to confrontation, he isn't capable of performing many of the day-to-day duties of a security officer. However, his knowledge of historical military tactics is second to none, making him a potentially valuable asset."

TEN_airadvisor:0 "Cloud Dreamer"
TEN_airadvisor_desc:0 "Nopony is sure why Cloud Dreamer is named such. Some claim she took the name herself to reflect her ambitions, while others theorize that she has pegasus ancestors. Whatever the case may be, her name has proven fitting, as she spends much of her time dreaming of flying through the clouds. Few take her seriously, and she wouldn't even be a resident of our tower if not for her extensive knowledge of cloudships and cloudship components. As is, she leads many of our airport salvaging efforts."

TEN_navyadvisor:0 "Wave Prospect"
TEN_navyadvisor_desc:0 "Wave Prospect was once little more than a humble fisherpony. In his youth, he found his boat stranded out at sea during a terrible storm. After the storm came to an end, he found himself in posession of such a large supply of irradiated fish that he could feed half the Wasteland for months. From there, he led a successful fishing company for a long time, before selling his assets and retiring to our tower. His knowledge regarding naval management and operations could come in handy though."

TEN_air_reform_horse:0 "Flight Worthy"
TEN_air_reform_horse_desc:0 "Flight Worthy is regarded by some to be little more than an overgrown foal playing a game of pretend. The cardboard wings he insists on wearing everywhere certainly do little to dissuade this perception. Indeed, if it weren't for his inheritance, he would likely have been kicked out long ago. He spends most of his days insisting to anypony who will listen that he is actually a pegasus, and reading about famous Equestrian air battles."

TEN_night_ops_horse:0 "'One-Eye' Marlarkey"
TEN_night_ops_horse_desc:0 "'One-Eye' Malarkey is believed to be one of the oldest residents within our tower. We're not entirely sure where his seemingly endless amounts of wealth originated, and he isn't telling anytime soon. We're also not sure where he learned so much about cloudships, but we're not going to question such expertise when it could be put to good use."

TEN_decisive_navyhorse:0 "Admiral Fleet"
TEN_decisive_navyhorse_desc:0 "Admiral Fleet is not a real admiral, but you would be excused for believing him upon first introduction. His authentic Equestrian admirality uniform and the confidence in which he proclaims his role is enough to convince most ponies with no argument. In actuality, he was once a well-respected Captain in Rustwreck, before he declared himself to be the 'true admiral' and called for Admiral Tides immediate resignation. Unfortunately for him, his own crew wasn't willing to go through with his insane ambitions, and quickly mutinied against him. Following this, he was sent into exile, and is now residing in our tower as a political refugee."

TEN_commerce_navyhorse:0 "Star Board"
TEN_commerce_navyhorse_desc:0 "Star Board used to be a fisherpony who struggled to get by. This changed following the death of her husband after he was thrown overboard during a storm. Her life then took a drastic turn, as she gave up a life of fishing in exchange for a life of piracy. She never became too infamous, but she still managed to pillage more than enough valuables to fund her retirement to our tower."

### EVENTS ###
##############
TEN.1.title:0 "The MAS Hub"
TEN.1.desc:0 "Tenpony Tower. A luxury hotel, known for housing the Ministry of Arcane Science's Manehattan Hub. When balefire began raining from the sky, those ponies working within the Hub were some of the first to know. Orders came in from Canterlot to fire the prototype megaspell Celestia One at Roam, capital of the Zebrican Empire. Knowing that Manehattan would be a primary target, the ponies of the Ministry had to make a choice. They could follow their orders and focus on casting the megaspell, or ignore their orders and focus on using the Manehattan Emergency Broadcasting System to warn the residents of the city. There wouldn't be enough time to do both, and the seconds were ticking down."
TEN.1.a:0 "Sound the Emergency Broadcast System."
TEN.1.b:0 "Fire Celestia One!"

TEN.2.title:0 "Walls of Balefire"
TEN.2.desc:0 "Tenpony Tower was able to survive the wrath of the balefire bombs thanks to a series of thick steel walls that coat the MAS Hub. Unfortunately, it was still heavily damaged with the outer walls ripped apart and not a single window survived the shockwave. Soon after irradiated air seeped into the tower. A group of volunteers had requested that they take their protective suits from their labs and go out to repair and fortify the outer walls. Another group had proposed that they'd leave the outer walls to be used as a trap for ghouls and other abominations and instead focused on fortifying the still functional inner walls."
TEN.2.a:0 "Repair the outer wall."
TEN.2.b:0 "Fortify the inner walls."

TEN.3.title:0 "Outside Communication"
TEN.3.desc:0 "The years following the balefire were harsh, even to the relatively lucky occupants of Tenpony Tower. The tower was never stocked to be a long-term survival shelter, and the MAS's emergency provisions would only last so long. As a result, the ponies within rapidly found themselves running out of food and supplies alike. So, the moment the radiation levels outside were deemed "acceptable", a scavenging expedition was launched to obtain crucial supplies. However, the ponies of this expedition quickly found that they were not the only ones within the devastated ruins of Manehattan. They found a nearby settlement, built with scrap on top of old ruins. Upon getting closer to the settlement, they were shocked to find it full of the undead! The expedition backed away and considered their options. They could attempt to approach these things and see if they were willing to trade. Alternatively, they put an end to these abominations and take all they have. After all, what need do the dead have for food?"
TEN.3.a:0 "Try approaching the zombies."
TEN.3.b:0 "Make the dead stay dead."

TEN.4.title:0 "Ghoul Problem"
TEN.4.desc:0 "Life in our tower was very serene, safe and calm (for those who had the caps), but it seems that peace can come to an end. One of our major trading partners has provided us with valuable information regarding the ghoul population in Manehattan. Namely, the location of a large settlement of zombies near our tower. It's amazing how they have not attacked us yet, given the carelessness and the unreadiness of our guards when it comes to defending against massive mobs of hostiles. It may just be ghouls, but the problem of their unwanted neighborhood being so close to us needs a solution. We'll begin by sending scouts to get an idea of their population and defences, before we move on to actually preparing to be rid of the problem."
TEN.4.a:0 "We'll send our best to check them out."

TEN.5.title:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
TEN.5.desc:0 "Grim Star sat in his office, pondering on what he heard. A large, by Wasteland standards at least, settlement of ghouls exists right under Tenpony's nose. While most of them were more or less reasonable, their leader was clearly close to becoming feral. Not only that, but Tenpony Security was woefully ill equipped to deal with the issue. The unicorn did not see a way out of this situation, except to contract an outside mercenary company to put an end to the problem once and for all. While smoking a smoldering cigarette, he turned his gaze out the window and gazed at the ruins of skyscrapers, cracked paved highways, and the rusted remains of the Celestia line. Exhaling smoke, he came to a decision. The mercenaries would be contracted, but the deal would have to be struck under-the-table. The ponies in charge would never agree to such dire action being taken against the ghouls, even if they were personally disgusted by such creatures. Furthermore, they wouldn't agree to spending valuable caps on having mercenaries do such dirty work. And so, throwing away the cigarette butt as it burned his lips, he began writing a contract."
TEN.5.a:0 "Grim Star concludes a contract with Blackwing and her mercenaries."
TEN.5.b:0 "The Twilight Society learns of his plans and stops Grim Star."

TEN.6.title:0 "The Star Fell and Crashed"
TEN.6.desc:0 "What was I hoping for? That they would they praise me, or that they would pat me on the head with a hoof? Grim Star considered the events leading up to his arrest. The negotiations with Blackwing had went well, the contract had been signed, and the griffons promised quick results. However, upon returning to Tenpony Tower, Grim Star quickly found his own security officers pointing guns in his faces. It seems someone from within their ranks had caught wind of this deal and reported him. Whether they were on the Twilight Societies payroll, or they were just seeking personal gain from his removal, he knew not. He could however rest easy knowing that at least the ghouls would still be dealt with, and the tower would be safe. Even if he rotted in this cell for the rest of his life, it would have been worth it for having ensured the safety of Tenpony's residents."
TEN.6.a:0 "He shouldn't of tried to slip something past the Society."

TEN.7.title:0 "Ghouls Slaughtered"
TEN.7.desc:0 "Word has come in that a small peaceful settlement of ghouls has been slaughtered to the last by a band of mercenaries hired by Tenpony's Chief Grim Star. We're afraid that news of this atrocity has already begun to spread across all of Manehattan, and many are now considering our tower to be responsible for it. It's to the point that some settlements are now even considering halting all trade with us and refusing to cooperate with us further. The only silver lining to all this is that we don't have to worry about the ghouls ever attacking us."

All residents are granted free entry and rentals, though outsiders are expected to pay a small fee for such.\n\nIt will also host books from Twilight Sparkle's own personal collection. Much of this rare literature has not been available to the public since before The War itself and has, until now, been lost to time.\n\nWe hope our valued residents will make use of and enjoy this new facility.

While this was very admirable and noble of her, it has led us to our current conundrum. A stash of books once deemed unacceptable for public consumption have been found within one of the many hidden rooms of our tower.\n\n The books in question are a collection of various ideological works. From Caramel Marks works to the autobiography of Aryanne Hoofler, there are all sorts of radical ideas being presented in these books. This has led to a heated debate regarding what we should do with these works. Some members of our Society believe that there is little harm in distributing these books to the public, but others call for the immediate destruction of what they call dangerous literature. We'll have to reach a decision regarding this at some point, though it isn't the most pressing of issues."

TEN.13.desc:0 "You nervously look over your shoulder. The quiet halls of the Tenpony Tower are, as one would predict from the very late hour, empty. The only sound you can hear is the quiet buzzing of the long, weak lights in the ceiling. As you pass door after door leading to various suites for the wealthy residents, your eyes finally lay on the door right at the end of the corridor. The silver-coated plaque on the solid, wooden frame reads '13.4a', which - to your knowledge - is a small storage room for brooms, buckets and other, mostly useless items.\n\n After making sure you have the correct address, you quietly push the door open.\n\n What appears before your eyes is far from what you had expected. The shelf opposite of the door, usually filled with a complete mess of cleaning supplies and old junk, was now standing aside, and behind it - much to your surprise - was a small, obscure passage that led further down. With increased cautiousness you close the door behind you, and then - fighting with the instinct to run away and forget about this entire ordeal - you make your way past the shelf.\n\n As you progress down the small corridor, you encounter another door. Having committed to your choice already, you only slightly hesitate before opening them. Then, before your very eyes, lies a candle-lit room with a round table. A small number of ponies, well-dressed even for Tenpony standards, are sitting around it, with only one chair left vacant: the one closest to you.\n\n\"Have a seat,\" says one of the figures, a dark-red coated stallion with a surprisingly deep voice. Left with no other choice, you follow the request. As you take your place by the table, the same voice speaks out again. \"For the last few decades, Tenpony Tower remained a bastion of civilization in the war-torn ruins of Manehattan. It was not only thanks to the powerful magic protecting its walls, not only because of the disciplined and well-trained security forces, no. Even the most powerful nations need a guiding hoof to lead them and ensure their prosperity.\" A small pause ensued, which was broken by another voice - this one belonging to a mare with a white coat and a silvery mane. \"Throughout generations, we were that guiding hoof. We ensured that the Tenpony Tower would remain strong and safe from the dangers of the outside world. And now we wish you joined us in that endeavor. All ponies suddenly stood up, smiled, and gently bowed their heads as the stallion spoke again."

TEN.14.title:0 "A Change in Management"
TEN.14.desc:0 "Residents awoke this morning to discover that Tenpony Tower had undergone a change in management overnight. A number of security forces loyal to the former disgraced Chief Grim Star have taken full control of the Tower, stationing loyal guards at each security post and declaring martial law. All residents are expected to have a valid reason to move through any security checkpoints, and access to the Administrative District has been fully restricted.\n\nDue to the ongoing lockdown of the Administrative District, the Tenpony Armory has been repurposed to serve as a temporary administrative office for the Tower. All members of the previous Tenpony Administration are currently under house arrest, with their fates uncertain. Various security staff and trusted residents have been appointed to temporarily manage the Tower. \n\nAs for Grim Star himself, he was released from his cell in the early hours of the morning. Though he had very little to do with directing the apparent coup itself, he has now assumed full command of his forces and of the Tower. In an official statement, he had this to say:\n\n\"I wish to reassure every resident of Tenpony Tower that I, and all of Tenpony Security, have only their best interests at heart. Know we did not take this action lightly, but rather, we took it only to protect and further the interests of every one of you. We know that this change may be sudden, and many ponies have already expressed a great deal of concern regarding it. However, we are fully dedicated to ensuring that this transition is as smooth as possible, and we look forward to resuming normal life soon enough. Until then, just remember that we are your friends, not your enemies.\""

And perhaps they would of stood a chance if they were just facing a disorganized gang of raiders, or a small band of slavers. However, much to their misfortune, they weren't facing either of those. Rather, they were facing the full might and force of Tenpony Security!\n\nOn Grim Star's orders, a small army of our finest guards set about wiping out the ghoul threat. Though their makeshift walls may of made our approach difficult, they proved to be the only real obstacle we faced. All it took was blowing them down with explosives, and then charging in. From there, it was like shooting mutated fish in an irradiated barrel. Most of the zombies didn't even have guns!\n\nDespite our success, it isn't all good news. That damned Sheriff Rotting Tail managed to take out several of our brave guards as they were attempting to breach the walls. A funeral service will be held for them, and plans are already being drafted for a monument to their sacrifice. At least Rotting Tail and his ilk will never bother us again."

This terrible move is one that we could of forgiven, if it had been but a misguided act of protectiveness towards our valued residents. However, this was not the case. The traitor's actions then, and since then, have been those of a mad man, who cares only about his own power and little more. What he has down has ruined our great tower, destroyed the lives of our residents, and destroyed our reputation across the wasteland.\n\nThis must end.\n\nAs we speak, those loyal to the cause of serving our residents are moving to secure the Mall. Though the battle may be fierce, and though our losses may be many, we know that it is preferable to Grim Star's ongoing madness. A madness that goes against all this Tower has ever stood for! Even now, he barricades himself in his armory like a coward! We shall drag him out by his flank if we must, and force him to face trial for the crimes he has committed during his illegitimate rule!\n\nWe also are extending an offer to those of you among Grim Star's ranks who are still rational enough to recognize his madness. Any who throw down their arms and surrender will not be held accountable for anything they were forced to do under Grim Star's rule. Rather, they shall be welcomed back as full residents of our beloved Tower, just as soon as we resecure our rule.\n\nTo those resident's still trapped within Grim Star's clutches, we tell you this, hang in there. Help is on the way.\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely, the Tenpony Tower Administration."

A recent discovery just proved this once more.\n\nA few days ago, a maintenance group was clearing out one of the many hallways on the western side of the building. Apparently, a corridor has been buried by countless boxes and other remnants of the former Equestria since the end of the war. After the debris had been removed, our team faced a smaller corridor with four rooms on both sides.\n\nThere is a terminal at the entrance, that used to list all the items inside of them. Most of the data became corrupted by now, however, we managed to restore some of it.\n\nWhile it's not impossible to hack the interlock of the doors, it's time-consuming and our technicians are already needed on other locations, so we can only open one door at once."
TEN.23.a:0 "Life is full of surprises."

TEN.24.title:0 "Heavy Lifters"
TEN.24.desc:0 "Alright, it should work now.\", said the technician as he rebooted the terminal. It was old and rusty, so it took some time. But eventually, it loaded all the data.\n\nHe opened the document and sighed in relief. Some words were still not restored, but at least the file is now readable:\n\"Room 1, corridor 2a:\n50 heavy lifters, used in ×»^'Ë9á¾Ü³>& for the transportation of heavy lab equipment s prototypes. We have better models by now, so only use them as reserves.\n- Prof. Dark dßRÕÄ\"\n\nThe recovery team opened the door, hoping for the best, and they were lucky: Only eight lifters didn't survive over the years. The rest, however, was still intact and functioned properly. Sure, there are more advanced models by now, but if we have no other option, they can do the job too."
TEN.24.a:0 "Now if that's not some good news!"

TEN.25.title:0 "Armor Storage"
TEN.25.desc:0  "Almost... done\", said the technician, struggling to recover the data. \"That should be it. Now we're gonna rebooted this thing and see if it works.\"\n\nWhile the terminal was booting up, the technician was visibly nervous. He knew that if it didn't work, he could start all over. Luckily, his fears have proven untrue and the file was readable again:\n\"Room 3, corridor 2a:\nI know I'm not authorized to do this, but I'm just gonna store these here. Or does anypony ´'íÕSSý§û)? No, so where's the problem? Anyways, a company from èðšñ will come and pick them up next Monday. Three stripped PA, 20 T45d PA, and six T51b PA. All of them are outdated and too damaged or obsolete for the front, so we're gonna sell them. It's not my fault that ¯¶{¸» didn't give me clear orders.\n-Cpt. Swift Wish\"\n\nThe recovery team proceeded to open the door, hoping the power armors were in the same shape as the heavy lifters. One minute later, the door was open and the team relieved. The power armors were still functioning. A bit rusty and old, yes, but nothing that our mechanics can't handle."
TEN.25.a:0 "Say again that something like luck doesn't exist."

TEN.26.title:0 "Ammunition Storage"
TEN.26.desc:0  "Ok, I think I've got the hang on it.\", the technician rebooted the terminal. After four times, he sort of knew what he had to do. The uncertainty, if the data was properly restored or not, was gone - you could almost say that it became a routine. Anyways, everything worked out as expected and most of the data could be saved.\n\n\"Room 5, corridor 2a:\nA convoy arrived today with tons of small arms. That is all well and good, but Major Lucky Star is just an idiot. Not only were we forced to use the stairs instead of the elevator when we brought the boxes up here, but he also had to choose the shabbiest room to store them in. It'll be a wonder if the water pipe survives another week, but then it's not my fault if EÏHÑÓJŸ®Þ8T; are useless.\n- Cpt. ûvP? Wish\"\n\nThe recovery team faced a dilemma. They don't know if the water pipe flooded the room and if the storage survived it, so hacking the door lock could be a waste of time and resources. However, if they're not opening it, restoring the data would've been an even bigger waste. They considered their options for a bit and concluded, that opening it is the best option.\n\nThe technician did his job and a few moments later, the door stood wide open. The ponies used their flashlights and what they saw shocked them to the bones. The room was full of unused grenades, which could've gone off at any time during the past 200 years. Luckily, the water pipe was broken as the Captain predicted and flooded the room, making most of them useless. Only 50 - 70 were still intact."
TEN.26.a:0 "Could have been worse."

TEN.27.title:0 "Magical Weapon Prototype"
TEN.27.desc:0 "This one's definitely easier than the last one.\" The technician confidently restarted the terminal. He was still unsure if everything worked as intended, but at least he wasn't so nervous like the last time. His hopes became true and they had access to the file.\n\n\"Room 4, corridor 2a:\nAlright, I want that nopony, absolutely NOPONY, enters this room without my clear permission.

Lightning $¢°k\"\n\nThe ponies of the recovery team were excited. What was so special about that rifle, that even the MAS had to bring it to a different site? The technician didn't need to be told twice and in a possibly record-breaking speed, he opened the door.\n\nThe ponies stepped inside and were presented with a rather macabre scene. A rifle was placed on a table and around it were 5 or 6 half-melted skeletons. The rifle itself pointed towards a hole in the wall, which was about one meter in diameter, and contained a crystal that was bright enough to serve as a source of light. \n\nThe team didn't know how to proceed. One wrong move and they ended like the skeletons. But if they just leave it in the room, they risk that the rifle goes off eventually and no one knows what would happen then. They figured that it'd be the best to call their scientists and as it turned out, the rifle was too damaged to be used. But with proper analysis, we could replicate some parts for our own magical weapons, with better security measures of course, and have a good magical weapon."

TEN.28.title:0 "Computing Technology"
TEN.28.desc:0 "Ok, that should be it. This was more difficult than expected. Let's see if it works\", the technician rebooted the terminal and stepped back. For the last hour, he tried to restore the data, and if this didn't work, he wouldn't know what else he could do. Fortunately, he found the issue and saved the file.\n\n\"Room 2, corridor 2a:\nThe MAS is driving me crazy. Every other day, they're asking me 'Are you done yet?', 'When will you finish it?', Ëþà!ÎO³ They just don't understand the problem. If something is made by ponies, it can be beaten by ponies. And the encryption of terminals is no different pZ that. Anyways, I think we're close to a breakthrough, so maybe I can ýoTáÒf the deadline by a month.\n- Prof. Dr. Midnight Sparkle\"\n\nThe recovery team was excited. If the Prof. achieved his breakthrough before the mega spells dropped, it could be a large gain for our intelligence network. The technician opened the door and the ponies went inside. However, what they found was rather disappointing and only a few blueprints and idea concepts were inside. We'll give it to our IT team, perhaps they can use them somehow."

TEN.29.title:0 "The Secure Door"
TEN.29.desc:0 "Deep within Tenpony Tower, hidden behind several fake walls and magical illusions, resided a door. On the surface, it looked to be a very simple door, one made of wood with a cheap plastic handle. However, as the Twilight Society knew all too well, looks can be deceiving. \n \n What initially appeared to be a rather mundane door was in fact one of the most secure entryways within the entire tower. Physically, the wood was merely a facade for hard metal that made up the actual door. The handle did nothing, with the real unlocking mechanism being entirely arcane in nature. More wards were placed on it than the tower itself, protecting both the door and the room it guarded. The best minds of the Twilight Society spent weeks analyzing each and every spell placed upon this entryway, trying to discern any possible method of unlocking it. A breakthrough was had, and it was determined that it would accept only a vocal phrase from a select individual. And so, one of the younger members of the Society was tasked with playing holotape recordings of various high ranking M.A.S officials, including the Ministry Mare herself. After a week straight, the correct phrase was found."

Numerous security wards were dispelled, automated turrets were put offline, and a young inductee would be the first to witness what appeared to be an impossibly huge library. More senior members of the Twilight Society were quick to respond, and a formal expedition into this well-guarded room was hastily organized. \n \n Within a hour, every senior member of the Society was brought together. As one, they made their way into this great library that had been kept secure for so long. Every book was contained within plain binding, with no titles or other markings denoting their contents. The first theory to be thrown out was that these were copies of banned literature. Another theory was that these all contained knowledge better left forgotten, dark magic and horrible hexes that were too evil for the public to have access to. They all tensed as a less cautious member of their group pulled a tome off of one of the many shelves along the wall, opened its cover, and began to read. \n \n 'A Rainbow Romance, by Twilight Sparkle.' \n \n Upon further examination, every single one of the thousands of books contained within the room seemed to be along similar lines. A simple vote was held, and it was decided to reseal the room and forget it had ever existed."

Since the Lightbringer rescued them from the mad ghoul doctor, the talks of bringing them back into Tenpony Tower's sphere of influence dominated the Twilight Society's conversations. He knew from the beginning that it was just a matter of time before they made their move, and now his assumptions were confirmed.\n\nAs they walked in near complete silence, save for the clopping of their hooves against the cracked asphalt, the unicorn stallion frowned as the shabby-looking huts of the settlement appeared in their line of sight. After spending most of his life behind the safety of Tenpony's walls, any outside building seemed puny and irrelevant, but he - unlike most of the Tower residents - was perfectly aware that not everypony could afford luxury, and oftentimes it wasn't even their fault.\n\nIt then came as no surprise that he had been elected to represent the interests of the Society in contact with smaller settlements scattered around Manehattan, with Gutterville being the first on the list. If Tenpony were to grow and become stronger, they needed the trust of local ponies and who would do the job better than a simple wastelander's sympathiser?\n\nA grunt from one of his colleagues dragged him away from his thoughts. They were here. Starry Gaze stopped for a while, looking at the curious faces of local townsponies who noticed the newcomers. They all showed some degree of curiosity; some gave them distrustful looks. The unicorn finally sighed, fixed his clothing, and proceeded to try and find Gutterville's mayor."

So, it comes to no surprise that they would like to take our relationship to the next level. \n \n A delegate from Tenpony has arrived today, asking that we unite with them to a greater level. This would result in them being given power over us that they had previously lacked, and would mean that our people would be expected to help defend their assets and interests.

Trade flows across our little slice of the city, and business is booming like never before. \n \n And yet, it isn't all good news. Though the caps are trading hooves constantly, a disproportionate amount of them are finding their ways in the hooves of a few business barons.

Unfortunately, the dangers in the region have prevented them from actually being connected to said trade route before now. Raiders, wild animals, and petty gangs all infested the ruins and have harassed anypony who dared to move through that area. However, thanks to our efforts, the area has grown safe enough for our traders to finally take advantage of it. Marelem may enjoy being integrated into Manhattan's economy at last. "

TEN.46.title:0 "The Trade Barons"
TEN.46.desc:0 "It has been a concern of ours for a while that a select few ponies have rapidly grown to become richer than our tower itself. Their business empires practically own our economy, and the influence they wield within our territory is immense. Even more concerningly, not one of these 'Trade Barons' is a member of our Society. If action isn't taken soon, they could very well grow to become even more powerful than us, enough so to perhaps even steal Tenpony Tower itself from us. \n \n Unfortunately, any action we take against them will inevitably slow and damper our economy. And there's no real guarantee that they will seek any power over us. After all, shouldn't immense wealth be more than enough for them? The decision must then be made: do we work to limit their influence through regulating their businesses and restricting their expansion, or do we let them continue as is?"

Unfortunately, wealth has a tendency to attract some unsavoury types. Raiders, bandits, and simple highwayponies are all trying to set up shop along the route. Though our security forces have thus far been able to repel them, they have unfortunately taken some losses in the process. In order to help protect them, and to further deter any efforts to harass this line, we shall begin constructing fortifications along it. Sturdy walls, automated turrets, and tall towers shall all help us ensure its security. Should it ever come down to it, we will be able to defend it against even an army!"

Food, healing potions, and guns are all in short supply, with everything going towards the war effort. Even more concerningly however, we don't have anywhere near enough ponies to cover all of our land in the face of such an assault. If we want to win this war, we have no choice but to do the unthinkable: we must begin conscripting ponies. \n \n Understandably, many of our residents are opposed to the idea of being sent to die for us. The wealthy in particular feel that they have quite a lot to lose, and have instead come to us with an offer: they would be more than willing to fund the war effort, if we would refrain from conscripting them. Should we allow this arrangement, or is ponypower far more important?"

Tenpony Tower has sent us an offer to band together in these trying times, for our two cities to help defend the other against the pegasi invasion.

Rottingtail's ghouls imperil us all, and through your combined ignorance and cowardice, you have wrongly disgraced Chief Grim Star and his actions to save the Tenpony Tower. Thus, by arresting him, not only have you dishonored all loyal to him, but every pony that still fights to protect Tenpony..\"\n\n He glances at the surrounding Tenpony security, with most paying attention to the nooses hanging around the Society's necks.

However, I wish to affirm you all that the Twilight Society, the very traitors that have endangered you all, no longer pose a threat. It always was and will still forever be my duty to protect you all. The eradication of this corrupt society was absolutely paramount, with their threat to all of you being much more villainous than anypony could have realized. Their methods, backwards and secretive, would've placed the lives of every resident of Tenpony in peril. I, as your most trusted head of security, would not allow that, and you can rest assured that the Twilight Society no longer endangers the tower. \n\nInstead, I wish to continue by  proclaiming my ambitions to you all. The wastes that surround Tenpony are indeed much more unforgiving than our previous administration. They house the very villains that we fight to protect you from, and the monsters that threaten your lives. Your safety will forever be my priority, but my ulterior motive must be made clear. Manehattan, a city once cherished in Old Equestria, shall be united once more! United by a campaign waged by those who battle against tyranny and chaos! \n\nI will not lie, the unification of this region will be tenacious and difficult, but only through the combined effort out of every citizen and resident under Tenpony shall we accomplish this!

The papers he had spent so long using were organized neatly, as he attached them to a nearby clipboard and  stuffed the leftover drafts into a drawer. Roughly content with his work, Grim Star began to smirk in satisfaction, a rare sight to see as the brief moment of delight lapsed as he could hear steps from across the hall. \n\nA Tenpony official entered the room, an auburn stallion with a short, well-cut mane. He wore a high-ranking insignia on his uniform, indicating his high status in Tenpony's new cabinet and his connection to the Grim Star himself. Entering the office, he didn't inquire as to why he was summoned for long as he glanced at Grim Star's desk. Even compared to when he was only tasked with managing the security of the tower, this is the busiest the Chief had ever been, as the earth pony could well observe. \n\nGrim Star broke the assistant's thoughts by levitating the documents towards him, the auburn pony glancing at the large heading at the top of the page in surprise. \n\nTenpony will be getting its very first mandatory conscription."

TEN.78.title:0 "The Elites"
TEN.78.desc:0 "The new conscription draft of Tenpony Tower had been going considerably well. For the first time since Tenpony had opened its doors to the Wasteland, it had implemented a draft completely unfamiliar to its residents. Used to having hired guards loyal to not much else other than a bi-weekly payment, having a standing military would be a considerable change of pace for the military of Tenpony. The security offices would be turned into barrack rooms, and the locker rooms into varying armories. Tenpony's residents would finally have a military that could specialize in quantity as well as quality.\n\nNot everything was going as hoped, however. The draft may have accomplished its original goal of acquiring recruits, but the standing elites of the previous administration still elude our grasp. A newer, more concise conscription wave will commence: the main priority being the recruitment of the veterans who seek to laze in their cabins instead of serving in the front lines."
TEN.78.a:0 "Elites or not, you will help serve your tower."

TEN.79.title:0 "No Special Privileges"
TEN.79.desc:0 "The problem with being recognized as a 'veteran' is that you earn a status that would not fly under anyone else.\n\nThis is no different for the revamped military under Grim Star. The new draft, as successful as it was to swell our ranks with recruits, had been dodged by those who think themselves too worthy of serving in our military. Better yet, some of them have an elitism so haughty they don't bother hiding, but instead simply refuse to enlist in our ranks.\n\nThis elitism did not last long. Of the few remaining elites hiding in their homes, they were all dragged out and hauled to the barracks. Those who simply think themselves too highly to serve as "cannon-fodder" were forced through means that others would seem as quite brutish. But the Overstallion does not see a difference in these ponies. If they fit the criteria, they shall serve and fight for our tower."

The many recruits that fill our barracks, while plentiful in quantity, lack the quality that Grim Star needs for his ambitions.\n\nThe Overstallion wasted no time overhauling Tenpony's training. Entire regimens were overhauled and new ones introduced, with the less strict modules now improved to exemplify the harshness of true combat. Our guards, while relatively competent thanks to their veterancy in their posts, are now much more skilled and experienced as a result. Our officers, once far too haughty with the skills to barely compensate, now vigorously trained in leadership and tactical wits. Even the elites, who previously sought to dodge the draft and evade our front lines, are now eagerly honing their skills in our ranges, with some already putting their skills to good use as they practice against mutants outside Tenpony. \n\nOur military, once filled with mercenaries loyal only to those that could fill their pockets, now a proper force to be reckoned with across the entire Wasteland."

Obstinate and adamant, the unicorn inherits his qualities from his previous duties while serving under the Society. Now, he recognizes their feeble-minded goals that still endanger Tenpony, and wastes no time to let them bicker in whatever shadows they still claim. The execution of their leadership, while successful in calming the qualms of Tenpony, has not gotten rid of this organization just yet. Rather, it has only given them the time they may need to retake Tenpony for themselves. \n\nGrim Star wastes no time in letting this happen; as every last flame of the Twilight Society shall be extinguished."

Grim Star makes it clear that this newfound resistance has managed to spread into every corner of the tower's new administration, sprouting slowly from their shadows as they've managed to infiltrate our day-to-day operations. Some members of the resistance have integrated almost seamlessly, already spreading their influence to those naive enough to believe them and fall for their tricks, all underneath our noses. \n\nEradicating this resistance shall be swift, Grim Star claims, starting by uprooting the resistance from its exterior. While they have seemingly managed to implant dissidents into much of Tenpony's working residence, discerning one resident from another is a feat only manageable by Tenpony's security... \n\nand all it will take is a single night."

She was beaten, bruised, bloody, and had several rods of metal sticking out of her. So all in all, not the worst he'd seen that day. Satisfied with the results, he gently lifted her head so as to look her in the eye before speaking.\n\n'You know, it doesn't have to keep going. You can make this all stop, bring an end to the pain and suffering. At any time, if you just agree to cooperate, I will personally offer a full pardon to you and make sure you are given food and treatment.'\n\nAt first, she merely looked at him with the same defiance they all held. Yet as the seconds ticked by, this defiance rapidly crumbled in the face of her own plight. A minute passed. In a voice rendered hoarse by dehydration, she spoke. And Grim Star smiled."

This act of resistance would be one of the last, as each one of the rebels quickly fell, and the invading forces secured the room. Marching in, Grim Star surveyed the area before issuing his orders.\n\n'Grab everything you can. Papers, supplies, weapons, everything. I want it all secured in our armory before sunrise.'\n\nAs his soldiers moved to carry out his orders, he smiled. Though they may still resist him, this would be the definitive blow that would mark the end of the Twilight Society."

Yet they resisted and fought. Their ponies protested our rule, ambushed our patrols, and demanded their independence be returned. Such ungrateful behavior could not go unnoticed, nor could it go unpunished.\n\nWhen the ponies of Gutterville gathered for their daily protest, they were not met with the understaffed rookies that were usually assigned to patrol this part of town. Instead, they faced an organized mass of professionally armed and trained soldiers, proudly wearing the colors of Tenpony Tower. In spite of this, they continued as they usually would, shouting their calls for freedom to the air. Their protest would be interrupted by a single shot fired into the air, as a unicorn officer stepped out of the guards ranks and addressed the gathering.\n\n'Good ponies of Gutterville! Grim Star has extended his mercy to you, and is willing to give you this one chance to peacefully disperse. Return to your homes, and all will be forgiven.'\n\nSilence, before an empty Sparkle-Cola bottle came flying at the officers head. Ducking and retreating, he shouted the final words that many of those present would hear."

TEN.86.title:0 "The Bat Question"
TEN.86.desc:0 "One problem has plagued our fair tower for a while now: batponies. Those creatures of the night occupy Marelem, and have caused quite a stir among our ranks due to their many unusual qualities. Indeed, more than a few foals tales regarding how the evil bats will steal them away into the night if they don't behave had emerged. This of course has done little but alienate them, driving a wedge between Marelem's population and the rest of our ponies. Something had to be done, thus a meeting was called.\n\nThose gathered were in open debate, with all sorts of ideas being thrown at the wind. Diversity programs, forceful integration, or just segregation were all being put on the table. Grim Star didn't so much as consider any of these plans, merely watching as his high ranking officers debated and argued for several minutes before stepping in.\n\n'You are all fools and imbeciles. Diversity? Inclusion? You're lucky I don't have you all executed for such incompetent ideas! There is no room for such vile creatures in our nation. Here's what we're going to do'\n\nThe longer he talked, the more uncertain each of those present became. What he proposed was nothing short of mass murder, an atrocity far worse than anything they had carried out before. Grim Star's word was law though, and they were left with little choice but to carry out his plan."
TEN.86.a:0 "Goddesses forgive us for what we must do."

TEN.87.title:0 "The Barbarism of Ponykind"
TEN.87.desc:0 "When word of what Arbu had done hit Tenpony, it was understandably met with open revulsion. How could such a peaceful settlement turn out to be nothing more than undercover cannibals? How could anyone resort to such extremes, to consume their fellow pony? Such a horrific act was unthinkable to many across the tower, but that is precisely what had happened. In response to the situation, Grim Star gave a speech to the disgusted masses.\n\n'Hello, ponies of Tenpony and beyond. Many of you already know me, but for those who have not tuned in to our radio in a while, I am Chief Grim Star, leader and protector of Tenpony Tower. Recently, the vile ways of the small settlement of Arbu have come to light. Most who learned about it have responded with disgust, but I must confess that I was not surprised in the slightest. You see, when the world ended two centuries ago, so too did the ideals of good governance. And without a proper firm hoof guiding our nation, we have devolved rapidly into little more than animals. Raiders, cannibals, and worse are all to be expected from our kind when we exist in such a state. If we wish to return from this, to rebuild and be reborn from the ashes, we have no other choice than to enforce and maintain order. And this I promise you, Equestria: Under me, ponykind shall know true order, true civilization, once more. Tenpony Tower shall stand as a beacon of modernity amid a wasteland of primitive barbarism. For without strong leadership, we are doomed to devolve into little more than the cannibals of Arbu. Thank you.'"
TEN.87.a:0 "A great speech from a great stallion."

TEN.88.title:0 "Unbroken Steel"
TEN.88.desc:0 "While the Manehattan Steel Rangers may have officially surrendered to us, a large number of remnants have continued to resist us. We can't send a patrol through Bucklyn without it getting ambushed, and all efforts to dislodge them have thus far resulted in failure.\n\nOver the past few days, our scouts reported greatly increased activity through the ruins, with several large gatherings of Steel Rangers being identified. In light of this, Chief Grim Star ordered the fortification of Bucklyn Cross, anticipating a push by the remnants to regain control of their former base.\n\nIt seems Grim Star was unfortunately mistaken regarding the nature of their movements however. Rather than directly attempt a large push to retake their headquarters, they have instead opted to retake their former outposts. Outposts Raspberry and Caramel have both been retaken, with little resistance."
TEN.88.a:0 "Something needs to be done about this."

TEN.89.title:0 "Battle for Raspberry"
TEN.89.desc:0 "Before the War, Outpost Raspberry was little more than a police station. However, the local chapter of Steel Ranger's converted it into one of their outposts following their rise to power within the region. It has undergone a number of renovations since then, with it's walls all being fortified, and several watchposts being established in the ruins surrounding it.\n\nUnfortunately for us, this made a surprise assault near impossible. Our forces were left with little choice but to simply openly assault, using the ruins as rather lousy makeshift cover. It seems that this was far from desirable though, and we took heavy casualties from the approach alone.\n\nDespite this, our forces carried on, pushing into the police station proper and fighting against our power armored foe in close quarters. It was a bloodbath, and many wonder if it was truly worth it. In the end though, we managed to secure the outpost as our own, and delivered a serious blow to the remnants."
TEN.89.a:0 "A bitter victory."

TEN.90.title:0 "Battle for Caramel"
TEN.90.desc:0 "Caramel is the less fortified of the two outposts, being little more than a repurposed warehouse. Unfortunately, this warehouse stands alone, with few buildings or ruins in the area around it. As a result, our soldiers were left in the open, and were subject to constant barrages from the warehouse's rooftop. Despite this, they pushed onwards.\n\nTrying to push through either the loading bay or the front door would be suicide, so we made our own entrance. Explosive charges made quick work of the poorly maintained warehouse wall, allowing our soldiers to pour in and bypass many of the Steel Ranger's fortifications entirely. We still suffered heavy casualties, but the battle lasted little under an hour before the outpost was secured."
TEN.90.a:0 "Hopefully we can soon put this all behind us."

TEN.91.title:0 "The Cleansing of Arbu"
TEN.91.desc:0 "The orders that many had been awaiting finally came from up high: Deal with Arbu. A swift surprise attack was conducted, and the town was powerless to do much in it's own defence. Those few ponies who managed to scramble for a gun in time were rapidly taken out, as our forces fired indiscriminately at everything that moved. Once the screaming died down and no more ponies could be found, the town was razed to the ground.\n\nWith the destruction of the last house, Arbu was left as little more than a large pile of still-burning rubble and corpses. In time, the land would be resettled, and turned into a proper civilized settlement. For now though, it would serve as a grim reminder as to the sins of ponykind."
TEN.91.a:0 "They have felt the flames of justice."

TEN.92.title:0 "The Manehattan Project"
TEN.92.desc:0 "'For it is our duty to rebuild this great city! Two centuries now, it has lied in ruin, only degrading year after year. No longer! That changes, right here, right now! From this day onward, our efforts shall go towards rebuilding what was once the greatest city in all of Equestria, for the sake of not just our citizens, but for all of ponykind!'\n\nThe speech ended, as all of Grim Star's broadcasts did, with loud cheering and applause, followed by a brief patriotic tune from the War. However, this speech wasn't just talk. Already, orders had been issued and preparations had been made to work on restoring ruins all across the city. The so-called 'Manehattan Project' would be one of the largest undertakings Tenpony had ever conducted, with the goal of working towards making their city once again the greatest in the nation."
TEN.92.a:0 "That sounds like a lot of work."

TEN.93.title:0 "The Orangedale Miracle"
TEN.93.desc:0 "Orangedale was once little more than a den of savagery, full of raiders and other scum. Now though, it stood as a shining example of Grim Star's speeches made real, a beacon of civilization and prosperity for the entire world to look at and admire. What was once a bloody arena had become a bustling marketplace, the various chem dens had become proper living areas and establishments, and the heads on spikes had all been replaced with flags that waved proudly in the breeze. Overlooking it all were proper guards, who looked out for any sign of trouble and put a swift end to anyone that sought to disturb the peace."
TEN.93.a:0 "There is hope for Manehattan after all."

TEN.94.title:0 "The Secrets of Power Armor"
TEN.94.desc:0 "Though our war against the Steel Rangers was costly, our victory has brought with it many benefits. Beyond just our new land and resources, we have also managed to secure a large stash of power armor in the depths of Bucklyn Cross. It seems that the armor was deemed unfit to wear by the Steel Rangers, as many of the suits are in states of disrepair. However, we have far fewer reservations than they did and are more than glad to put the armor to use\n\nIn even better news, we believe we could replicate the armor now that we have so many suits in our possession. It won't be the best protection in the world, and it won't compare well against proper power armor, but it's more than enough for us to create dedicated units of heavily armored security personnel."
TEN.94.a:0 "Won't that armor be awful heavy?"

TEN.95.title:0 "A Bright Future"
TEN.95.desc:0 "Speeches from Grim Star had become increasingly more common as his dream became more and more of a reality. It has become normal to the many residents of Tenpony, and even the residents of Manehattan. After all, he made sure that his voice was broadcast as loud and as far as possible. Today however, his speech was much different.\n\nThe immediately noticeable change was the music. Whereas his speeches would normally begin with just him, today it began with a cheery and patriotic tune. The song played briefly, before being replaced with another voice announcing the arrival of Chief Grim Star, followed by the standard cheering and applause. After all this fanfare, the stallion himself came on air.\n\n'Hello, citizens of Tenpony and beyond! I am here today to proudly announce that the era of savagery and war that we have known for so long is finally coming to an end. Thanks to the efforts of the brave mares and stallions of Tenpony, the Equestrian Wasteland has finally been allowed a glimpse of peace. Vile raiders, hideous creatures, and warlike remnants alike have all met us in battle, and they have all fallen before our bullets. How, you may ask, have we survived such odds? How have we overcome such challenges? \n\nThat is simple. We have a just cause, a noble cause, while our enemy had little more than their own selfishness to drive them. Our valiant forces did not fight just for their own lives, nor even for their homes. They fought for something far greater, for ponykind as a whole. With this drive, with this dedication, they persevered in the face of adversity, time and time again.\n\nNow we stand as the greatest beacon of prosperity that our world has known in 200 years. All thanks to the sacrifices and efforts of those who fought for a greater cause. In honor of them, and in honor of all who have helped make this dream a reality, I am officially announcing that the city of Manehattan is no more. Such an old name was rendered meaningless long ago, when our nation was reduced to little more than rubble and ash. We are no longer Manehattan. From now on, it shall be known as the city of Tenpony!'"
TEN.95.a:0 "Long live Grim Star! Long live Tenpony!"

TEN.96.title:0 "An Intriguing Discovery"
TEN.96.desc:0 "As Tenpony's soldiers scour the tower in ever greater numbers, reports of the guards' discoveries from their patrols are rather infrequent. Most only tell findings of hidden Society stashes or passageways a guard may stumble upon, although one particular report handed in was deemed much more significant than the others.\n\n It indicated that while patrolling through the library as per routine, one keen guard had encountered what seemed to be a hidden mechanism, blending with the rest of the library. Such a mechanism was most likely intentionally hidden, cleverly made to merge seamlessly into the scenery as its camouflage had kept it hidden from Tenpony so far.\n\n The mechanism, when triggered, reveals an entirely new section of the library that previously lied hidden and inaccessible. It no doubt holds knowledge the Society had hoped to forever keep secret."
TEN.96.a:0 "The Society thought they could keep their knowledge a secret."
