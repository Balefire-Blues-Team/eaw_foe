TEN.1.title:0 "The MAS hub"
TEN.1.desc:0 "Tenpony Tower. A luxury hotel, known for housing the Ministry of Arcane Science's Manehatten Hub. When Balefire began raining from the sky, those ponies working within the Hub were some of the first to know. Orders came in from Canterlot to fire the prototype megaspell Celestia One at Roam, capital of the Zebra empire. Knowing that Manehatten would be a primary target, the ponies of the Ministry had to make a choice. They could follow their orders and focus on casting the megaspell, or ignore their orders and focus on using the Manehatten Emergency Broadcasting System to warn the residents of the city. There wouldn't be enough time to do both, and the seconds were ticking down."
TEN.1.a:0 "Sound the Emergency Broadcast System"
TEN.1.b:0 "Fire Celestia One!"

TEN.2.title:0 "Walls of Balefire"
TEN.2.desc:0 "Tenpony Tower was able to survive the wrath of the Balefire bombs thanks to a series of thick steel walls that coat the MAS hub, unfortunately it was still heavily damaged with the outer walls ripped apart and not a single window survived the shockwave. Soon after irradiated air seeped into the tower. A group of volunteers had requested that they take their protective suits from their labs and go out to repair and fortify the outer walls. Another group had proposed that they’d leave the outer walls to be used as a trap for Ghouls and other abominations and instead focused on fortifying the still functional inner walls."
TEN.2.a:0 "Repair the outer wall"
TEN.2.b:0 "Fortify the inner walls"

TEN.3.title:0 "Outside Communication"
TEN.3.desc:0 "The years following the Balefire were harsh, even to the relatively lucky occupants of Tenpony Tower. The Tower was never stocked to be a long-term survival shelter, and the M.A.S.'s emergency provisions would only last so long. As a result, the ponies within rapidly found themselves running out of food and supplies alike. So, the moment the radiation levels outside were deemed "acceptable", a scavenging expedition was launched to obtain crucial supplies. However, the ponies of this expedition quickly found that they were not the only ones within the devastated ruins of Manehatten. They found a nearby settlement, built with scrap on top of old ruins. Upon getting closer to the settlement, they were shocked to find it full of the undead! The expedition backed away and considered their options. They could attempt to approach these things and see if they were willing to trade. Alternatively, they put an end to these abominations and take all they have. After all, what need do the dead have for food?"
TEN.3.a:0 "Try approaching the zombies."
TEN.3.b:0 "Make the dead stay dead."

TEN.4.title:0 "Ghoul Problem"
TEN.4.desc:0 "Life in our tower was very serene, safe and calm (for those who had the caps), but it seems that peace can come to an end. One of our major Wasteland product suppliers has provided us with valuable information regarding the ghoul population in Manehattan. Namely, about a large settlement of zombies near our tower. It's amazing how they have not attacked us yet, given the carelessness and the unreadiness of our guard to defend against massive enemy groups. Let it be just ghouls, but the problem of their unwanted neighborhood next to us needs a solution. To begin with, first of all, a worthy intelligence is required to be one hundred percent sure that this is reliable information, and at the same time, to find out how many ghouls can potentially attack us."
TEN.4.a:0 "Send out some of our Officers to investigate"

TEN.5.title:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
TEN.5.desc:0 "Grim Star sat in his office, pondering what he heard. A huge accumulation of ghouls by the standards of the wasteland. Let them be more or less reasonable, their leader was clearly close to becoming feral. The unicorn did not see a way out of the situation, except to conclude a contract with Blackwing's Talons, hoping that they would restrain the onslaught in the event of an attack. Or help deliver a preemptive strike. While smoking a smoldering cigarette, he turned his gaze out the window, looking at the ruins of skyscrapers, cracked paved highways and the rusted remains of the Celestia line. He decided to secretly hire a band of griffins, so as not to incur the wrath of his superiors, who are forever against widespread cooperation with the outside world. And who are against paying Talons to do the dirty work. Grim Star is not afraid of possible anger from the Twilight Society, or to spend a lot of his own caps. He sees the meaning of his existence only in that Tenpony stood forever, being the beacon of civilization in the Wasteland of Equestria, and saw the only way out of this situation only in mercenaries. And so, throwing away the cigarette butt as it burned his lips , he decided."
TEN.5.a:0 "Grim Star concludes a contract with Blackwing and her mercenaries"
TEN.5.b:0 "The Twilight Society stops Grim Star."

TEN.6.title:0 "The Star fell and crashed"
TEN.6.desc:0 "What was I hoping for? What would they praise me for, or would they pat me on the head with a hoof?" — Grim Star mentally scrolled in his head the events of the contract, thinking who could know about it. Everything went wrong at the last moment. As soon as he left the meeting place with Blackwing's talons, a security guard twisted it and reported the incident to the Twilight Society, in hopes of taking the place of Grim Star as Head of Security. The Society confined themselves not to expulse Grim Star from the Tower, but only to temporary arrest, and the deprivation of his post. However, Grim Star did not feel betrayed. He has done his duty as conscientiously as possible, concluding a contract with the Talons, which is very necessary for the weakened guard of the Tower. Now, he could sleep peacefully, knowing that his work was not wasted, let no one thank him."
TEN.6.a:0 "He will learn to consult the Society next time."

TEN.7.title:0 "Ghouls slaughtered"
TEN.7.desc:0 "Grim Star has hired Blackwing's talons to take out the Ghoul Sherrif Rottingtail who is slowly going mad. Blackwing's talons tried taking out Rottingtail quietly but it failed and the ghouls attack Blackwing's talons. Forcing them to take out all the ghouls. "
TEN.7.a:0 ""

TEN.8.title:0 "DJ Pon3's Broadcast"
TEN.8.desc:0 "\"Got your ears up, faithful listeners? Cuz I’ve been talkin’ and some of you ain’t been listenin’. For years now, I’ve been reminding you that ghouls and zombies ain’t the same thing. Ghouls are ponies who have had the misfortune of soaking up a major dose of magical radiation and not dying. That stuff twists and rots their bodies, but unlike zombies, their minds are still like those of any other pony, and they deserve t’ be treated as such.\"\n\n\"Well, some of you ponies up in Tenpony Tower didn’t get the message. And when Sheriff Rottingtail kept pressin’ for him and his ghouls t’ be allowed inside, just cuz they were sick of being hounded by manticores an’ slaughtered by bloodwings, Chief Grim Star, the head of Tenpony security, responded by hiring a bunch of mercenaries to scour the tenements along the Celestia Line and wipe them all out.\"\n\n\"In an interview, when asked how he had managed to be such a supreme douche bag, Chief Grim Star had this to say:\"\n\nAnother voice, gruff and irritated, came through the radio’s speakers. \"Fuck off. I did what was right by those I swore to protect.\"\n\nDJ Pon3’s voice returned. \"Just warms the heart to know that there are ponies steadfastly defending prejudice and bigotry, doesn’t it? Thank you, Chief Grim Star and may Celestia bless you with a kiss from the sun.\" The last certainly sounded like it was said through gritted teeth."
TEN.8.a:0 ""

TEN.9.title:0 "Returning Officers"
TEN.9.desc:0 "The security officers returned from their reconnaissance. Unfortunately they were discovered by the zombies and one died as he fought them valiantly head on, giving his fellow officers time to escape. A full report of the investigation has been delivered on Grim Star's desk."
TEN.9.a:0 "We will honour our fallen comrade when all of this is over."
