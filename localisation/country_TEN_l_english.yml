### Opening Focuses ###
TEN_ministry_hub:0 "The MAS Ministry Hub"
TEN_ministry_hub_desc:0 "The Manehattan Hub of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences was at the center of all of their operations within the Manehattan region. The building it was located in, known as Tenpony Tower, also served as a civilian hotel, which was used as a front for the Hub itself."

TEN_the_war:0 "The Damaged Tower"
TEN_the_war_desc:0 "Despite the various reinforcements and magical wards placed on Tenpony Tower, the building still suffered substantial damage during the end of the world. While much of this damage has been repaired over the past couple of centuries, some scars still remain."

TEN_communication:0 "Outside Communications"
TEN_communication_desc:0 "The residents of Tenpony couldn't just hide away in their tower forever. Eventually, they had to venture out into the ruins of Manehattan, where various dangers and horrors awaited them."

### The Library ###
TEN_library:0 "Twilight Sparkle's Athenaeum"
TEN_library_desc:0 "Twilight Sparkle was a known collector and preserver of books. Just about every MAS Hub was home to at least one stash of books, and our own holds much more than one."

TEN_Banned_section:0 "Banned Section"
TEN_Banned_section_desc:0 "Among Twilight's books were many relating to waging war. While these books won't be available to the general public, they will be very useful in training our security forces."

TEN_Unicorn_tech:0 "Lethal Unicorn Spells"
TEN_Unicorn_tech_desc:0 "Basic combat spells are common across the Wasteland. However, more complex spells have been all but forgotten since the end of the War. Fortunately for us, we are now in possession of several books on just that topic."

TEN_weapon_tech:0 "Prototype Weapon Blueprints"
TEN_weapon_tech_desc:0 "The Ministry Mare was dedicated to preserving knowledge in all of its forms. To our surprise, this also included things such as schematics and blueprints, most notably relating to various weaponry."

TEN_military_section:0 "Military Tactic Section"
TEN_military_section_desc:0 "Military history has been all but lost to the recesses of time. Until now, that is. Armed with the knowledge of hundreds of defeats and victories from battles from the far past, we can effectively analyze and improve upon our own strategies."

TEN_army_doctrine:0 "Army Tactics"
TEN_army_doctrine_desc:0 "Armies form the foundation of any successful military. From Equestria's armies during the Great War, to the ancient armies of the Griffonian Empire, there are many we can learn from regarding how to most effectively use our infantry."

TEN_navy_doctrine:0 "Naval Tactics"
TEN_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "The Equestrian Navy was once the mightiest force to sail the seas. They had the largest fleets, the most advanced ships, and the most developed doctrines. We could do well to learn from it."

TEN_air_doctrine:0 "Air Tactics"
TEN_air_doctrine_desc:0 "The idea of air domination was not invented during the Great War. To the contrary, the idea had been around for as long as races capable of flight have existed. Though we may not have wings, we can still study the tactics and methods of the pegasi and griffons in order to develop our own air doctrines."

TEN_public_section:0 "Public Library"
TEN_public_section_desc:0 "Many of the books that we have now freely shared with the public could be very useful in our own pursuits. Engineering, mathematics, arcane theory, and all other manners of knowledge could be very useful indeed."

TEN_robotics_section:0 "Robotic Section"
TEN_robotics_section_desc:0 "Robotics was a relatively new field within wartime Equestria. Reviving this field could be the key to revolutionizing our army and industry alike. "

TEN_industry_section:0 "Industrial Section"
TEN_industry_section_desc:0 "Equestria was undergoing an industrial revolution during the War. Rapid advancements allowed for production on a scale only dreamed of in the past. By learning from their production methods, we could unlock the secrets of mass production."

TEN_engineering_section:0 "Engineering Section"
TEN_engineering_section_desc:0 "Engineering is an art thought long lost. With the knowledge we have now, we could revive the field as a whole. Electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineering alike can be revived in the Wasteland. We even have books on environmental engineering!"

TEN_ideology_books:0 "Ideological Books"
TEN_ideology_books_desc:0 "The Ministry Mare hated to see any books destroyed, even those containing seditious material. She made an effort to preserve these books, and was rumored to have received a copy of each book destroyed by the Ministry of Image. Now, this leaves us with many of those books deemed too dangerous to be available to the public."

TEN_burn_books:0 "Burn the Books!"
TEN_burn_books_desc:0 "We can not allow such seditious ideas to poison the minds of our ponies! Just as the Ministry of Image did during the War, we shall censor and destroy that knowledge which poses a threat to our way of being."

TEN_Release_books:0 "Release the Books"
TEN_Release_books_desc:0 "Knowledge should be shared freely, regardless of whether or not it agrees with our worldview. While some ponies could begin to advocate for radical ideals, that is a risk we must take in our dedication to preserving knowledge."

TEN_ghoul_problem:0 "Ghoul Problem"
TEN_ghoul_problem_desc:0 "There's a group of ghouls who have been causing trouble for us as of late. They'll need to be dealt with, in one way or another."

TEN_hire_mercenaries:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
TEN_hire_mercenaries_desc:0 "The Twilight Society is hesitant to take action against the ghouls. Chief Grim Star has realized that he must go around them if he wishes to render the ghouls a non-issue."

TEN_founding_OWS_division:0 "Founding the OWS division"
TEN_founding_OWS_division_desc:0 ""

TEN_industry_research:0 "Strengthen Our Industry"
TEN_industry_research_desc:0 "Being confined to the resources and the intrinsic limits of just one building, however grand, would have some logistical drawback. However, our current industrial base leaves much to be desired. We must adapt to the Wastelands and develop a powerful industry to rival even the strongest of nations if we are to have any hope in this blasted place."

TEN_construction_research:0 "Innovative Construction Methods Begins Here"
TEN_construction_research_desc:0 "Before the Megaspells detonated, Twilight Sparkle, peace be upon the Ministry Mare, had smuggled in a vast quantity of books and designs from all over Equestria. We sit upon a veritable treasure trove of pre-war tech and pre-war knowledge that we could build upon. We had never lacked for talent here at Tenpony Towers, if we put our greatest minds to it, then surely we can develop construction capabilities that others can only dream of."

TEN_electronics_research:0 "Reverse-Engineer the Mysteries of Electronics"
TEN_electronics_research_desc:0 "So much knowledge had been lost over the centuries since the ashes had settled. There are still parts of this tower that remains a mystery to us, and ignorance of valuable knowledge can no longer be tolerated. We can and we must find out how those electronics and arcano-tech are intended to function and manufacture them. If possible, we might even be able to mass-produce some of them, thereby giving us a crucial advantage over all others."

TEN_exploitation_research:0 "Find the Treasures Deep Below"
TEN_exploitation_research_desc:0 "We are in need of resources. It would be for the best if we uncover more methods to find precious resources deep in the ground and help exploit them to enrich Tenpony Towers. Direct all to work towards research on the exploitation and extraction of precious resources."

TEN_fund_OWD_division:0 "Fund the OWD division"
TEN_fund_OWD_division_desc:0 "The OWD division cannot do what we demand of them without funding. It is a priority to secure their funding and provide them with all that they need to do their jobs."

TEN_coop_robot_research:0 "OWS-OWS Robot Research"
TEN_coop_robot_research_desc:0 "Robotic has always been a fruitful venture that we can explore. It remains an endeavour that we can undertake with some guarantee of success, and that's all that matters."

TEN_special_force_research:0 "Push Our Elites Forces To The Top"
TEN_special_force_research_desc:0 "Our Special Forces are always in need of better equipment, better methods, better training, and better doctrines. We shall make sure they are truly an unmatched power on the battlefield."

TEN_support_research:0 "Strengthen Our Auxillaries"
TEN_support_research_desc:0 "Support companies are the backbone to any proper security force that wish contest the Wastelands. They must be prioritised and given special attention."

TEN_naval_research:0 "Master the Rivers and the Seas"
TEN_naval_research_desc:0 "Of all the Rivers and the Seas, our ships will reign supreme."

TEN_aircraft_research:0 "Reach Ever Skyward"
TEN_aircraft_research_desc:0 "Our destiny lies not with the seas and the water, but that of the skies above. Should we master the skies, we shall overcome and reach ever greater heights than previously dreamed of."

TEN_new_members_desc:0 "A note in your pocket, a meeting in the dead of night. You decide to attend."

TEN_council_meeting_desc:0 "It's time for the Council to meet and decide what to do moving forward."

TEN_organize_celebration:0 "Organize a Celebration"
TEN_organize_celebration_desc:0 "To celebrate our great tower and to lift the spirits of our residents, we shall hold a grand celebration. There will be fine wines, finer cheeses, and ballroom dancing. It'll be a jolly good time! However, quite a lot of planning must go into such a grand event."

TEN_party_debat:0 "Party Budget Debate"
TEN_party_debat_desc:0 "Some within the Council have raised concerns regarding the planned budget for the celebration. Many believe our money would be better spent elsewhere, but others argue that we should spare no expense to make this the greatest party Manehattan has seen since before the War."

TEN_military_budget:0 "Discuss Military Budget Cuts"
TEN_military_budget_desc:0 "While the security and safety of our residents is always of utmost concern, the question must be raised if it is really necessary to be ready to fight a war at all times. Perhaps the security budget could be shifted towards more important matters, like our party?"

TEN_inspect_renovation:0 "Inspect Mall Renovation"
TEN_inspect_renovation_desc:0 "The Mall must be renovated if it is to serve as the grandest trading hub of all of Manehattan! We shall oversee this process to ensure that it is the height of opulence."

TEN_secret_chambers:0 "The Secret Chambers"
TEN_secret_chambers_desc:0 "Somepony once said, \"I wish Tenpony Tower was just half the size and fully explored.\" And frankly - he's right. Not a month goes by that we don't receive reports of ponies who stumble across unknown rooms with sometimes unknown creatures as well. However, a recent discovery showed that, with a bit of luck, one can find true gold mines."

TEN_unusual_find_desc:0 "Deep within the Hub resides a door with more wards and security than anywhere else within the entire tower. Who knows what could be behind it?"

TEN_real_society:0 "The Twilight Society"
TEN_real_society_desc:0 "The Twilight Society is the secretive ruling council of Tenpony. Though the public believes that the Tenpony Administration is in charge, they are little more than a front for the Twilight Society itself. They have ruled the tower since the War ended, and consider themselves the successors to the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. "

TEN_protect_celestia_line:0 "Protect the Celestia Line"
TEN_protect_celestia_line_desc:0 "Manehattan's Celestia Line offers both a valuable trade route and an easy method to travel across the city. We must secure, protect, and maintain it if we wish to put it to use."

TEN_gutterville_scrap:0 "Gutterville Scrap"
TEN_gutterville_scrap_desc:0 "Gutterville is a small settlement of scavengers struggling to get by in the ruins of Manehattan. While they may be a bit less civilized than our own residents, they know the city like the back of their hooves. By working with them, we can find all sorts of usable material."

TEN_economy_issue:0 "Dwindling Financial Budget"
TEN_economy_issue_desc:0 "Our economy is very import based. Right now, everything works fine, but what if our trade partners turn against us, or get conquered by someone who doesn't have our best in mind? Keeping our current course is too much of a risk and we need to be more self-sustaining."

TEN_import_prewar_food:0 "Import Cheap Pre-war food"
TEN_import_prewar_food_desc:0 "Despite being hundreds of years old, most pre-war Equestrian food is still edible. And even though it tastes like it as well, it's cheap and it has all the nutrients a pony needs."

TEN_import_meat_Arbu:0 "Import Radigator Meat From Arbu"
TEN_import_meat_Arbu_desc:0 "The small town of Arbu is well-known for its Radigator meat. It is said to be fresh, healthy, and delicious, even though it tastes a bit weird sometimes. It may not be our cheapest food source, but it's definitely better than that old pre-war food."

TEN_restaurant_recipes:0 "Restaurant Recipes"
TEN_restaurant_recipes_desc:0 "Due to the rising complaints about the meals tasting worse than, I quote, "my dead grandmother's hooves", our chefs desperately looked for a way to please the ponies, while keeping the food still cheap. Luckily, they found a few cookbooks, and their meals taste like nothing now, which is an improvement."

TEN_elite_cuisine:0 "Elite Cuisine"
TEN_elite_cuisine_desc:0 "In the past months, our best chefs tried every possibility, to make the already great Radigator meat even more delicious. After countless nights of experiments with all sorts of ingredients, they have gathered dozens of recipes, and our cuisine is known throughout the entire wasteland, for its manifold ways of preparing the precious meat. "

TEN_support_local_merchants:0 "Support Local Merchants"
TEN_support_local_merchants_desc:0 "We have finally solved our food problem. The main reason why we had to deal with it in the first place was that we were relying too much on foreign countries. It's only reasonable that we support domestic businesses over foreign ones."

TEN_attract_foreign_merchants:0 "Attract Foreign Merchants"
TEN_attract_foreign_merchants_desc:0 "We have finally secured a stable and reliable food source, and by attracting foreign merchants, we could get a nice little bonus. Some fear that we will rely on imports again, but this time, we have a food source to keep us alive in times of need."

TEN_military_contracts:0 "Sign Military Contracts"
TEN_military_contracts_desc:0 "A worker is useless if he has no factory to work in in the first place. Luckily, some foreign gunsmiths and companies have shown interest in us, and they are willing to invest in building a factory."

TEN_increase_wages:0 "Increase Worker Wages"
TEN_increase_wages_desc:0 "A worker does not work because of his loyalty to Tenpony, but rather because of the money we pay him. This means, that if we pay him badly, he works less and eventually moves to a place with higher wages. So why not give the workers a little pay rise, to show them our appreciation?"

TEN_recovering_economy:0 "Recovering Economy"
TEN_recovering_economy_desc:0 "After months and months of hard work, we not only got our economy back on track, but we have become a major power as well. We can finally move on to spread our sphere of influence and compete with the rest of the wasteland."

TEN_contact_gutterville_settlement:0 "Make Contact with Gutterville"
TEN_contact_gutterville_settlement_desc:0 "While we've already begun cooperating with the residents of Gutterville, we have neglected to contact their leadership thus far. In the interest of furthering our involvement with their settlement, it would do us well to send an envoy to whoever they consider their leader."

TEN_guard_gutterville:0 "Guard Gutterville"
TEN_guard_gutterville_desc:0 "Gutterville has been plagued by nothing but trouble throughout its entire history. Raiders, manticores, rogue spritebots, and more have constantly threatened the residents of the shantytown. We shall send our own security forces to protect their town, and keep their residents safe from all that would threaten them."

TEN_clear_MoM_hub:0 "Clear the MoM Hub"
TEN_clear_MoM_hub_desc:0 "The Ministry of Morale's Hub is the source of the seemingly endless swarm of spritebots that have relentlessly attacked Gutterville since it was first founded. The rogue robots seem to be stuck on their security protocols, and are very aggressively carrying out their duties. If we wish to get at what's inside the Hub, we must first begin by wiping out the machines that guard it."

TEN_scavenge_MoM:0 "Scavenge the MoM Hub"
TEN_scavenge_MoM_desc:0 "There surely must be more robots where the ones we destroyed came from. Stored inside the MoM hub, inactive, and waiting to be used one day. It would be a miracle if these didn't work anymore, and by selling all their different parts, we could make a small fortune."

TEN_fortify_MoM:0 "Fortify the MoM Hub"
TEN_fortify_MoM_desc:0 "There surely must be more robots where the ones we destroyed came from. So it's maybe not the worst idea to keep them locked inside of the MoM hub for good. The hub is a large building, so instead of scavenging what's inside, we should spend our few resources on turning it into a huge fortress."

TEN_form_MTC:0 "Form the MTC"
TEN_form_MTC_desc:0 "We have finally secured the situation on the 'home front', as the pre-war Equestrians said, and we are now in a position to expand our sphere of influence. We have already expanded our grasp on our neighbors, so they would be a good start."

TEN_invite_Gutterville:0 "Invite Gutterville"
TEN_invite_Gutterville_desc:0 "We have assisted Gutterville greatly in the past, and it's now time that they give us something in return. We already have enough soldiers and equipment, but what we do lack is an ally."

TEN_Gutterville_workposts:0 "Set Up Scavenger Workposts"
TEN_Gutterville_workposts_desc:0 "The scavengers of Gutterville may be experienced, but they are also largely disorganized. By organizing them into work units and creating a system for choosing which ruins to scavenge, we can greatly increase their efficiency."

TEN_tackle_manticores:0 "Tackle Manticore Problem"
TEN_tackle_manticores_desc:0 "Manticore's have been a persistent problem within Manehattan. It's about time that we find their breeding grounds so we can deal with them once and for all."

TEN_help_marelem:0 "Send Help to Marelem"
TEN_help_marelem_desc:0 "Our western neighbor, Marelem, is about as large as us, but much weaker. In fact, they are so weak, that they can't even defend themselves against the Manehattan Raiders. We, however, have the means to help them and it would be unfair if we didn't. Perhaps we can profit from it too."

TEN_protect_marelem:0 "Protect Marelem"
TEN_protect_marelem_desc:0 "Those raiders are tougher than we expected. However, they've only faced the small garrison we've stationed at Marelem thus far. It's time we show them our full force."

TEN_boost_marelem:0 "Boost Marelem's Economy"
TEN_boost_marelem_desc:0 "Due to those raiders, Marelem was never able to build up a proper industry, since every new factory would have been immediately destroyed. However, the Manehattan Raiders have been repelled, and with some financial incentive, Marelem's ponies can finally experience what civilization looks like."

TEN_deal_with_MRA:0 "Deal With the Manehattan Raiders"
TEN_deal_with_MRA_desc:0 "It's time we finally deal with those raiders once and for all. For far too long, we've been trying to cast them out of our lands, and it's starting to get embarrassing. A final demonstration of force should show the Wasteland that we can handle a few raiders with ease."

TEN_raiderwar_aftermath:0 "Aftermath of the Raider War"
TEN_raiderwar_aftermath_desc:0 "The land we have taken from the raiders is practically useless. Endless, barren, and sparsely inhabited ruins and wastes with no proper use for us. By giving one or two provinces to our little ally, it would provide the perfect opportunity for them to prove themselves, wouldn't it?"

TEN_invite_marelem:0 "Invite Marelem"
TEN_invite_marelem_desc:0 "While Marelem is practically under our protection, we never signed any form of a formal agreement. Surely, the good ponies of Marelem would never refuse such a treaty, considering all the benefits they would receive by staying with us. And if they think they don't need our help, then that's fine by us too."

TEN_fetlock_autonomy:0 "Give Fetlock Some Autonomy"
TEN_fetlock_autonomy_desc:0 "The little town of Fetlock has shown to be a little problem recently. Apparently, its citizens see us as oppressors and some even started to violently revolt against our rule. Fetlock isn't really worth fighting for, so why not accommodate those rebels a bit and give them some formal autonomy?"

TEN_create_neutral_zone:0 "Create The Manehattan Scavenger Zone"
TEN_create_neutral_zone_desc:0 "Frankly, we don't have any need for most of the land west of Tenpony. We have invested so many resources into guarding it and have gotten almost nothing from that barren land in return. Luckily, [MAR.GetLeader] is able and willing to rule that land, so why not let him do it for us?"

TEN_loot_raider_base:0 "Loot the Orangedale armory"
TEN_loot_raider_base_desc:0 "The Manehattan Raider's might have been a bunch of uncivilized barbarians, but they sure had one hell of an armory. An armory that is now ours."

TEN_settle_orangedale:0 "Settle Orangedale"
TEN_settle_orangedale_desc:0 "Orangedale was one of the most notorious raider dens in Manehattan, being a center for all sorts of raider activities. Chems were traded freely, slaves were marched through the streets, and we're told that the arena was the height of entertainment. That kind of filth is of course not welcome in our nation. However, we can still restore the settlement as a beacon of proper civilization."

TEN_scavenge_program:0 "Set up Scavenge Programs"
TEN_scavenge_program_desc:0 "The ruins of Manehattan are plentiful in resources, if we know where to look. We will establish a scavenging program to find those jewels within the sea of rubble, that may then be put to good use."

TEN_orangedale_construction:0 "Orangedale Construction Company"
TEN_orangedale_construction_desc:0 "You can hardly tell that Orangedale was once a raider settlement. The graffiti is gone, the gore has been cleaned up, and only a few empty syringes still litter the ground. With its newfound civilization has come a newfound economy, and it is rapidly becoming a prosperous trading hub. To help it along this path, we will provide funding for the establishment of a proper construction company, which may help them build a proper town out of the ruins."

TEN_new_Opportunities:0 "New Opportunities"
TEN_new_Opportunities_desc:0 "The civilizing of Manehattan has brought with it a variety of benefits, among those being the new markets for our fine businessponies."

TEN_expand_Gutterville:0 "Expand Business to Gutterville"
TEN_expand_Gutterville_desc:0 "Gutterville was a poor hovel full of poorer ponies. That is, until we civilized it. Now the ponies of Gutterville are enjoying protection, trade, and prosperity. Making them an ideal target for our own economic expansion."

TEN_gutterville_armorshop:0 "Gutterville Armorshop"
TEN_gutterville_armorshop_desc:0 "Armor is a necessity within the Wasteland. Without it, your chances of survival decrease drastically. Unfortunately, the armor market is far from prosperous. To help resolve this, we'll help establish proper armor production and sales within Gutterville."

TEN_gutterville_materials:0 "Gutterville Materials"
TEN_gutterville_materials_desc:0 "The ruins around Gutterville are full of scrap metal, concrete, and other useful materials. The mighty towers of Manehattan were once built from these materials, and soon they shall be rebuilt with the very same. To help facilitate this, we shall establish a company within the settlement dedicated entirely to using these scavenged materials for construction."

TEN_expand_marelem:0 "Expand Business to Marelem"
TEN_expand_marelem_desc:0 "Marelem has been civilized. The raiders that once plagued them are no more, and their ponies living standards are rapidly improving. More importantly though, a new market has opened for us."

TEN_marelem_bar:0 "The Marelem Entertainment District"
TEN_marelem_bar_desc:0 "The less civilized ponies who come through our territory and even our tower unfortunately have far less refined tastes than our great residents. Though we would never sink so low as to appease such lesser desires within our tower itself, some of our more innovative businessponies have come up with a solution. A large portion of Marlem may be designated as an 'entertainment district', where those businesses that usually would not be accepted are allowed to flourish. It will include all sorts of ruffian interests, such as blackjack and hard liquor."

TEN_nonlethal_bullet_factory:0 "Non-lethal Bullet Factory"
TEN_nonlethal_bullet_factory_desc:0 "Most of our security within the tower itself use rubber ammunition and aim to arrest rather than kill any troublemakers. Unfortunately, our entire supply of these bullets comes from the Great War, and our supply is beginning to run low. In order to solve this issue, we will begin manufacturing our own."

TEN_trade_barons:0 "The Trade Barons"
TEN_trade_barons_desc:0 "Our fine businesses have always been a core aspect of our little community. However, some members of our Society have begun to raise concerns regarding just how much sway these businesses now seem to wield. The question has been raised as to whether we still control our own tower, or if those so-called 'trade barons' do. "

TEN_friend_friendshipcity:0 "Befriend Friendship City"
TEN_friend_friendshipcity_desc:0 "Friendship City is, as far as we can tell, a perfectly respectable settlement. Their people are nice enough, their traders are glad to engage with our own, and they are more than willing to remain on good terms with us. So, it would only make sense for us to treat them in kind and pursue a cooperative relationship."

### Midtown ###

TEN_outskirts:0 "The Tenpony Outskirts"
TEN_outskirts_desc:0 "Not far away from Tenpony, to the west, lies Midtown. It was originally a settlement of the ponies who were refused entrance into the tower, but over time, it has grown to a large town. Occasionally, some of its settlers come to Tenpony to trade. This presents an opportunity for us to exploit."

TEN_midtown_forge:0 "Midtown Forge"
TEN_midtown_forge_desc:0 "We should expand our investment in Midtown. Enough caps to build a forge, where the workers can create all kinds of things with scrap metal, would be a good first step into the settlement's modernization."

TEN_scrap_refinement:0 "Scrap Refinement"
TEN_scrap_refinement_desc:0 "The ponies of Midtown are not the uncivilized savages that some in the tower believe them to be. In fact, they are quite skilled. They found a way to make composite materials out of scrap metal, which can be a great boost to our industry."

TEN_midtown_tools:0 "Tools of the Trade"
TEN_midtown_tools_desc:0 "The new forge in Midtown is proving to be a good investment, as it now produces enough tools that salvaging prewar tools is no longer necessary."

TEN_midtown_weapons:0 "Midtown Arms Factory"
TEN_midtown_weapons_desc:0 "A group of gunsmiths cooperated with us to construct a new arms factory in Midtown. It will be a great help in supplying our troops with proper and reliable firearms in the future, and the only thing they want in return are funds for their newly founded company."

TEN_midtown_homes:0 "Develop New Homes"
TEN_midtown_homes_desc:0 "The average Midtown resident lives in a simple shack building, which is, to put it nicely, not very weatherproof. We should build more modern and durable houses, so that the citizens of Midtown can at least get a small taste of Tenpony's living standards."

TEN_midtown_roads:0 "Roads of Midtown"
TEN_midtown_roads_desc:0 "With the new homes, more ponies from the surrounding regions are moving to Midtown. While this is, at first glance, a positive development, it also means the already old and damaged roads are now hopelessly overloaded. We should repair and expand the current road system, in order to support the new flow of ponies."

TEN_midtown_recycle:0 "Midtown Recycle Center"
TEN_midtown_recycle_desc:0 "In order to save resources, we should construct a recycling center where workers can make tools out of the materials we found in Manehattan's ruins."

TEN_midtown_electronics:0 "Wasteland Electronics"
TEN_midtown_electronics_desc:0 "Radios were a common luxury in pre-war Equestria. Not only were they a good way to kill some time, but they were also a quick and reliable way to deliver any messages, military or civilian. We already have a radio station, now all we need to do is create more radios."

TEN_midtown_factory:0 "Factory for the Tower"
TEN_midtown_factory_desc:0 "While improving the standards of living in Midtown is admirable, we can't forgot about the heart of our nation. Why not combine the useful with the practical and build a factory in Midtown, where workers produce goods that are later sold to our values residents?"

TEN_midtown_research_slot:0 "Tenpony-Midtown Research Coalition"
TEN_midtown_research_slot_desc:0 "We have come a long way in modernizing Midtown. With their wasteland-knowledge and our pre-war-knowledge, future breakthroughs should be achieved a lot quicker."

TEN_repurpose_mall:0 "Repurpose the Mall"
TEN_repurpose_mall_desc:0 "The mall of Tenpony is quite vast, although many of its rooms are useless shops selling counterproductive luxuries. We can remodel the mall into a productive manufactory that will actually benefit Tenpony."

TEN_build_workshops:0 "Build Workshops Into Restaurants"
TEN_build_workshops_desc:0 "What better way to remodel the mall than to convert it into a sprawling military factory! Let's convert its endless restaurants into useful production rooms for Tenpony's military."

TEN_grim_economy:0 "Militarized Economy"
TEN_grim_economy_desc:0 "The merchants of Tenpony enjoy lives of luxury and riches unimaginable to most ponies in the Wasteland. They sit here, enjoying fine wines and cheeses within the walls protected by our brave security forces. Why should these lazy do-nothings be allowed to hoard wealth while those ponies actually working to keep the tower safe are barely afforded even the smallest of luxuries? From now on, all businesses operating within Tenpony will be expected to pay a heavy protection tax, which shall be used to drastically increase our security funding."

TEN_mandatory_conscription:0 "Mandatory Conscription"
TEN_mandatory_conscription_desc:0 "Our current 'military' consists of mercenaries and hired guards, giving our ranks an unloyal connotation. A mandatory conscription will be created, so that we may draft anypony lacking any crucial contribution to the tower.

TEN_conscript_elite:0 "Conscript the Elite"
TEN_conscript_elite_desc:0 "Despite our draft gathering many new recruits, there are still veterans of the tower that remain elusive to the conscription. A new, stronger conscription wave will commence, if only for the betterment of Tenpony's military."

TEN_no_special_privilege:0 "No Special Privilege"
TEN_no_special_privilege_desc:0 "The elites that have dodged our conscription remain convinced they are better off not serving in our military due to their status. While this may fly under others, Grim Star will demonstrate nopony is granted such special privilege."

TEN_train_the_elite:0 "Whip Them Into Shape"

TEN_hunt_society_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that the Twilight Society still remains free from our grasp, the remaining members already plotting to retake the tower from the chief of security.

TEN_stop_bats:0 "Stop the Bats"
TEN_stop_bats_desc:0 "These evil creatures in Marelem proclaim themselves peaceful and claim that they mean no harm to Manehattan. Some fall for their trickery, but it only takes a clear mind like Grim Star's to know their true intentions. It's time we show these revolting 'ponies' some proper authority."

TEN_purify_marelem:0 "Purify Marelem"
TEN_purify_marelem_desc:0 "The city of Marelem has been conquered, but it's fanged denizens plague it still. These bats shall be purified under orders of Grim Star; it is the only way that the light of proper authority can finally shine on Marelem."

TEN_rebuild_marelem:0 "Rebuild Marelem"
TEN_rebuild_marelem_desc:0 "The cleansing of Marelem has led to the province itself suffering, an unfortunate side effect of our righteous purification. Rebuilding the city in our image can help heal it and restore it to its rightful state."

TEN_marelem_jail:0 "Marelem Prison"
TEN_marelem_jail_desc:0 "The idea of a proper prison has trotted our minds for a while, and with our new land and resources, it can potentially become a reality. A bleak penitentiary shall be built in southern Marelem to hold Tenpony's criminals."

TEN_prison_labour:0 "Prison Labour"
TEN_prison_labour_desc:0 "The construction of the prison has been useful to housing our political dissidents, but there are still other uses we could have for our inmates. They can be put to work doing manual prison labour, to perhaps better serve their miserable lives."

TEN_invade_gutterville:0 "Clear the Gutter"

TEN_pacify_gutterville:0 "Pacify Gutterville"
TEN_pacify_gutterville_desc:0 "The residents of Gutterville still resist our authority, rioting with the justification that we have wrongly claimed what little is left of their homes. Pacification is in due order."

TEN_Gutterville_scrapworkers:0 "Gutterville Scrapworkers"
TEN_Gutterville_scrapworkers_desc:0 "One of the few positives of controlling Gutterville is owning its vast quantities of scrap.

TEN_grimstar_scavenge_MoM_desc:0 "The Ministry of Morale's old hub in Manehattan now lies within our terrtiroy, although it is still ridden with hostile sprite-bots. With protection from our guards and some charismatic persuasion, we can send paid volunteers to help scavenge the Hub."

TEN_spritebot_research:0 "Spritebot Research"

TEN_invade_raiders:0 "Make Manehattan Raiderfree Again"
TEN_invade_raiders_desc:0 "Raiders: chaotic, warmongering barbarians that exist only to corrupt the Wasteland, giving it the dangerous reputation it does not deserve. This proves no different for our local Manehattan Raiders, and we shall do our part to rid Manehattan of this menace."

TEN_Manehattan_Overstallion:0 "The Overstallion of Manehattan"
TEN_Manehattan_Overstallion_desc:0 "The Tower lies firmly in Grimstar's hoof. His reforms are in place, the army he created is awaiting his orders and the Society is no longer a threat.

TEN_form_south_manehattan:0 "South Manehattan"

No longer will those bigoted snobs control us, threatening our livelihoods every passing moment. We - the ghouls - have established a front no longer under the hooves of a smoothskin. The time has come brothers! Let’s show the wasteland the justice it deserves."

TEN_ghoul_2:0 "The Pretentious Elitists..."
TEN_ghoul_2_desc:0 "Statists have begun to pop out of the woodwork. A plan must be made to deal with these traitors before they get out of control. Once we find the origin of those smooth skinned rats, we can destroy them once and for all."

TEN_ghoul_3:0 "And the Genocidal Clique!"
TEN_ghoul_3_desc:0 "Grim Star and his clique have proven to be quite the hoofful. Our forces were nearly obliterated in their latest attack, and are to be swiftly dealt with as soon as possible."

TEN_ghoul_masebs:0 "Break into MASEBS"
TEN_ghoul_masebs_desc:0 "The Emergency Broadcast System (or MASEBS for short) is a massive radio system, hosted by Homage, another smoothskin. While the mare has done some good, and spreads an ultimately good message to the wastes, she's in the way of our ultimate goal.

TEN_ghoul_landlord:0 "Appropriate Tenpony Property"
TEN_ghoul_landlord_desc:0 "The Tenpony Administration and its members owned many pieces of property that can be very useful for us.

TEN_ghoul_sj_1_desc:0 "Our takeover of the tower has come with obvious effects. The scumbags who ruled over it before now want to take it back. Expected, but not wanted. We need to begin our search for them and completely wipe them out, before they inevitably destroy our new society."

TEN_ghoul_sj_4_desc:0 "Our militias need their own “spring cleaning”. Smoothskin sympathizers have been found among the ranks, and are to be put down at the nearest convenience. We cannot risk a breach of security at a time like this. Luckily, some of them might know information that we do not."

TEN_ghoul_sj_5:0 "An Example of Force"
TEN_ghoul_sj_5_desc:0 "Our search of the territory has yielded a lone resistance member. Interrogations and some, erm, convincing, is needed. The stallion has proven to be quite the tough one, so we are going to use more “public” forms of ridicule. That should flush the rats out their hole."

TEN_ghoul_sj_6:0 "Society Of Craven Sods"
TEN_ghoul_sj_6_desc:0 "After our latest show of force, several resistance members decided they did not want to risk the same fate. So, they decided to sell out their own peers. Good for us, but really shows what kind of people they are. They’ll be taken care of soon enough."

TEN_ghoul_sj_7_desc:0 "Grim Star’s main stronghold has been located. Thanks to the info of our more, “compassionate” members, we now know where most of their command can be found. Once we sever the snake’s head, the whole creature will rot away."

TEN_ghoul_sj_9:0 "Meeting The Humbled Elites"
TEN_ghoul_sj_9_desc:0 "The Tenpony Administration is full of pampered, craven elitists. Their various crimes number too many, and their verdict is an obvious guilty.

TEN_ghoul_sj_10:0 "A Look At The Ignorant Clique"
TEN_ghoul_sj_10_desc:0 "Those damned brutes in the security team are so incredibly moronic, one can’t help but feel pity for the dogs.

TEN_ghoul_sj_11:0 "Educating Grim Star"
TEN_ghoul_sj_11_desc:0 "Grim Star was the monster lurking in the dark for all of us. Every day, we were forced into fear that one day, that bastard might send in his mercenaries to slaughter us all.

TEN_ghoul_sj_12_desc:0 "Now that all the criminals have been properly prepared, they will be presented to a jury of ghouls. Then, they shall decide what is to be done with them. Shall we make them slaves for public use? Or shall we hang the bigots, and be done with it outright?"

TEN_ghoul_sj_13_desc:0 "Those hedonistic pigs in Gutterville have finally been put under our control. Whether forced or not, this should be considered an act of mercy. They’ll be shown honest justice soon enough."

TEN_ghoul_sj_14:0 "The Fake Oppressed"
TEN_ghoul_sj_14_desc:0 "The bats have finally been crushed and dealt with militarily. It was inevitable that a nation run purely by thestrals would be annihilated, or taken advantage of. Lucky for them, we’re here now. And they shall be shown the error of their own ways."

TEN_ghoul_sj_15:0 "No Mercy For Raider Scum"
TEN_ghoul_sj_15_desc:0 "The raiders of Manehattan have finally been stomped on and will no longer present an actual threat, with all their main leaders being either dead or captured.

TEN_ghoul_sj_20_trial_of_bos_bigots_desc:0 "The bigots of the Manehattan Steel Rangers have now been pacified. While their technological advantage was quite tough to crack, the numbers we had and our sheer will was enough to destroy them.

TEN_ghoul_swarm_tac_desc: "While we do value our comrades very dearly, a thousand deaths is a statistic at the end of the day. Plus, we have hordes of our feral comrades at our disposal. Utilising them to their fullest extent is only the logical thing to do."

TEN_ghoul_raid_arm:0 "Raid Tenpony Armories"
TEN_ghoul_raid_arm_desc:0 "The previous security of Tenpony housed a few armories that contained many weapons, that prove very valuable to us.

TEN_ghoul_war_3_desc:0 "Those hedonistic sons-of-bitches in Gutterville require sobering up. Our liberation is a sign of mercy they surely don’t deserve."

TEN_ghoul_war_4:0 "Invading the City of Friendship"
TEN_ghoul_war_4_desc:0 "In order for our rule of Manehattan to be truly legitimate, its central metropolis, Friendship City, MUST be controlled by us, and us alone."

TEN_ghoul_war_5:0 "Liberation From The Raiders"
TEN_ghoul_war_5_desc:0 "Even though we despise those damned bigots of The Society and Grim Star’s clique, we do have one thing in common; We both share a seething hatred for raiders. Those horrible excuses for ponies all need to be hanged via meathook and gutted. Publicly."

TEN_war_south_tamed:0 "Oh Way Down South..."
TEN_war_south_tamed_desc:0 "The south half of Manehattan is finally in our hooves! Any local resistance will be kept down as much as possible, and their ghouls will be collectivized. But for the rest of the smoothskins? Well... their fate still remains..."

TEN_ghoul_war_7:0 "Forts of the Coast"
TEN_ghoul_war_7_desc:0 "The south holds many spoils that can be taken advantage of. That includes the various crossings which can either help us, or kill us. We should pass a motion, in which we repair pre-war forts in those areas."

TEN_ghoul_war_8:0 "Ghoul Pools"
TEN_ghoul_war_8_desc:0 "The Mare River is the mighty river that lays north of us. While our land armies do well, our naval presence might as well be non-existant. In order for us to efficiently liberate Manehattan, Tenpony must rule the waves."

TEN_ghoul_war_9:0 "Publicly Funded Southern Roads"
TEN_ghoul_war_9_desc:0 "The cost of liberation came quite high. From our ponypower, to the already crumbling roads in the area. But, we could all come together and start repairing these broken roads? Possibly even use some of our slaves to do the work? We might as well work them for all their worth."

TEN_ghoul_war_10:0 "Liberate the Enslaved North!"
TEN_ghoul_war_10_desc:0 "The time has come! The south has been pacified, and now it's time to turn north, beyond the river. The ghouls residing in the territories there have been oppressed for too long. Rejoice! For we are coming!"

TEN_ghoul_war_11:0 "We Did It?"
TEN_ghoul_war_11_desc:0 "We've done it? We've won? Of course it was obvious we would, but the rush of adrenaline we had is gone. Now the shock remains. Let's throw a massive party for everybody! (not smoothskins)"

TEN_triumph_of_glory:0 "Triumph of The Will"
TEN_triumph_of_glory_desc:0 "We've done it. The celebrations are over. But the joy of victory shall remain in us. Our will to freedom has come at last. The security council has outdone itself, and deserves all the recognition it receives. Give them a promotion!"

TEN_ghoul_i_1:0 "Establish the Tower Assembly"
TEN_ghoul_i_1_desc:0 "The age of idiotic xenophobes like Grim Star barking orders like tyrants, is over. The wasteland is home to many intelligent ghouls. Tenpony especially. Let them all have a say in our new government! Every voice counts."

TEN_ghoul_i_2:0 "Revive the Spirit Of Industrialisation"
TEN_ghoul_i_2_desc:0 "The road to liberation is hard. Thus, we must industrialize if we are to even dream of going hoof-to-hoof with some of the stronger powers in the region. The spirit must be revived, just like pre-war times."

TEN_ghoul_i_2_a:0 "Diggin' for Resources"
TEN_ghoul_i_2_a_desc:0 "Resources are not the most plentiful thing we have. We should start broadening our topics of discussion in the Tower Assembly. It is only necessary."

TEN_ghoul_i_2_b:0 "A Use for Pre-War Factories"
TEN_ghoul_i_2_b_desc:0 "We have many old armories and manufactories within our territory. They could be revamped and repaired for public use. Let us introduce that as a topic of discussion in the Assembly as well."

TEN_ghoul_i_3:0 "Introduce Mass Collectivisation"
TEN_ghoul_i_3_desc:0 "In order to further our progress of true liberation, the people must come together as collective and start working for the benefit of the community. It is only necessary if we are to fight against the capitalistic tendencies of smoothskins."

TEN_ghoul_i_3_a:0 "Force It"
TEN_ghoul_i_3_a_desc:0 "Collectivisation failed! Apparently, our nation is also full of craven idiots who's greed controls them! If we can't convince them peacefully, it's time to convince them properly. With a bullet in the head."

TEN_ghoul_i_3_b:0 "Beg for It"
TEN_ghoul_i_3_b_desc:0 "Our collectivising failed! It seems as the community hasn't earned the trust of each other yet. We cannot abandon our morals now, for such a small reason. Let us try once more to convince the people to come together."

TEN_ghoul_i_4:0 "The Will to Rebuild"
TEN_ghoul_i_4_desc:0 "Finally, our people have collectivized. It is time for us to come together and repair the tools used in the old world." 

TEN_ghoul_i_5:0 "Reconstruction of the South"
TEN_ghoul_i_5_desc:0 "Securing the south came at a cost to some of its armories, which can easily be used by us for our own righteous goals. We should try and repair these factories, and make them functional again."

TEN_ghoul_i_6:0 "Guns Made in Marelem"
TEN_ghoul_i_6_desc:0 "Marelem, the ever so useless nation run by thestrals, had equally worthless land and resources. If we can't reuse any of their old factories, let's just construct new ones. Make the land at least worth a damn."

TEN_ghoul_i_6_a:0 "Looting the Elitist Stable"
TEN_ghoul_i_6_a_desc:0 "Stable 29, the property of the once-were raiders, is now in our hands. And by Tartarus, is it rich in everything it seems! None of our intellectuals know how to even work a Stable, so we just opted in for looting the damned thing! It should grant us an amazing boost to our society!"

TEN_ghoul_i_7:0 "Clearing the Gutter"
TEN_ghoul_i_7_desc:0 "Gutterville, for as filthy and degenerate it was, was also not a terribly worthless land. It's rich in scrap metal and electronics, and this could be used to our advantage. We should try to also base an industry there as well."

TEN_ghoul_i_7_a:0 "Our Great Little Metropolis"
TEN_ghoul_i_7_a_desc:0 "With Friendship City properly owned by us now, our energy seems nigh limitless! We should keep this trend of growth going, and keep expanding it's energy output. Let's even construct some dockyards!"

TEN_ghoul_i_8:0 "New Goods from Arbu"
TEN_ghoul_i_8_desc:0 "Arbu, besides its... colorful, inhabitants, is a decent chunk of clay for us. Basing more of a civilian industry there will benefit us nicely."

TEN_ghoul_i_10:0 "The Tech of Bigots"
TEN_ghoul_i_10_desc:0 "The Steel Rangers were bigots, yes, but they certainly did have fine pieces of tech. And their armories was vast as well. Why not use these? It's ours now."

TEN_ghoul_i_11:0 "A New City that Never Sleeps"
TEN_ghoul_i_11_desc:0 "Manehattan is finally ours. It has been rebuilt, and made into the the shining jewel of the wasteland. Some called us mad, but we ignored those naysayers and came together to make something wonderful. Manehattan shall once again be the city that never sleeps."

TEN_ghoul_triumph_of_prosperity:0 "Triumph of Prosperity"
TEN_ghoul_triumph_of_prosperity_desc:0 "Our hard work has paid off. No longer do we need to rely on foreign imports, in order to not go hngry. And no longer do we need to scavenge far and wide for a small piece of scrap. We have achieved total, communal prosperity."

TEN_so_long:0 "A Chapter Ends"
TEN_so_long_desc:0 "Sheriff Rotting Tail's time has finally come. After countless hours, days, and weeks of struggle, growls, and outbursts, it has been concluded that the Sheriff is finally going feral. We always knew it was to come, just never the exact date. It's time to decide, what is to be done with Manehattan's liberator."

TEN_Tenpony_military:0 "Tenpony Military"
TEN_Tenpony_military_desc:0 "As large as the Equestrian Wasteland may be, it is still finite, so we will eventually reach a point when all of the land belongs to somepony. And once this moment comes, we will have to be prepared in order to defeat our power-hungry neighbors or to become the invader ourselves."

TEN_grim_star_doctrine:0 "Grim Star's Doctrine"
TEN_grim_star_doctrine_desc:0 "The best of the best. That's what our ponies must be. We shall win battles through merit and skill, rather than through numbers."

TEN_soldier_training:0 "Soldier Training"
TEN_soldier_training_desc:0 "A soldier not only needs a gun, but he also needs to know his way around it. And while baptism of fire is an option as well, we are not the type of ponies to willingly sacrifice our comrades in combat just to save a few bottle caps, are we?"

TEN_medkit_research:0 "First Aid Kits"
TEN_medkit_research_desc:0 "A dead soldier can't fight. We must invest in medical equipment to assure that as few soldiers as possible die from combat. That way, they may live to fight another day."

TEN_energy_weapon_research:0 "Lightning in a Gun"
TEN_energy_weapon_research_desc:0 "Arcane weaponry is the key to dominating our foes. What is a bullet when compared to a beam of pure heat? A crude pipe gun when compared to a sleek magical weapon?"

TEN_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
TEN_special_forces_desc:0 "What our forces lack in adaptability, they make up for in skill. However, we do still need special divisions dedicated to dealing with those issues that our standard infantry can't deal with."

TEN_life_over_territory:0 "Life Over Territory"
TEN_life_over_territory_desc:0 "We can afford to lose land. We can't, however, afford to lose ponypower. Our soldiers' lives are valuable, and they should be treated as such."

TEN_society_doctrine:0 "Twilight Society Doctrine"
TEN_society_doctrine_desc:0 "We have no interest in invading settlements. We do, however, have an invested interest in providing for the safety and protection of our residents."

TEN_defense_tower:0 "Defense of the Tower"
TEN_defense_tower_desc:0 "Tenpony Tower must remain standing, at all costs. We must focus on ensuring that our last line of defense can stand."

TEN_fireteam_research:0 "Fireteam Support"
TEN_fireteam_research_desc:0 "Rapid fire machineguns are capable of laying down large volleys of lead within a short time. This has proven exceptionally effective at keeping lightly armored enemies at bay. Perhaps we would do well to invest in this weaponry."

TEN_ballistic_weapon_research:0 "Ballistic Weapons"
TEN_ballistic_weapon_research_desc:0 "Guns are the backbone of our security forces. With better guns, we could enhance our guards effectiveness substantially."

TEN_unicorn_research:0 "Mage Support"
TEN_unicorn_research_desc:0 "We have plenty of talented mages within our tower, most of which are already part of our Society. Though we'd rather not risk any members of our Society, we could instead have them teach unicorns among the guards some basic combat spells."

TEN_defense_above_all:0 "Defense Above All"
TEN_defense_above_all_desc:0 "Threats exist all around us. And while we may not wish to go seeking trouble, trouble may come seeking us. We must be prepared to deal with it when it comes, and to defend our residents against all who would seek them harm."

TEN_privitized_military:0 "Privatized Military"
TEN_privitized_military_desc:0 "Caps are plentiful, and soldiers are cheap. Mercenaries, thugs for hire, and anyone wishing to earn a few caps will make up the bulk of our military forces."

TEN_robot_research:0 "Robot Army"
TEN_robot_research_desc:0 "Robots have many advantages in comparison to regular soldiers: They are stronger, we don't lose our fellow ponies in combat and, most importantly, they don't have this absurd construct called "morality", which allows them to follow every order we give them."

TEN_demolition_research:0 "Demolition Support"
TEN_demolition_research_desc:0 "Explosives have proven effective at dealing with what bullets can't. A liberal application of them could be the key to breaking through a line or taking out a threat."

TEN_infantry_equipment:0 "Infantry Equipment"
TEN_infantry_equipment_desc:0 "Despite the recent developments and advancements in robotics, a large part of our army still consists of basic infantry. This has a reason because most robot models are either expensive and/or get easily outsmarted by regular soldiers. Until this changes, we have to invest in infantry equipment, or else we risk getting overrun."

TEN_penal_squads:0 "Penal Squads"
TEN_penal_squads_desc:0 "If there is a law, then there are ponies who break it too. The old Equestria would have just locked them away, but that would be economically stupid. They are consuming our food and doing nothing in return. If we recruit them, however, they will learn some discipline and, if not, die first at least."

TEN_quantity_above_quality:0 "Quantity Above Quality"
TEN_quantity_above_quality_desc:0 "In the wasteland of Equestria, better weapons are almost half the battle - if you are on your own. We, however, have to field an entire army, and thus, we can't focus on expensive upgrades. We rather have our army fully equipped, than only 20% having the best weapons on Equus."

TEN_research_slot:0 "Increase Military Budget"
TEN_research_slot_desc:0 "After all the reforms and improvements, our army is still facing one major issue: It is as underfunded as when we started. Back then, we justified it with our lack of resources, but by now, we should be able to dig a bit deeper into our pockets, shouldn't we?"


### Naval path ###

TEN_gutterville_dockyard:0 "Opening of the Gutterville Docks"
TEN_gutterville_dockyard_desc:0 "Our proximity to our nearby waters draws closer as we annex more territory, and any capable nation must make use of this. We shall open dockyards located in Gutterville, and commence the construction of Tenpony's navy."

TEN_design_ship:0 "Our First Ship"
TEN_design_ship_desc:0 "The designing of a ship is no small task. To make use of our resources and coastal adjacency, we must begin to model Tenpony's navy... or at least take the first step in designing something that can float."

TEN_build_dockyard:0 "A Tenpony Dockyard"
TEN_build_dockyard_desc:0 "No proper navy can be established without sufficient wharfs to house its boats. We must build our own dockyards, worthy for Tenpony's ships alone."

TEN_arm_ships:0 "Arm Our Ships"
TEN_arm_ships_desc:0 "Many ships are created with numerous roles in mind, although their exposure to combat is inevitable. Arming the navy is our first ordeal."

TEN_light_naval_weapons:0 "Focus on Light Weapons"
TEN_light_naval_weapons_desc:0 "Lighter ship weapons are versatile for their potential. They can be armed on more maneuverable ships, they're cost-efficient, and help target smaller ships much more effectively."

TEN_heavy_naval_weapons:0 "Focus on Heavy Weapons"
TEN_heavy_naval_weapons_desc:0 "Heavier ship weapons are universally designed to triumph in one area: firepower. What use are smaller armaments when bigger ones bring more firepower?"

TEN_strengthen_naval_hull:0 "More Durable Hulls"
TEN_strengthen_naval_hull_desc:0 "At the end of a mariners day, it doesn't matter how versatile or capable a ship can be when it can barely handle an hour of combat. Our hulls shall be strengthened so that our ships can remain intact and afloat."

TEN_light_ship_focus:0 "Light Hull Designs"
TEN_light_ship_focus_desc:0 "Light ships bring the advantage of being maneuverable, difficult to detect and cheap to produce. Designs such as canoes and lighter hulls allows us to start the production of smaller models."

TEN_design_medium_ship:0 "Grander Ships!"
TEN_design_medium_ship_desc:0 "While lighter ships may have their uses, it's quite clear they don't last long during the thick of combat. Heavier ship models will be designed, so that our ships may last through the numerous naval engagements to come."

TEN_medium_ship_focus:0 "Tenpony Vessels"
TEN_medium_ship_focus_desc:0 "Medium sized vessels provide their strength in all-around effectiveness. They have the size of smaller, more maneuverable ships while boasting an increased amount of capable firepower."

TEN_design_heavy_ship:0 "Even Grander Ships!"
TEN_design_heavy_ship_desc:0 "A ship may always be improved and expanded upon, even if it takes more resources to build and a larger crew to maintain. Designing even larger ships will bring Tenpony's capable naval strength to Manehattan's waters."

TEN_heavy_ship_focus:0 "Tenpony Warships"
TEN_heavy_ship_focus_desc:0 "Heavy ships are undoubtedly unmatched in naval combat. Although costly to produce, their ability to trek through arduous campaigns makes them perfect for engaging on Tenpony's shores and rivers."

TEN_improve_propulsion:0 "Improve Ship Propulsion"
TEN_improve_propulsion_desc:0 "A ship is useless if it lacks the speed to do anything. Better propulsion systems will be designed so that Tenpony's navy can keep up with any rival boat."

TEN_naval_detection:0 "Eyes of the Ship"
TEN_naval_detection_desc:0 "Detection systems are paramount to the ultimate safety of our ships, and even a ship's simplest detection methods start with the eyes of any capable mariner."

TEN_floating_tanks:0 "Floating Fortresses"
TEN_floating_tanks_desc:0 "New armour modules allow us to coat our ships with stronger plating, more resistant materials and a more durable ship overall. Only after strengthening our ships with Tenpony's most durable metals will we be able to transform our ships into the floating fortresses they are meant to be."

TEN_ship_communications:0 "Ship Communications"
TEN_ship_communications_desc:0 "Communication within a crew is essential, lest an entire ship crumbles internally before it does externally. Improved communication modules as well as revised methods shall ensure any Tenpony crew is a capable crew."

TEN_learn_cloudship:0 "Learn From the Cloudship"
TEN_learn_cloudship_desc:0 "Long ago, Equestria's mighty air force once had ships that were capable of flying across the sky. Though we lack the means to create these flying monstrosities for ourselves, we can still try to learn from their designs in order to improve our own seafaring vessels."

TEN_rustwreck_ships:0 "Study Rustwreck Ships"
TEN_rustwreck_ships_desc:0 "Dotting the coasts and shores of Rustwreck are a great deal of old wartime ships once belonging to Equestria's navy. We can learn much from this ancient beasts, which once dominated the seas."

###Operation Cauterize###

TEN_enclave_attack:0 "The Enclave Attacks!"
TEN_enclave_attack_desc:0 "Death from above! The Enclave has descended from the skies to invade our fair city. All across Manehattan, ponies are being slaughtered and settlements destroyed. We must take action at once if we are to be prepared for this threat."

TEN_midtown_airstrip:0 "The Midtown Airstrip"
TEN_midtown_airstrip_desc:0 "Though we can't hope to truly match the Enclave in the air, we can at least try to contest the skies above our tower. We must set about constructing an airstrip as quickly as possible, from which we could attempt to house our own air force."

TEN_rooftop_AA:0 "Protect the Tenpony Rooftop"
TEN_rooftop_AA_desc:0 "The Enclave has a natural advantage when it comes to controlling the skies. This makes us highly vulnerable to attacks from above. To defend our tower from any such attack, we must be ready and able to fight from our rooftop."

TEN_across_the_river:0 "Sent Troops Across the River"
TEN_across_the_river_desc:0 "Sitting here and waiting for our enemy to come to us won't do us any favors. If we wish to fight against this invasion, we must send our finest soldiers to help fight the Enclave in the north."

TEN_defend_river:0 "Defend the River"
TEN_defend_river_desc:0 "We must hold our lines at the river. Should those lines fall, it won't be long before our tower falls as well!"

TEN_enclave_out_manehattan:0 "Push Back the Enclave!"
TEN_enclave_out_manehattan_desc:0 "The Enclave dares step hoof into our city, as if they own the place! It's time we remind them that somepony already lives here, and they're not willing to share with a bunch of winged bastards who think they can do whatever they please."

TEN_they_shall_not_cross:0 "They Shall Not Cross!"
TEN_they_shall_not_cross_desc:0 "The Manehattan River spans and divides our fair city. If the Enclave wishes to get to our tower, they have no choice but to cross over it, be that by bridge, air, or water. It is therefore in our interest to prevent them from doing so."

TEN_emergency_recruitment:0 "Emergency Recruitment"
TEN_emergency_recruitment_desc:0 "This is not the time to be sitting on your flanks. All must get up, get ready, and fight if we are to defend our tower! To arms, ponies, to arms!"

TEN_gun_for_everypony:0 "A Gun for Everypony"
TEN_gun_for_everypony_desc:0 "We must kick our arms production into overdrive if we are to supply all of our soldiers. We'll make sure that the Enclave runs out of bodies before we runs out of guns and lead!"

TEN_twin_city_alliance:0 "Alliance of the Twin Cities"
TEN_twin_city_alliance_desc:0 "Friendship City and Tenpony Tower must stand together in these trying times. We will send an alliance proposal to our sister city. Hopefully they will see the ongoing threat to our very existence and accept."

TEN_hire_talon_mercenaries:0 "Hire Talon Mercenaries"
TEN_hire_talon_mercenaries_desc:0 "We have little choice but to levy our wealth to aid our army. We shall do such by hiring the finest mercenaries in the Wasteland to come aid us in fighting back the pegasi menace."

TEN_united_manehattan:0 "A United Manehattan"
TEN_united_manehattan_desc:0 "When the Enclave first descended upon our city, we stood as little more than a collection of bickering factions and settlements. This made us all easy targets. Now, Manehattan stands united as one against the pegasi who seek to destroy us all.§OThe Enclave can not and shall not win.§!"

TEN_radigator_meat:0 "Imported Radigator Meat"
TEN_radigator_meat_desc:0 "Fresh meat is hard to come by within the ruins of Manehattan, and manticores have a rather unappealing taste to them. However, the fine ponies of the small settlement of Arbu have shown themselves to be more than willing to trade their own food with us. It's a bit funny tasting, but it sure beats the canned stuff, and our residents are enjoying it immensely."

TEN_radigator_meat2:0 "Elite Cuisine"

TEN_gut_armorshop:0 "Armor Workshop"
TEN_gut_armorshop_desc:0 "Gutterville has cornered the armor market, producing high quality protective gear in substantial numbers.

TEN_marelem_business:0 "Tenpony Investors"
TEN_marelem_business_desc:0 "The rich come down from Tenpony with more caps in their pockets than our ponies have seen in their entire lives.

TEN_rubber_bullets:0 "Rubber Bullets"
TEN_rubber_bullets_desc:0 "Our tower has long utilized rubber bullets as a non-lethal way to deal with troublemakers. Though we've sold these bullets to outsiders, our sales have always been limited, and we've always had to restrict our usage of them. After all, our supply was finite. Now, thanks to a dedicated manufactory, we are able to produce large quantities of this specialized ammunition. This has been a boon to both our security forces and our economy."

TEN_import_economy:0 "Import Economy"

The walls of Tenpony must never fall."

TEN_quantityabove:0 "Quantity Above Quality"
TEN_quantityabove_desc:0 "Having a small force of guards is great, but having a large force is even better.

### Advisors ###

grimstar_advisor:0 "Chief Grim Star"
grimstar_advisor_desc:0 "The long-time captain of Tenpony Security, Chief Grim Star is ever vigilant in ensuring the protection and safety of the tower and it's residents. Though his loyalty to Tenpony is unquestionable, many have doubts regarding his methods."

TEN_rotting_tail_commando:0 "Sheriff Rotting Tail"
TEN_rotting_tail_commando_desc:0 "Not a leader, but a guide for our people, Rotting Tail has successfully brought us together to take out the bigots and the Tower, and leads us by example, not by force. His skills as an army leader are also not to be underestimated as well. His various raids on the Twilight Society have given him much experience in guerilla warfare, and they will continue to prove useful now that he leads a proper force."

life_bloom:0 "Life Bloom"
life_bloom_desc:0 "A talented medic and a highly skilled mage. He serves as the Twilight Societies foremost expert in memory magic, and spends much of his time experimenting with various spells. He is also very involved in gathering information about various Tenpony residents."

TEN_spymaster_ghoul:0 "Lavrentiy Leash"
TEN_spymaster_ghoul_desc:0 "Personal bodyguard to Sheriff Rotting Tail, this fanatical stallion is not to be trifled with. His loyalty to the revolution could only be rivaled by his supreme lust, in both blood, and smoothskin mares. While their fate matters little, he does go to the extreme at times. But his more, private, hobbies are overshadowed by his excellent work in rooting out traitors, with fear and intimidation tactics, and a large web of equally loyal spies. We just hope that talent doesn't fall into rival hands."

TEN_silent_workpony:0 "Buckshot"
TEN_silent_workpony_desc:0 ""

TEN_silent_workpony_ghoul:0 "Humming Cap"
TEN_silent_workpony_ghoul_desc:0 "A true flower in the cold wastes, Humming Cap, sister to Messy Cap, is a younger ghoul mare who embodies the true compassionate revolutionary. While her more pacifist nature isn't exactly the most expected, her kindness to ailing ghouls, and excellent charisma, especially in the Tower Assembly, is much appreciated. Such a soul like her is too good for this world."

TEN_backroom_ghoul:0 "Black Saber"
TEN_backroom_ghoul_desc:0 "A stallion who grew up in the paranoia fueled terror of old world Equestria, Black Saber is a pony who has seen things, and know what they are capable of. An old school revolutionary, he personally believes in a vanguard for the revolution, rather than just than the great experiment that we have here. Of course, we would shoot him for such statist words, but he assured us he would not attempt anything. Plus, when the communes reach a period of instability, he's pretty good at keeping the peace, and keeping them loyal."

TEN_war_industry:0 "Grand Bolt"
TEN_war_industry_desc:0 "Grand Bolt began his career as a weaponsmith apprentice in a small settlement to the far west. He went on to spend much of his life traveling across Equestria, lending his skills and expertise to many different factions and settlements. In the end, he ended up at our fair tower, where he hopes to eventually retire."

TEN_war_industry_ghoul:0 "Oskar White-mane"
TEN_war_industry_ghoul_desc:0 "Oskar White-mane was a well known arms-smith in the wasteland, often doing freelance work in order to make some caps. When he arrived at Tenpony, they shut him out completely and even threatened his life, just because he was a ghoul! This outraged him heavily, thus he found himself helping us out. Thanks to his knowledge on pre-war weaponry and craftiness in wasteland arms, our factories are always operating at max efficiency."

TEN_civil_industry:0 "Fair Bit"
TEN_civil_industry_desc:0 "Once upon a time, Fair Bit was just another of the many merchants in the Wasteland, owning a small shop in an equally small settlement to the north. That changed when she discovered a cache of wartime weaponry, which she quickly sold to the highest bidder. The resulting wealth would then be invested into starting up a successful caravan company, which still persists to this day. After amasssing a sizable amount of wealth, she moved down to our tower to enjoy a life of relative luxury."

TEN_civil_industry_ghoul:0 "'Big' Little Smog"
TEN_civil_industry_ghoul_desc:0 "Little Smog is most certainly not very big, contradicting the name. But that nickname has been given to him after many acts of intimidation to the fortunate smoothskin laborers. He wields a very large gun, which he refers to as 'Sixth Hoof', and as said before, uses it to threaten factory workers under his command. Thankfully, they are just smoothskin slaves we've 'employed', so it matters not what he does to them, as long as they stay docile and he doesn't end up killing them all."

TEN_scientist:0 "Perfect Precision"
TEN_scientist_desc:0 "Some fields of science, both material and arcane, require that every single variable be exact. Should there be a mistake, it could result in dire consequences. That is why we have Perfect Precision, a truly remarkable pony who has never once been off on a measurement."

TEN_scientist_ghoul:0 "Prof. 'Smart-Ass' Berry"
TEN_scientist_ghoul_desc:0 "Professor Berry is an incredibly smart stallion. In fact he's the smartest one out of almost all the ghouls. Which truth be told, is not really that high of an accomplishment. We don't really know his story, as he's quite secretive about it, but assures us he has never worked for any fascist paramilitary organisation, which is good enough for us. He specializes in robotics, and assures us that soon no ghoul will ever have to perish again, thanks to the robots taking care of business. Nice fellow, still a smart-ass though. Hence the name." 

society_member_army:0 "Twitchy Hooves"
society_member_army_desc:0 "Twitchy Hooves is hardly what one would expect a security officer to be. He lacks any sort of combat expertise, and has lived most of his life in relative safety. However, he is also a valued member of the Twilight Society, and is highly unlikely to ever step out of line."

TEN_entrenchment:0 "Golden Vision"
TEN_entrenchment_desc:0 "Once upon a time, there was a young colt by the name of Golden Vision. His father, and his father's father, and his father's father's father were all scavengers. So, of course, he knew that someday he too would be a scavenger. That is, until the scrap hut his family lived in collapsed with them inside. He was the only survivor of this incident. This would lead to him vowing to ensure that noponies home would fall in on them ever again. Unfortunately, his dream wouldn't sway the other residents of his town. After a long series of failed campaigns, he would eventually leave the settlement where he grew up. One thing led to another, and he soon found himself in our employ."

TEN_entrenchment_ghoul:0 "Dull Trovel"
TEN_entrenchment_ghoul_desc:0 "Dull Trovel, is, erm, not what you call smart. He means well, but can't seem to think hard before it starts to hurt. Luckily though, he loves digging. With a passion, for some reason. And so that's what he does. No matter how tough it is to work the irradiated soil, he does with ease."

TEN_army_morale:0 "Ivory Mane"
TEN_army_morale_desc:0 "Ivory Mane wasn't born to wealth. He grew up in the outskirts of Manehattan, and joined a band of mercenaries at a young age. His mercenary career would be cut short by half of his band, including it's leader, getting killed by raiders. From there, he moved from town to town and providing protection services to anyone who could pay. This would lead him to being under the employ of our tower as a security officer."

TEN_army_morale_ghoul:0 "Red Thread"
TEN_army_morale_ghoul_desc:0 "Red Thread, another relic from the pre-war past, but possibly even greater. This ancient mare was once an incredibly dedicated supporter of the workers' revolution in pre-war Equestria, and frequently traveled across the land with her group, singing songs only of solidarity and freedom. Until she was arrested for charges of treason. Of course, that didn't last long, because the megaspells eventually freed her, but not in the way she expected. Overtime though, she made her way to the Tenpony ghoul settlement, in which she continues to brighten up the mood of our militiamen every day." 

TEN_grimstar_special_forces:0 "Chief Grim Star"
TEN_grimstar_special_forces_desc:0 "The long-time captain of Tenpony Security, Chief Grim Star is ever vigilant in ensuring the protection and safety of the tower and it's residents. Though his loyalty to Tenpony is unquestionable, many have doubts regarding his methods."

TEN_twilight_society_member:0 "Short Wit"
TEN_twilight_society_member_desc:0 "If there is one pony who is truly despised within the Twilight Society, it is Short Wit. His lazy apathetic attitude has been the topic of many angry rants from other Society members, and there have been many attempts to kick him out of the Society. All of these attempts have failed though, as he enjoys the favor of the Societies highest ranking members for reasons unknown to most members."

TEN_infantryadvisor:0 "Pure Flame"
TEN_infantryadvisor_desc:0 ""

TEN_infantryadvisor_ghoul:0 "Scarlet Flood"
TEN_infantryadvisor_ghoul_desc:0 "A master in mass attacks, Scarlet Flood doesn't pretend to think the ferals are really sentient. Even if they are some way his comrades as well, their minds are gone. And all that is left is a weapon that can be used. And uses them he does. The stallion knows the importance of our own ghoul troops, and how rare they are. If he can sacrifice one million ferals, and only ten regular ghouls, he would."

TEN_logistic:0 "Thundershot"
TEN_logistic_desc:0 "Thundershot has had a long and mostly successful career as a mercenary. He oftentimes became the quartermaster for the companies he joined, a role which he now holds within Tenpony Security."

TEN_logistic_ghoul:0 "Colonel. Joe"
TEN_logistic_ghoul_desc:0 "A cold hard pragmatist to the end, this ghoul will starve his troops for days, if rations are low and need to be preserved. Once a math professor in the pre-war era, now he's an army officer for us. His mathematical skills have helped greatly when managing the logistics of the militias, and his pragmatism is always appreciated in a sea of zealots."

TEN_organisation:0 "Stout Guardian"
TEN_organisation_desc:0 "Stout Guardian's father was a valued member of Tenpony Security. He grew up knowing that he would one day be wearing a security uniform, and now he does. However, despite his upbringing, he has managed to garner a reputation for being a troublemaker."

TEN_organisation_ghoul:0 "Messy Cap"
TEN_organisation_ghoul_desc:0 "Contrary to the name, Messy Cap is not messy. Far from it. She's also one of the strictest (and somewhat cruel) officers we have. Ever unit she's commanded has always been the fastest to recover and get back into battle. Whether it's because of how scared her troops are of her, her efficient medics, or because she rarely loses her battles. Either way, she's a tough mare."

TEN_fort:0 "Eternal Stronghold"
TEN_fort_desc:0 "Eternal Stronghold dreams of building forts. So building forts they shall do."

TEN_fort_ghoul:0 "Andre Bünker"
TEN_fort_ghoul_desc:0 "A very odd ghoul, Andre was once an engineer for the old Equestrian Army, often destroying enemy bunkers. Then, when the war drifted to mainly defense, he was tasked at building even BETTER bunkers than the enemy. And so he did. When the balefire bombs dropped, he was actually in the middle of constructing a particularly large fort in the Severyana region. The thickness of its walls saved him from death, but not from severe burns which are a bother for him everyday."

TEN_backroom:0 "Sunny Seduction"
TEN_backroom_desc:0 "If there was one pony within Tenpony Tower who everypony liked, it would be Sunny Seduction. She has managed to talk her way into the good graces of the Twilight Society. Now, she puts her charisma to use convincing everypony of the merits of our leadership."

Midtown_Arms:0 "Midtown Arms Factory"
Midtown_Arms_desc:0 "The Midtown Arms Factory has rapidly become one of our largest arms producers. Their expertise when it comes to weapons manufacturing could prove very useful moving forward."

TEN_landadvisor:0 "Book Bind"
TEN_landadvisor_desc:0 "Book Bind is certainly a bit of an outcast among Tenpony Security. Physically frail and averse to confrontation, he isn't capable of performing many of the day-to-day duties of a security officer. However, his knowledge of historical military tactics is second to none, making him a potentially valuable asset."

TEN_landadvisorghoul:0 "Crimson Bayonet"
TEN_landadvisorghoul_desc:0 "Crimson Bayonet, while not the most zealous out of our fine little experiment, is a damned fine army leader. Time and time again, he has planned and succeeded in small, but successful raids on the old Tenpony security. And now that he commands an even bigger force than before, he has some fine ideas he's just waiting to implement."

TEN_airadvisor:0 "Cloud Dreamer"
TEN_airadvisor_desc:0 "Nopony is sure why Cloud Dreamer is named such. Some claim she took the name herself to reflect her ambitions, while others theorize that she has pegasus ancestors. Whatever the case may be, her name has proven fitting, as she spends much of her time dreaming of flying through the clouds. Few take her seriously, and she wouldn't even be a resident of our tower if not for her extensive knowledge of cloudships and cloudship components. As is, she leads many of our airport salvaging efforts."

TEN_airadvisorghoul:0 "Azure Ash"
TEN_airadvisorghoul_desc:0 "Azure Ash never chose to be the chief advisor for the airforce. In fact, he never wanted it. His eyes are incredibly sensitive to sunlight, but he always had an affinity for airplanes. He was pressured into taking up the role by his peers, and only holds it for the rare praise and admiration he gets from time to time. Though, he hopes one day that he may one day pilot his own plane."

TEN_navyadvisor:0 "Wave Prospect"
TEN_navyadvisor_desc:0 "Wave Prospect was once little more than a humble fisherpony. In his youth, he found his boat stranded out at sea during a terrible storm. After the storm came to an end, he found himself in posession of such a large supply of irradiated fish that he could feed half the Wasteland for months. From there, he led a successful fishing company for a long time, before selling his assets and retiring to our tower. His knowledge regarding naval management and operations could come in handy though."

TEN_navyadvisorghoul:0 "Boiling Seas"
TEN_navyadvisorghoul_desc:0 "This old ghoul was actually once an admiral in the pre-war Equestrian navy. While he mostly forgot some of the more vital information in his time, he still holds some that proves to be quite useful to the ghouls. Boiling Seas lives to see another battleship again, even if it was just once."

TEN_air_reform_horse:0 "Flight Worthy"
TEN_air_reform_horse_desc:0 "Flight Worthy is regarded by some to be little more than an overgrown foal playing a game of pretend. The cardboard wings he insists on wearing everywhere certainly do little to dissuade this perception. Indeed, if it weren't for his inheritance, he would likely have been kicked out long ago. He spends most of his days insisting to anypony who will listen that he is actually a pegasus, and reading about famous Equestrian air battles."

TEN_air_reform_ghoul:0 "Safe Trip" 
TEN_air_reform_ghoul_desc:0 "Safe Trip used to pilot a commercial Equestrian airline, back in the pre-war era. While he was piloting one, a megaspell was dropped, in which he's had traumatic nightmares ever since.

TEN_decisive_navyhorse_desc:0 "Admiral Fleet is not a real admiral, but you would be excused for believing him upon first introduction. His authentic Equestrian admirality uniform and the confidence in which he proclaims his role is enough to convince most ponies with no argument. In actuality, he was once a well-respected Captain in Rustwreck, before he declared himself to be the 'true admiral' and called for Admiral Tides immediate resignation. Unfortunately for him, his own crew wasn't willing to go through with his insane ambitions, and quickly mutinied against him. Following this, he was sent into exile, and is now residing in our tower as a political refugee."

TEN_decisive_navyghoul_desc:0 "We actually don't really know who this 'Pitch', is. Not even if that's his real name. Pitch was once apart of the old ghoul settlement, but only recently decided to take up the mantle of a chief navy officer. We don't know how, but the pony is a naval mastermind. Even when he's never seen any of the ships before, which he has admitted. Last time we tested him, his Luck was at the highest level."

TEN_commerce_navyghoul_desc:0 "One of our most colorful comrades yet. Burnt-Hide, according to himself, was a pre-war pirate who lived the life of a princess, bathing in waves of loot, food, and mares. The captain was wanted by both the Zebricans and Equestrians, because he was such a nuisance to them both! And the only reason he became a ghoul in the first place, because he was too distracted with his massive meal to notice the sirens blaring and the megaspells going off. We aren't sure how accurate this is. But nonetheless, the stallion knows his trade."

TEN.1.title:0 "The MAS Hub"
TEN.1.desc:0 "Tenpony Tower. A luxury hotel, known for housing the Ministry of Arcane Science's Manehattan Hub. When balefire began raining from the sky, those ponies working within the Hub were some of the first to know. Orders came in from Canterlot to fire the prototype megaspell Celestia One at Roam, capital of the Zebrican Empire. Knowing that Manehattan would be a primary target, the ponies of the Ministry had to make a choice. They could follow their orders and focus on casting the megaspell, or ignore their orders and focus on using the Manehattan Emergency Broadcasting System to warn the residents of the city. There wouldn't be enough time to do both, and the seconds were ticking down."
TEN.1.a:0 "Sound the Emergency Broadcast System."
TEN.1.b:0 "Fire Celestia One!"

TEN.2.title:0 "Walls of Balefire"
TEN.2.desc:0 "Tenpony Tower was able to survive the wrath of the balefire bombs thanks to a series of thick steel walls that coat the MAS Hub. Unfortunately, it was still heavily damaged with the outer walls ripped apart and not a single window survived the shockwave. Soon after irradiated air seeped into the tower. A group of volunteers had requested that they take their protective suits from their labs and go out to repair and fortify the outer walls. Another group had proposed that they'd leave the outer walls to be used as a trap for ghouls and other abominations and instead focused on fortifying the still functional inner walls."
TEN.2.a:0 "Repair the outer wall."
TEN.2.b:0 "Fortify the inner walls."

TEN.3.title:0 "Outside Communication"
TEN.3.desc:0 "The years following the balefire were harsh, even to the relatively lucky occupants of Tenpony Tower. The tower was never stocked to be a long-term survival shelter, and the MAS's emergency provisions would only last so long. As a result, the ponies within rapidly found themselves running out of food and supplies alike. So, the moment the radiation levels outside were deemed "acceptable", a scavenging expedition was launched to obtain crucial supplies. However, the ponies of this expedition quickly found that they were not the only ones within the devastated ruins of Manehattan. They found a nearby settlement, built with scrap on top of old ruins. Upon getting closer to the settlement, they were shocked to find it full of the undead! The expedition backed away and considered their options. They could attempt to approach these things and see if they were willing to trade. Alternatively, they put an end to these abominations and take all they have. After all, what need do the dead have for food?"
TEN.3.a:0 "Try approaching the zombies."
TEN.3.b:0 "Make the dead stay dead."

TEN.4.title:0 "Ghoul Problem"
TEN.4.desc:0 "Life in our tower was very serene, safe and calm (for those who had the caps), but it seems that peace can come to an end. One of our major trading partners has provided us with valuable information regarding the ghoul population in Manehattan. Namely, the location of a large settlement of zombies near our tower. It's amazing how they have not attacked us yet, given the carelessness and the unreadiness of our guards when it comes to defending against massive mobs of hostiles. It may just be ghouls, but the problem of their unwanted neighborhood being so close to us needs a solution. We'll begin by sending scouts to get an idea of their population and defences, before we move on to actually preparing to be rid of the problem."
TEN.4.a:0 "We'll send our best to check them out."

TEN.5.title:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
TEN.5.desc:0 "Grim Star sat in his office, pondering on what he heard. A large, by Wasteland standards at least, settlement of ghouls exists right under Tenpony's nose. While most of them were more or less reasonable, their leader was clearly close to becoming feral. Not only that, but Tenpony Security was woefully ill equipped to deal with the issue. The unicorn did not see a way out of this situation, except to contract an outside mercenary company to put an end to the problem once and for all. While smoking a smoldering cigarette, he turned his gaze out the window and gazed at the ruins of skyscrapers, cracked paved highways, and the rusted remains of the Celestia line. Exhaling smoke, he came to a decision. The mercenaries would be contracted, but the deal would have to be struck under-the-table. The ponies in charge would never agree to such dire action being taken against the ghouls, even if they were personally disgusted by such creatures. Furthermore, they wouldn't agree to spending valuable caps on having mercenaries do such dirty work. And so, throwing away the cigarette butt as it burned his lips, he began writing a contract."
TEN.5.a:0 "Grim Star concludes a contract with Blackwing and her mercenaries."
TEN.5.b:0 "The Twilight Society learns of his plans and stops Grim Star."

TEN.6.title:0 "The Star Fell and Crashed"
TEN.6.desc:0 "What was I hoping for? That they would they praise me, or that they would pat me on the head with a hoof? Grim Star considered the events leading up to his arrest. The negotiations with Blackwing had went well, the contract had been signed, and the griffons promised quick results. However, upon returning to Tenpony Tower, Grim Star quickly found his own security officers pointing guns in his faces. It seems someone from within their ranks had caught wind of this deal and reported him. Whether they were on the Twilight Societies payroll, or they were just seeking personal gain from his removal, he knew not. He could however rest easy knowing that at least the ghouls would still be dealt with, and the tower would be safe. Even if he rotted in this cell for the rest of his life, it would have been worth it for having ensured the safety of Tenpony's residents."
TEN.6.a:0 "He shouldn't of tried to slip something past the Society."

TEN.7.title:0 "Ghouls Slaughtered"
TEN.7.desc:0 "Word has come in that a small peaceful settlement of ghouls has been slaughtered to the last by a band of mercenaries hired by Tenpony's Chief Grim Star. We're afraid that news of this atrocity has already begun to spread across all of Manehattan, and many are now considering our tower to be responsible for it. It's to the point that some settlements are now even considering halting all trade with us and refusing to cooperate with us further. The only silver lining to all this is that we don't have to worry about the ghouls ever attacking us."
TEN.7.a:0 "Curse you, Grim Star!"

TEN.8.title:0 "DJ Pon3's Broadcast"
TEN.8.desc:0 "\"Got your ears up, faithful listeners? Cuz I've been talkin' and some of you ain't been listenin'. For years now, I've been reminding you that ghouls and zombies ain't the same thing. Ghouls are ponies who have had the misfortune of soaking up a major dose of magical radiation and not dying. That stuff twists and rots their bodies, but unlike zombies, their minds are still like those of any other pony, and they deserve t' be treated as such.\"\n\n\"Well, some of you ponies up in Tenpony Tower didn't get the message. And when Sheriff Rotting Tail kept pressin' for him and his ghouls t' be allowed inside, just cuz they were sick of being hounded by manticores an' slaughtered by bloodwings, Chief Grim Star, the head of Tenpony security, responded by hiring a bunch of mercenaries to scour the tenements along the Celestia Line and wipe them all out.""

TEN.9.title:0 "Returning Officers"
TEN.9.desc:0 "The security officers returned from their reconnaissance. Unfortunately, they were discovered by the zombies and one died as he fought them valiantly head on, giving his fellow officers time to escape. A full report of the investigation has been delivered on Grim Star's desk."
TEN.9.a:0 "We will honour our fallen officer when all of this is over."

TEN.10.title:0 "Opening of the Tenpony Library"
TEN.10.desc:0 "We are happy to announce the opening of the new Twilight Sparkle Library! The Library is both a place of learning for our residents and a monument to the Ministry Mare herself and her life's work.\n\nLocated at the far end of the commercial district, the Library will operate during standard daytime hours, Monday through Saturday. All residents are granted free entry and rentals, though outsiders are expected to pay a small fee for such.\n\nIt will also host books from Twilight Sparkle's own personal collection. Much of this rare literature has not been available to the public since before The War itself and has, until now, been lost to time.\n\nWe hope our valued residents will make use of and enjoy this new facility. Have a good day, and happy reading!\n\n- The Tenpony Tower Administration."
TEN.10.a:0 "Knowledge is finally being restored to the wasteland."

TEN.11.title:0 "Questionable Books Found"
TEN.11.desc:0 "The Ministry Mare was very fond of books, regardless of their contents, to the point where she would ensure that there would be at least one surviving copy of every book destroyed by the Ministry of Image. While this was very admirable and noble of her, it has led us to our current conundrum. A stash of books once deemed unacceptable for public consumption have been found within one of the many hidden rooms of our tower.\n\n The books in question are a collection of various ideological works. From Caramel Marks works to the autobiography of Aryanne Hoofler, there are all sorts of radical ideas being presented in these books. This has led to a heated debate regarding what we should do with these works. Some members of our Society believe that there is little harm in distributing these books to the public, but others call for the immediate destruction of what they call dangerous literature. We'll have to reach a decision regarding this at some point, though it isn't the most pressing of issues."
TEN.11.a:0 "We have found the forbidden knowledge."

TEN.12.title:0 "DJ Pon3's Broadcast"
TEN.12.desc:0 "In an interview, when asked how he had managed to be such a supreme douche bag, Chief Grim Star had this to say:\"\n\nAnother voice, gruff and irritated, came through the radio's speakers. \"Fuck off. I did what was right by those I swore to protect.\"\n\nDJ Pon3's voice returned. \"Just warms the heart to know that there are ponies steadfastly defending prejudice and bigotry, doesn't it? Thank you, Chief Grim Star and may Celestia bless you with a kiss from the sun.\" The last certainly sounded like it was said through gritted teeth."
TEN.12.a:0 "..."

TEN.13.title:0 "New Member of the Administration"
TEN.13.desc:0 "You nervously look over your shoulder. The quiet halls of the Tenpony Tower are, as one would predict from the very late hour, empty. The only sound you can hear is the quiet buzzing of the long, weak lights in the ceiling. As you pass door after door leading to various suites for the wealthy residents, your eyes finally lay on the door right at the end of the corridor. The silver-coated plaque on the solid, wooden frame reads '13.4a', which - to your knowledge - is a small storage room for brooms, buckets and other, mostly useless items.\n\n After making sure you have the correct address, you quietly push the door open.\n\n What appears before your eyes is far from what you had expected. The shelf opposite of the door, usually filled with a complete mess of cleaning supplies and old junk, was now standing aside, and behind it - much to your surprise - was a small, obscure passage that led further down. With increased cautiousness you close the door behind you, and then - fighting with the instinct to run away and forget about this entire ordeal - you make your way past the shelf.\n\n As you progress down the small corridor, you encounter another door. Having committed to your choice already, you only slightly hesitate before opening them. Then, before your very eyes, lies a candle-lit room with a round table. A small number of ponies, well-dressed even for Tenpony standards, are sitting around it, with only one chair left vacant: the one closest to you.\n\n\"Have a seat,\" says one of the figures, a dark-red coated stallion with a surprisingly deep voice. Left with no other choice, you follow the request. As you take your place by the table, the same voice speaks out again. \"For the last few decades, Tenpony Tower remained a bastion of civilization in the war-torn ruins of Manehattan. It was not only thanks to the powerful magic protecting its walls, not only because of the disciplined and well-trained security forces, no. Even the most powerful nations need a guiding hoof to lead them and ensure their prosperity.\" A small pause ensued, which was broken by another voice - this one belonging to a mare with a white coat and a silvery mane. \"Throughout generations, we were that guiding hoof. We ensured that the Tenpony Tower would remain strong and safe from the dangers of the outside world. And now we wish you joined us in that endeavor. All ponies suddenly stood up, smiled, and gently bowed their heads as the stallion spoke again."
TEN.13.a:0 "\"Welcome to the Society.\""

TEN.14.title:0 "A Change in Management"
TEN.14.desc:0 "Residents awoke this morning to discover that Tenpony Tower had undergone a change in management overnight. A number of security forces loyal to the former disgraced Chief Grim Star have taken full control of the Tower, stationing loyal guards at each security post and declaring martial law. All residents are expected to have a valid reason to move through any security checkpoints, and access to the Administrative District has been fully restricted.\n\nDue to the ongoing lockdown of the Administrative District, the Tenpony Armory has been repurposed to serve as a temporary administrative office for the Tower. All members of the previous Tenpony Administration are currently under house arrest, with their fates uncertain. Various security staff and trusted residents have been appointed to temporarily manage the Tower. \n\nAs for Grim Star himself, he was released from his cell in the early hours of the morning. Though he had very little to do with directing the apparent coup itself, he has now assumed full command of his forces and of the Tower. In an official statement, he had this to say:\n\n\"I wish to reassure every resident of Tenpony Tower that I, and all of Tenpony Security, have only their best interests at heart. Know we did not take this action lightly, but rather, we took it only to protect and further the interests of every one of you. We know that this change may be sudden, and many ponies have already expressed a great deal of concern regarding it. However, we are fully dedicated to ensuring that this transition is as smooth as possible, and we look forward to resuming normal life soon enough. Until then, just remember that we are your friends, not your enemies.\""
TEN.14.a:0 "Times are changing."

TEN.15.title:0 "You Gotta Shoot 'Em in the Head"
TEN.15.desc:0 "The ghouls thought themselves to be well defended, behind their scrap walls and salvaged barricades. And perhaps they would of stood a chance if they were just facing a disorganized gang of raiders, or a small band of slavers. However, much to their misfortune, they weren't facing either of those. Rather, they were facing the full might and force of Tenpony Security!\n\nOn Grim Star's orders, a small army of our finest guards set about wiping out the ghoul threat. Though their makeshift walls may of made our approach difficult, they proved to be the only real obstacle we faced. All it took was blowing them down with explosives, and then charging in. From there, it was like shooting mutated fish in an irradiated barrel. Most of the zombies didn't even have guns!\n\nDespite our success, it isn't all good news. That damned Sheriff Rotting Tail managed to take out several of our brave guards as they were attempting to breach the walls. A funeral service will be held for them, and plans are already being drafted for a monument to their sacrifice. At least Rotting Tail and his ilk will never bother us again."
TEN.15.a:0 "Another threat erradicated."

TEN.16.title:0 "Revolt!"
TEN.16.desc:0 "This is a message from the rightful Administration of Tenpony Tower, now broadcasting from the reclaimed Tenpony Information Center. We ask that those of you who are sensible and wish to see a return to sanity aid us in our cause, to restore peace and order to the Tower that we built up.\n\nOn this day, one year ago, the traitorous and maniacal Grim Star forcibly seized control of the Tower that this Administration worked so hard to make great. This terrible move is one that we could of forgiven, if it had been but a misguided act of protectiveness towards our valued residents. However, this was not the case. The traitor's actions then, and since then, have been those of a mad man, who cares only about his own power and little more. What he has down has ruined our great tower, destroyed the lives of our residents, and destroyed our reputation across the wasteland.\n\nThis must end.\n\nAs we speak, those loyal to the cause of serving our residents are moving to secure the Mall. Though the battle may be fierce, and though our losses may be many, we know that it is preferable to Grim Star's ongoing madness. A madness that goes against all this Tower has ever stood for! Even now, he barricades himself in his armory like a coward! We shall drag him out by his flank if we must, and force him to face trial for the crimes he has committed during his illegitimate rule!\n\nWe also are extending an offer to those of you among Grim Star's ranks who are still rational enough to recognize his madness. Any who throw down their arms and surrender will not be held accountable for anything they were forced to do under Grim Star's rule. Rather, they shall be welcomed back as full residents of our beloved Tower, just as soon as we resecure our rule.\n\nTo those resident's still trapped within Grim Star's clutches, we tell you this, hang in there. Help is on the way.\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely, the Tenpony Tower Administration."

TEN.23.desc:0 "It is well known that Tenpony Tower is much larger than it looks from the outside. A recent discovery just proved this once more.\n\nA few days ago, a maintenance group was clearing out one of the many hallways on the western side of the building. Apparently, a corridor has been buried by countless boxes and other remnants of the former Equestria since the end of the war. After the debris had been removed, our team faced a smaller corridor with four rooms on both sides.\n\nThere is a terminal at the entrance, that used to list all the items inside of them. Most of the data became corrupted by now, however, we managed to restore some of it.\n\nWhile it's not impossible to hack the interlock of the doors, it's time-consuming and our technicians are already needed on other locations, so we can only open one door at once."
TEN.23.a:0 "Life is full of surprises."

TEN.24.title:0 "Heavy Lifters"
TEN.24.desc:0 "Alright, it should work now.\", said the technician as he rebooted the terminal. It was old and rusty, so it took some time. But eventually, it loaded all the data.\n\nHe opened the document and sighed in relief. Some words were still not restored, but at least the file is now readable:\n\"Room 1, corridor 2a:\n50 heavy lifters, used in ×»^'Ë9á¾Ü³>& for the transportation of heavy lab equipment s prototypes. We have better models by now, so only use them as reserves.\n- Prof. Dark dßRÕÄ\"\n\nThe recovery team opened the door, hoping for the best, and they were lucky: Only eight lifters didn't survive over the years. The rest, however, was still intact and functioned properly. Sure, there are more advanced models by now, but if we have no other option, they can do the job too."
TEN.24.a:0 "Now if that's not some good news!"

TEN.25.title:0 "Armor Storage"
TEN.25.desc:0  "Almost... done\", said the technician, struggling to recover the data. \"That should be it. Now we're gonna rebooted this thing and see if it works.\"\n\nWhile the terminal was booting up, the technician was visibly nervous. He knew that if it didn't work, he could start all over. Luckily, his fears have proven untrue and the file was readable again:\n\"Room 3, corridor 2a:\nI know I'm not authorized to do this, but I'm just gonna store these here. Or does anypony ´'íÕSSý§û)? No, so where's the problem? Anyways, a company from èðšñ will come and pick them up next Monday. Three stripped PA, 20 T45d PA, and six T51b PA. All of them are outdated and too damaged or obsolete for the front, so we're gonna sell them. It's not my fault that ¯¶{¸» didn't give me clear orders.\n-Cpt. Swift Wish\"\n\nThe recovery team proceeded to open the door, hoping the power armors were in the same shape as the heavy lifters. One minute later, the door was open and the team relieved. The power armors were still functioning. A bit rusty and old, yes, but nothing that our mechanics can't handle."
TEN.25.a:0 "Say again that something like luck doesn't exist."

TEN.26.title:0 "Ammunition Storage"
TEN.26.desc:0  "Ok, I think I've got the hang on it.\", the technician rebooted the terminal. After four times, he sort of knew what he had to do. The uncertainty, if the data was properly restored or not, was gone - you could almost say that it became a routine. Anyways, everything worked out as expected and most of the data could be saved.\n\n\"Room 5, corridor 2a:\nA convoy arrived today with tons of small arms. That is all well and good, but Major Lucky Star is just an idiot. Not only were we forced to use the stairs instead of the elevator when we brought the boxes up here, but he also had to choose the shabbiest room to store them in. It'll be a wonder if the water pipe survives another week, but then it's not my fault if EÏHÑÓJŸ®Þ8T; are useless.\n- Cpt. ûvP? Wish\"\n\nThe recovery team faced a dilemma. They don't know if the water pipe flooded the room and if the storage survived it, so hacking the door lock could be a waste of time and resources. However, if they're not opening it, restoring the data would've been an even bigger waste. They considered their options for a bit and concluded, that opening it is the best option.\n\nThe technician did his job and a few moments later, the door stood wide open. The ponies used their flashlights and what they saw shocked them to the bones. The room was full of unused grenades, which could've gone off at any time during the past 200 years. Luckily, the water pipe was broken as the Captain predicted and flooded the room, making most of them useless. Only 50 - 70 were still intact."
TEN.26.a:0 "Could have been worse."

TEN.27.title:0 "Magical Weapon Prototype"
TEN.27.desc:0 "This one's definitely easier than the last one.\" The technician confidently restarted the terminal. He was still unsure if everything worked as intended, but at least he wasn't so nervous like the last time. His hopes became true and they had access to the file.\n\n\"Room 4, corridor 2a:\nAlright, I want that nopony, absolutely NOPONY, enters this room without my clear permission.

Lightning $¢°k\"\n\nThe ponies of the recovery team were excited. What was so special about that rifle, that even the MAS had to bring it to a different site? The technician didn't need to be told twice and in a possibly record-breaking speed, he opened the door.\n\nThe ponies stepped inside and were presented with a rather macabre scene. A rifle was placed on a table and around it were 5 or 6 half-melted skeletons. The rifle itself pointed towards a hole in the wall, which was about one meter in diameter, and contained a crystal that was bright enough to serve as a source of light. \n\nThe team didn't know how to proceed. One wrong move and they ended like the skeletons. But if they just leave it in the room, they risk that the rifle goes off eventually and no one knows what would happen then. They figured that it'd be the best to call their scientists and as it turned out, the rifle was too damaged to be used. But with proper analysis, we could replicate some parts for our own magical weapons, with better security measures of course, and have a good magical weapon."
TEN.27.a:0 "That was close."

TEN.28.title:0 "Computing Technology"
TEN.28.desc:0 "Ok, that should be it. This was more difficult than expected. Let's see if it works\", the technician rebooted the terminal and stepped back. For the last hour, he tried to restore the data, and if this didn't work, he wouldn't know what else he could do. Fortunately, he found the issue and saved the file.\n\n\"Room 2, corridor 2a:\nThe MAS is driving me crazy. Every other day, they're asking me 'Are you done yet?', 'When will you finish it?', Ëþà!ÎO³ They just don't understand the problem. If something is made by ponies, it can be beaten by ponies. And the encryption of terminals is no different pZ that. Anyways, I think we're close to a breakthrough, so maybe I can ýoTáÒf the deadline by a month.\n- Prof. Dr. Midnight Sparkle\"\n\nThe recovery team was excited. If the Prof. achieved his breakthrough before the mega spells dropped, it could be a large gain for our intelligence network. The technician opened the door and the ponies went inside. However, what they found was rather disappointing and only a few blueprints and idea concepts were inside. We'll give it to our IT team, perhaps they can use them somehow."
TEN.28.a:0 "Let's hope we have more luck with the other doors."

TEN.29.title:0 "The Secure Door"
TEN.29.desc:0 "Deep within Tenpony Tower, hidden behind several fake walls and magical illusions, resided a door. On the surface, it looked to be a very simple door, one made of wood with a cheap plastic handle. However, as the Twilight Society knew all too well, looks can be deceiving. \n \n What initially appeared to be a rather mundane door was in fact one of the most secure entryways within the entire tower. Physically, the wood was merely a facade for hard metal that made up the actual door. The handle did nothing, with the real unlocking mechanism being entirely arcane in nature. More wards were placed on it than the tower itself, protecting both the door and the room it guarded. The best minds of the Twilight Society spent weeks analyzing each and every spell placed upon this entryway, trying to discern any possible method of unlocking it. A breakthrough was had, and it was determined that it would accept only a vocal phrase from a select individual. And so, one of the younger members of the Society was tasked with playing holotape recordings of various high ranking M.A.S officials, including the Ministry Mare herself. After a week straight, the correct phrase was found."

TEN.30.desc:0 "A great rumble shook Tenpony Tower, as a mighty door at its very heart opened. Numerous security wards were dispelled, automated turrets were put offline, and a young inductee would be the first to witness what appeared to be an impossibly huge library. More senior members of the Twilight Society were quick to respond, and a formal expedition into this well-guarded room was hastily organized. \n \n Within a hour, every senior member of the Society was brought together. As one, they made their way into this great library that had been kept secure for so long. Every book was contained within plain binding, with no titles or other markings denoting their contents. The first theory to be thrown out was that these were copies of banned literature. Another theory was that these all contained knowledge better left forgotten, dark magic and horrible hexes that were too evil for the public to have access to. They all tensed as a less cautious member of their group pulled a tome off of one of the many shelves along the wall, opened its cover, and began to read. \n \n 'A Rainbow Romance, by Twilight Sparkle.' \n \n Upon further examination, every single one of the thousands of books contained within the room seemed to be along similar lines. A simple vote was held, and it was decided to reseal the room and forget it had ever existed."
TEN.30.a:0 "Let's never speak of this again."

TEN.32.title:0 "Make Contact with Gutterville"
TEN.32.desc:0 "Starry Gaze looked at his either side, glancing at two other ponies assigned to the arduous task of reestablishing contact with the population of Gutterville. Since the Lightbringer rescued them from the mad ghoul doctor, the talks of bringing them back into Tenpony Tower's sphere of influence dominated the Twilight Society's conversations. He knew from the beginning that it was just a matter of time before they made their move, and now his assumptions were confirmed.\n\nAs they walked in near complete silence, save for the clopping of their hooves against the cracked asphalt, the unicorn stallion frowned as the shabby-looking huts of the settlement appeared in their line of sight. After spending most of his life behind the safety of Tenpony's walls, any outside building seemed puny and irrelevant, but he - unlike most of the Tower residents - was perfectly aware that not everypony could afford luxury, and oftentimes it wasn't even their fault.\n\nIt then came as no surprise that he had been elected to represent the interests of the Society in contact with smaller settlements scattered around Manehattan, with Gutterville being the first on the list. If Tenpony were to grow and become stronger, they needed the trust of local ponies and who would do the job better than a simple wastelander's sympathiser?\n\nA grunt from one of his colleagues dragged him away from his thoughts. They were here. Starry Gaze stopped for a while, looking at the curious faces of local townsponies who noticed the newcomers. They all showed some degree of curiosity; some gave them distrustful looks. The unicorn finally sighed, fixed his clothing, and proceeded to try and find Gutterville's mayor."
TEN.32.a:0 "Time to bring Gutterville back home."

TEN.33.title:0 "Guard Gutterville"
TEN.33.desc:0 "Gutterville has never been the most pleasant of places to live, nor has it been the safest. The residents of this unfortunate settlement have been reminded of that recently, after a nine year old foal went missing. The town sent out a search party, which found itself ambushed and maimed by manticores. There was only one survivor. \n \n Following this occurrence, Tenpony Tower has decided to take action to prevent similar tragedies in the future. A detachment of guards will be sent before the days out to help protect the impoverished settlement. "
TEN.33.a:0 "They will be able to rest easy at night."

TEN.35.title:0 "Invitation from Tenpony" (Gutterville)
TEN.35.desc:0 "Our relationship with Tenpony Tower has been largely positive as of late. While our people once looked upon their tower with a mix of anger and envy, both despising them for keeping their wealth to themselves and wishing that they had such wealth, those days are now long gone. Their guards help protect our streets at night, their merchants trade with us constantly, and their aid has allowed us to turn our squalor into a proper settlement. So, it comes to no surprise that they would like to take our relationship to the next level. \n \n A delegate from Tenpony has arrived today, asking that we unite with them to a greater level. This would result in them being given power over us that they had previously lacked, and would mean that our people would be expected to help defend their assets and interests. However, the benefits could more than outweigh the downsides of this arrangement, as we would both be more protected ourselves and have increased trade with them. Should we accept?"
TEN.35.a:0 "Prosperity awaits. Accept!"
TEN.35.b:0 "This is too far. Decline!"

TEN.36.title:0 "Gutterville Denies"
TEN.36.desc:0 "Gutterville has declined our generous offer, much to our surprise. Apparently they believe that their current relationship with us is more than enough, and have no interest in taking it any further. Unfortunately for them, our offer only had one correct choice."
TEN.36.a:0 "They should have accepted."

TEN.37.title:0 "Invitation from Tenpony"
TEN.37.desc:0 "Tenpony Tower, our Eastern neighbor, has helped us many times before. Thanks to their support, we were not only able to finally get rid of these raiders that have been doing unspeakable things to us for as long as we can remember, but we also have some sort of an industry now. Now, it's apparently time for us to do something in return for them, and they ask for nothing more than our membership in their newly founded alliance.\nOn one hoof, it's the least we can do for them and it would be only fair if we helped them after they helped us.\nBut on the other one, it would still mean that we will lose all of our sovereignty. Some of our citizens are already worried about Tenpony's increasing influence, and by accepting this invitation, we would lose the little independence we have left.\nThe decision is anything but easy, but we have gone through so many struggles by now, we'd survive this one as well."
TEN.37.a:0 "Tenpony is our ally, backstabbing them is just wrong."
TEN.37.b:0 "Tenpony underestimates us, we don't need them."

TEN.38.title:0 "Marelem Denies"
TEN.38.desc:0 "A rather surprising message arrived from Marelem. Out of unknown reasons, [MAR.GetLeader] came to a conclusion, that he doesn't need our help. We still are not sure if it was out of ignorance, overestimation, or sheer stupidity, but he will soon regret his decision, once our soldiers come for him."
TEN.38.a:0 "Are we really the only sane people in the wasteland?"

TEN.39.title:0 "Send help to Marelem"
TEN.39.desc:0 "Marelem is far from the safest place in Manehattan. Their 'unique' residents have attracted quite a lot of attention, very little of it positive. Raider gangs often make it a sport to take potshots at them, and full out attacks on their town is hardly uncommon. They live in constant terror and fear, unsure if the next raid is going to be their last. \n \n This state of affairs is unacceptable, and it is our duty to see to it that the good ponies of Marelem can live free of danger and fear. A guard detachment shall be sent to them immediately, and we'll make raiders rethink their life choices once their potshots are returned in kind. This will also substantially further our relationship with their settlement, and go a long ways towards endearing us to the locals."
TEN.39.a:0 "Good luck!"

TEN.40.title:0 "Dwindling Financial Budget"
TEN.40.desc:0 "Every day, our treasury is just a little more barren. Not near as many caps as we would like are coming in, and far too many are going out. Our beancounters have begun to crunch numbers, and we've come to the unfortunate conclusion that we're rapidly going bankrupt. If things don't change soon, we won't even be able to afford food, let alone paying our guards or furnishing our halls."
TEN.40.a:0 "This is a crisis in the making."

TEN.41.title:0 "Recovering Economy"
TEN.41.desc:0 "Our budget has finally been balanced. With just as many caps coming in as going out, we no longer need to worry about our impending financial collapse. Though our economy could be better, things are stable enough now to restore the faith of our businesses."
TEN.41.a:0 "What a relief."

TEN.42.title:0 "Aftermath of the Raider War"
TEN.42.desc:0 "The Raider War was a violent and brutal affair. Many good ponies died, but it was all for a greater cause in the end. The raider menace has been beaten back, and the ponies of Manehattan are finally free of their reign of terror. And now, all of the raider's territory is ours. Which is a bit of a problem. \n \n Our security forces aren't really equipped or trained for occupying large stretches of land, making this a bit of a headache for us. To deal with this issue, and to finally stop the pounding in our heads, the idea has been proposed to transfer some of this new territory to Marelem. We're sure they'll appreciate it."
TEN.42.a:0 "Let it be their problem."

TEN.43.title:0 "New Opportunities"
TEN.43.desc:0 "The raiders have been driven back, law has been restored, and southern Manehattan is safe at last. This is great for the ponies who can now enjoy safety and comfort like they have never had before, but it is even better for our merchants who now enjoy a new influx of wealth. Trade flows across our little slice of the city, and business is booming like never before. \n \n And yet, it isn't all good news. Though the caps are trading hooves constantly, a disproportionate amount of them are finding their ways in the hooves of a few business barons. These individuals, all of which are from our fair tower, are finding themselves in control of more and more businesses across the city. This is a situation we should keep an eye on, lest we find our own control being challenged."
TEN.43.a:0 "At least we're rich."

TEN.44.title:0 "Expand Business to Gutterville"
TEN.44.desc:0 "Gutterville is a terrible settlement, full of poverty and countless dangers. Their ponies live in squalor, their scavengers die by the dozen, and life there is generally just really miserable. However, they are also surrounded by ruins full of valuable materials. Scrap metal can be very useful, and as a result very valuable. There's profit in the air, and we fully plan on capturing it. This will also help their community thrive, so we're really doing a service for them."
TEN.44.a:0 "Profit awaits."

TEN.45.title:0 "Expand Business to Marelem"
TEN.45.desc:0 "The settlement of Marelem is located near one of our most traveled trade routes, and has always had great economic potential. Unfortunately, the dangers in the region have prevented them from actually being connected to said trade route before now. Raiders, wild animals, and petty gangs all infested the ruins and have harassed anypony who dared to move through that area. However, thanks to our efforts, the area has grown safe enough for our traders to finally take advantage of it. Marelem may enjoy being integrated into Manhattan's economy at last. "
TEN.45.a:0 "They'll be a valuable trading partner."

TEN.46.title:0 "The Trade Barons"
TEN.46.desc:0 "It has been a concern of ours for a while that a select few ponies have rapidly grown to become richer than our tower itself. Their business empires practically own our economy, and the influence they wield within our territory is immense. Even more concerningly, not one of these 'Trade Barons' is a member of our Society. If action isn't taken soon, they could very well grow to become even more powerful than us, enough so to perhaps even steal Tenpony Tower itself from us. \n \n Unfortunately, any action we take against them will inevitably slow and damper our economy. And there's no real guarantee that they will seek any power over us. After all, shouldn't immense wealth be more than enough for them? The decision must then be made: do we work to limit their influence through regulating their businesses and restricting their expansion, or do we let them continue as is?"
TEN.46.a:0 "The Trade Barons are a threat to us. Limit their influence."
TEN.46.b:0 "They would never try anything against us. Let them continue."

TEN.47.title:0 "Protect the Celestia Line"
TEN.47.desc:0 "The Celestia Line has been a great boon to our economy, allowing merchants and travelers to come to our fair tower with relative ease from the rest of the city. Unfortunately, wealth has a tendency to attract some unsavoury types. Raiders, bandits, and simple highwayponies are all trying to set up shop along the route. Though our security forces have thus far been able to repel them, they have unfortunately taken some losses in the process. In order to help protect them, and to further deter any efforts to harass this line, we shall begin constructing fortifications along it. Sturdy walls, automated turrets, and tall towers shall all help us ensure its security. Should it ever come down to it, we will be able to defend it against even an army!"
TEN.47.a:0 "We need to build a wall, and the raiders shall pay for it!"

TEN.49.title:0 "Emergency Recruitment"
TEN.49.desc:0 "The Grand Pegasus Enclave is in our city, and our forces are being overwhelmed by their relentless assault. Food, healing potions, and guns are all in short supply, with everything going towards the war effort. Even more concerningly however, we don't have anywhere near enough ponies to cover all of our land in the face of such an assault. If we want to win this war, we have no choice but to do the unthinkable: we must begin conscripting ponies. \n \n Understandably, many of our residents are opposed to the idea of being sent to die for us. The wealthy in particular feel that they have quite a lot to lose, and have instead come to us with an offer: they would be more than willing to fund the war effort, if we would refrain from conscripting them. Should we allow this arrangement, or is ponypower far more important?"
TEN.49.a:0 "We need their money. Let them buy their way out."
TEN.49.b:0 "All ponies shall serve, regardless of their wealth!"

TEN.50.title:0 "Tenpony Requests Military Access"

There are dark days ahead, and we are left fearing not just for our cities future, but our very survival altogether. \n \n We are not alone in our fears, it seems. Tenpony Tower has sent us an offer to band together in these trying times, for our two cities to help defend the other against the pegasi invasion. While this would help ensure our own defence and safety, we would also be expected to send our ponies to die for Tenpony's land. It might just be better for us to conserve our ponypower and try to weather the storm, rather than to join them in their efforts."

Unfortunately, it gets even worse than just the possibility that we've been eating pony this whole time. \n \n Our efforts to be known far and wide for our luxury 'radigator' dishes have backfired in a way we never could have predicted. Now, ponies all across Manehattan are convinced that we are cannibals, just like Arbu itself.

Word has already come in from numerous small settlements of their crimes, with many innocent ponies being set aflame or reduced to ash. More and more refugees pour in every day, and we are forced to recognize the fact that they will soon be coming for us as well. \n \n In response to this, an emergency meeting has been called between every and all ponies of influence within Tenpony.

TEN.77.title:0 "A Standing Tenpony"
TEN.77.desc:0 "The Chief stretched his neck and lifted himself from his desk. The papers he had spent so long using were organized neatly, as he attached them to a nearby clipboard and  stuffed the leftover drafts into a drawer. Roughly content with his work, Grim Star began to smirk in satisfaction, a rare sight to see as the brief moment of delight lapsed as he could hear steps from across the hall. \n\nA Tenpony official entered the room, an auburn stallion with a short, well-cut mane. He wore a high-ranking insignia on his uniform, indicating his high status in Tenpony's new cabinet and his connection to the Grim Star himself. Entering the office, he didn't inquire as to why he was summoned for long as he glanced at Grim Star's desk. Even compared to when he was only tasked with managing the security of the tower, this is the busiest the Chief had ever been, as the earth pony could well observe. \n\nGrim Star broke the assistant's thoughts by levitating the documents towards him, the auburn pony glancing at the large heading at the top of the page in surprise. \n\nTenpony will be getting its very first mandatory conscription."
TEN.77.a:0 "A necessary draft for our ambitions.."

TEN.78.title:0 "The Elites"
TEN.78.desc:0 "The new conscription draft of Tenpony Tower had been going considerably well. For the first time since Tenpony had opened its doors to the Wasteland, it had implemented a draft completely unfamiliar to its residents. Used to having hired guards loyal to not much else other than a bi-weekly payment, having a standing military would be a considerable change of pace for the military of Tenpony. The security offices would be turned into barrack rooms, and the locker rooms into varying armories. Tenpony's residents would finally have a military that could specialize in quantity as well as quality.\n\nNot everything was going as hoped, however. The draft may have accomplished its original goal of acquiring recruits, but the standing elites of the previous administration still elude our grasp. A newer, more concise conscription wave will commence: the main priority being the recruitment of the veterans who seek to laze in their cabins instead of serving in the front lines."
TEN.78.a:0 "Elites or not, you will help serve your tower."

TEN.79.title:0 "No Special Privileges"
TEN.79.desc:0 "The problem with being recognized as a 'veteran' is that you earn a status that would not fly under anyone else.\n\nThis is no different for the revamped military under Grim Star. The new draft, as successful as it was to swell our ranks with recruits, had been dodged by those who think themselves too worthy of serving in our military. Better yet, some of them have an elitism so haughty they don't bother hiding, but instead simply refuse to enlist in our ranks.\n\nThis elitism did not last long. Of the few remaining elites hiding in their homes, they were all dragged out and hauled to the barracks. Those who simply think themselves too highly to serve as "cannon-fodder" were forced through means that others would seem as quite brutish. But the Overstallion does not see a difference in these ponies. If they fit the criteria, they shall serve and fight for our tower."
TEN.79.a:0 "The draft does not discriminate."

TEN.80.title:0 "A Proper Military"
TEN.80.desc:0 "Training is an area already familiar to the Chief of Security. \n\nEven with a successful draft and the enactment of a standing army, there was still much work to be done to make proper use of Tenpony's new military. The many recruits that fill our barracks, while plentiful in quantity, lack the quality that Grim Star needs for his ambitions.\n\nThe Overstallion wasted no time overhauling Tenpony's training. Entire regimens were overhauled and new ones introduced, with the less strict modules now improved to exemplify the harshness of true combat. Our guards, while relatively competent thanks to their veterancy in their posts, are now much more skilled and experienced as a result. Our officers, once far too haughty with the skills to barely compensate, now vigorously trained in leadership and tactical wits. Even the elites, who previously sought to dodge the draft and evade our front lines, are now eagerly honing their skills in our ranges, with some already putting their skills to good use as they practice against mutants outside Tenpony. \n\nOur military, once filled with mercenaries loyal only to those that could fill their pockets, now a proper force to be reckoned with across the entire Wasteland."
TEN.80.a:0 "Tenpony expects no less."

TEN.81.title:0 "Plotting In The Dark"
TEN.81.desc:0 "While his position as leader of Tenpony and the tower had solidified nicely since the coup, it would only take a fool to proclaim their safety clear, and Grim Star is definitely no fool. As their leader in security for years, he knows that the Society thrives in secrecy and mystery. Obstinate and adamant, the unicorn inherits his qualities from his previous duties while serving under the Society. Now, he recognizes their feeble-minded goals that still endanger Tenpony, and wastes no time to let them bicker in whatever shadows they still claim. The execution of their leadership, while successful in calming the qualms of Tenpony, has not gotten rid of this organization just yet. Rather, it has only given them the time they may need to retake Tenpony for themselves. \n\nGrim Star wastes no time in letting this happen; as every last flame of the Twilight Society shall be extinguished."
TEN.81.a:0 "This pathetic resistance will only be a memory."

TEN.82.title:0 "From The Surface"
TEN.82.desc:0 "The objective was set, and the plan was made abundantly clear: the Society still lives, albeit as fractured remnants, and they still plot to vengefully recoup Tenpony and resist our authority by any means necessary. Grim Star makes it clear that this newfound resistance has managed to spread into every corner of the tower's new administration, sprouting slowly from their shadows as they've managed to infiltrate our day-to-day operations. Some members of the resistance have integrated almost seamlessly, already spreading their influence to those naive enough to believe them and fall for their tricks, all underneath our noses. \n\nEradicating this resistance shall be swift, Grim Star claims, starting by uprooting the resistance from its exterior. While they have seemingly managed to implant dissidents into much of Tenpony's working residence, discerning one resident from another is a feat only manageable by Tenpony's security... \n\nand all it will take is a single night."
TEN.82.a:0 "Extinguishing this resistance starts from the surface."

TEN.83.title:0 "Interrogate Society Members"
TEN.83.desc:0 "Grim Star looked on as the pony before him flailed in clear agony. They were only on the sixth pin, but it seemed that the traitorous wrench was already approaching her breaking point. Just as the pin began to pierce her flesh, Grim Star held his hoof up and brought a halt to the interrogation.\n\nStepping in front of the prisoner, Grim Star examined the full extent of the damages. She was beaten, bruised, bloody, and had several rods of metal sticking out of her. So all in all, not the worst he'd seen that day. Satisfied with the results, he gently lifted her head so as to look her in the eye before speaking.\n\n'You know, it doesn't have to keep going. You can make this all stop, bring an end to the pain and suffering. At any time, if you just agree to cooperate, I will personally offer a full pardon to you and make sure you are given food and treatment.'\n\nAt first, she merely looked at him with the same defiance they all held. Yet as the seconds ticked by, this defiance rapidly crumbled in the face of her own plight. A minute passed. In a voice rendered hoarse by dehydration, she spoke. And Grim Star smiled."
TEN.83.a:0 "'I'll tell you everything I know.'"

TEN.84.title:0 "An End to the Society"
TEN.84.desc:0 "The attack was quick and without warning. One moment everypony was sitting around, organizing their next strike and coordinating information. The next, it was all utter chaos, as Grim Star's forces stormed into what had until now been the Twilight Societies headquarters.\n\nA brief gun fight broke out, as those capable of fighting scrambled for their weapons and tried to fight off the assault. This act of resistance would be one of the last, as each one of the rebels quickly fell, and the invading forces secured the room. Marching in, Grim Star surveyed the area before issuing his orders.\n\n'Grab everything you can. Papers, supplies, weapons, everything. I want it all secured in our armory before sunrise.'\n\nAs his soldiers moved to carry out his orders, he smiled. Though they may still resist him, this would be the definitive blow that would mark the end of the Twilight Society."
TEN.84.a:0 "A victory over traitors."

TEN.85.title:0 "The Gutterville Massacre"
TEN.85.desc:0 "The ponies of Gutterville should have been overjoyed to be taken over. They were delivered away from their miserable existence and made a part of a far brighter future. Yet they resisted and fought. Their ponies protested our rule, ambushed our patrols, and demanded their independence be returned. Such ungrateful behavior could not go unnoticed, nor could it go unpunished.\n\nWhen the ponies of Gutterville gathered for their daily protest, they were not met with the understaffed rookies that were usually assigned to patrol this part of town. Instead, they faced an organized mass of professionally armed and trained soldiers, proudly wearing the colors of Tenpony Tower. In spite of this, they continued as they usually would, shouting their calls for freedom to the air. Their protest would be interrupted by a single shot fired into the air, as a unicorn officer stepped out of the guards ranks and addressed the gathering.\n\n'Good ponies of Gutterville! Grim Star has extended his mercy to you, and is willing to give you this one chance to peacefully disperse. Return to your homes, and all will be forgiven.'\n\nSilence, before an empty Sparkle-Cola bottle came flying at the officers head. Ducking and retreating, he shouted the final words that many of those present would hear."
TEN.85.a:0 "So be it. Open fire!"

TEN.86.title:0 "The Bat Question"
TEN.86.desc:0 "One problem has plagued our fair tower for a while now: batponies. Those creatures of the night occupy Marelem, and have caused quite a stir among our ranks due to their many unusual qualities. Indeed, more than a few foals tales regarding how the evil bats will steal them away into the night if they don't behave had emerged. This of course has done little but alienate them, driving a wedge between Marelem's population and the rest of our ponies. Something had to be done, thus a meeting was called.\n\nThose gathered were in open debate, with all sorts of ideas being thrown at the wind. Diversity programs, forceful integration, or just segregation were all being put on the table. Grim Star didn't so much as consider any of these plans, merely watching as his high ranking officers debated and argued for several minutes before stepping in.\n\n'You are all fools and imbeciles. Diversity? Inclusion? You're lucky I don't have you all executed for such incompetent ideas! There is no room for such vile creatures in our nation. Here's what we're going to do'\n\nThe longer he talked, the more uncertain each of those present became. What he proposed was nothing short of mass murder, an atrocity far worse than anything they had carried out before. Grim Star's word was law though, and they were left with little choice but to carry out his plan."
TEN.86.a:0 "Goddesses forgive us for what we must do."

TEN.87.title:0 "The Barbarism of Ponykind"
TEN.87.desc:0 "When word of what Arbu had done hit Tenpony, it was understandably met with open revulsion. How could such a peaceful settlement turn out to be nothing more than undercover cannibals? How could anyone resort to such extremes, to consume their fellow pony? Such a horrific act was unthinkable to many across the tower, but that is precisely what had happened. In response to the situation, Grim Star gave a speech to the disgusted masses.\n\n'Hello, ponies of Tenpony and beyond. Many of you already know me, but for those who have not tuned in to our radio in a while, I am Chief Grim Star, leader and protector of Tenpony Tower. Recently, the vile ways of the small settlement of Arbu have come to light. Most who learned about it have responded with disgust, but I must confess that I was not surprised in the slightest. You see, when the world ended two centuries ago, so too did the ideals of good governance. And without a proper firm hoof guiding our nation, we have devolved rapidly into little more than animals. Raiders, cannibals, and worse are all to be expected from our kind when we exist in such a state. If we wish to return from this, to rebuild and be reborn from the ashes, we have no other choice than to enforce and maintain order. And this I promise you, Equestria: Under me, ponykind shall know true order, true civilization, once more. Tenpony Tower shall stand as a beacon of modernity amid a wasteland of primitive barbarism. For without strong leadership, we are doomed to devolve into little more than the cannibals of Arbu. Thank you.'"
TEN.87.a:0 "A great speech from a great stallion."

TEN.88.title:0 "Unbroken Steel"
TEN.88.desc:0 "While the Manehattan Steel Rangers may have officially surrendered to us, a large number of remnants have continued to resist us. We can't send a patrol through Bucklyn without it getting ambushed, and all efforts to dislodge them have thus far resulted in failure.\n\nOver the past few days, our scouts reported greatly increased activity through the ruins, with several large gatherings of Steel Rangers being identified. In light of this, Chief Grim Star ordered the fortification of Bucklyn Cross, anticipating a push by the remnants to regain control of their former base.\n\nIt seems Grim Star was unfortunately mistaken regarding the nature of their movements however. Rather than directly attempt a large push to retake their headquarters, they have instead opted to retake their former outposts. Outposts Raspberry and Caramel have both been retaken, with little resistance."
TEN.88.a:0 "Something needs to be done about this."

TEN.89.title:0 "Battle for Raspberry"
TEN.89.desc:0 "Before the War, Outpost Raspberry was little more than a police station. However, the local chapter of Steel Ranger's converted it into one of their outposts following their rise to power within the region. It has undergone a number of renovations since then, with it's walls all being fortified, and several watchposts being established in the ruins surrounding it.\n\nUnfortunately for us, this made a surprise assault near impossible. Our forces were left with little choice but to simply openly assault, using the ruins as rather lousy makeshift cover. It seems that this was far from desirable though, and we took heavy casualties from the approach alone.\n\nDespite this, our forces carried on, pushing into the police station proper and fighting against our power armored foe in close quarters. It was a bloodbath, and many wonder if it was truly worth it. In the end though, we managed to secure the outpost as our own, and delivered a serious blow to the remnants."
TEN.89.a:0 "A bitter victory."

TEN.90.title:0 "Battle for Caramel"
TEN.90.desc:0 "Caramel is the less fortified of the two outposts, being little more than a repurposed warehouse. Unfortunately, this warehouse stands alone, with few buildings or ruins in the area around it. As a result, our soldiers were left in the open, and were subject to constant barrages from the warehouse's rooftop. Despite this, they pushed onwards.\n\nTrying to push through either the loading bay or the front door would be suicide, so we made our own entrance. Explosive charges made quick work of the poorly maintained warehouse wall, allowing our soldiers to pour in and bypass many of the Steel Ranger's fortifications entirely. We still suffered heavy casualties, but the battle lasted little under an hour before the outpost was secured."
TEN.90.a:0 "Hopefully we can soon put this all behind us."

TEN.91.title:0 "The Cleansing of Arbu"
TEN.91.desc:0 "The orders that many had been awaiting finally came from up high: Deal with Arbu. A swift surprise attack was conducted, and the town was powerless to do much in it's own defence. Those few ponies who managed to scramble for a gun in time were rapidly taken out, as our forces fired indiscriminately at everything that moved. Once the screaming died down and no more ponies could be found, the town was razed to the ground.\n\nWith the destruction of the last house, Arbu was left as little more than a large pile of still-burning rubble and corpses. In time, the land would be resettled, and turned into a proper civilized settlement. For now though, it would serve as a grim reminder as to the sins of ponykind."

From this day onward, our efforts shall go towards rebuilding what was once the greatest city in all of Equestria, for the sake of not just our citizens, but for all of ponykind!'\n\nThe speech ended, as all of Grim Star's broadcasts did, with loud cheering and applause, followed by a brief patriotic tune from the War. However, this speech wasn't just talk. Already, orders had been issued and preparations had been made to work on restoring ruins all across the city. The so-called 'Manehattan Project' would be one of the largest undertakings Tenpony had ever conducted, with the goal of working towards making their city once again the greatest in the nation."

Now though, it stood as a shining example of Grim Star's speeches made real, a beacon of civilization and prosperity for the entire world to look at and admire. What was once a bloody arena had become a bustling marketplace, the various chem dens had become proper living areas and establishments, and the heads on spikes had all been replaced with flags that waved proudly in the breeze. Overlooking it all were proper guards, who looked out for any sign of trouble and put a swift end to anyone that sought to disturb the peace."

TEN.94.title:0 "The Secrets of Power Armor"
TEN.94.desc:0 "Though our war against the Steel Rangers was costly, our victory has brought with it many benefits. Beyond just our new land and resources, we have also managed to secure a large stash of power armor in the depths of Bucklyn Cross. It seems that the armor was deemed unfit to wear by the Steel Rangers, as many of the suits are in states of disrepair. However, we have far fewer reservations than they did and are more than glad to put the armor to use\n\nIn even better news, we believe we could replicate the armor now that we have so many suits in our possession. It won't be the best protection in the world, and it won't compare well against proper power armor, but it's more than enough for us to create dedicated units of heavily armored security personnel."

TEN.95.title:0 "A Bright Future"
TEN.95.desc:0 "Speeches from Grim Star had become increasingly more common as his dream became more and more of a reality. It has become normal to the many residents of Tenpony, and even the residents of Manehattan. After all, he made sure that his voice was broadcast as loud and as far as possible. Today however, his speech was much different.\n\nThe immediately noticeable change was the music. Whereas his speeches would normally begin with just him, today it began with a cheery and patriotic tune. The song played briefly, before being replaced with another voice announcing the arrival of Chief Grim Star, followed by the standard cheering and applause. After all this fanfare, the stallion himself came on air.\n\n'Hello, citizens of Tenpony and beyond! I am here today to proudly announce that the era of savagery and war that we have known for so long is finally coming to an end. Thanks to the efforts of the brave mares and stallions of Tenpony, the Equestrian Wasteland has finally been allowed a glimpse of peace. Vile raiders, hideous creatures, and warlike remnants alike have all met us in battle, and they have all fallen before our bullets. How, you may ask, have we survived such odds? How have we overcome such challenges? \n\nThat is simple. We have a just cause, a noble cause, while our enemy had little more than their own selfishness to drive them. Our valiant forces did not fight just for their own lives, nor even for their homes. They fought for something far greater, for ponykind as a whole. With this drive, with this dedication, they persevered in the face of adversity, time and time again.\n\nNow we stand as the greatest beacon of prosperity that our world has known in 200 years. All thanks to the sacrifices and efforts of those who fought for a greater cause. In honor of them, and in honor of all who have helped make this dream a reality, I am officially announcing that the city of Manehattan is no more. Such an old name was rendered meaningless long ago, when our nation was reduced to little more than rubble and ash. We are no longer Manehattan. From now on, it shall be known as the city of Tenpony!'"

TEN.96.title:0 "An Intriguing Discovery"
TEN.96.desc:0 "As Tenpony's soldiers scour the tower in ever greater numbers, reports of the guards' discoveries from their patrols are rather infrequent. Most only tell findings of hidden Society stashes or passageways a guard may stumble upon, although one particular report handed in was deemed much more significant than the others.\n\n It indicated that while patrolling through the library as per routine, one keen guard had encountered what seemed to be a hidden mechanism, blending with the rest of the library. Such a mechanism was most likely intentionally hidden, cleverly made to merge seamlessly into the scenery as its camouflage had kept it hidden from Tenpony so far.\n\n The mechanism, when triggered, reveals an entirely new section of the library that previously lied hidden and inaccessible. It no doubt holds knowledge the Society had hoped to forever keep secret."
TEN.96.a:0 "The Society thought they could keep their knowledge a secret."

TEN.97.title:0 "Dead Spring"
TEN.97.desc:0 "The winds of change were blowing. \n\nThere in the distance it stood; a tower made from steel and concrete, a testament of the old world. It survived the beating that nature had offered it over the centuries, and the horrors of a war long past; it had survived the great shockwaves released by the bombs on that fateful day, and the ensuing balefire storms that followed; while the surrounding area crumbled into rubble and sand, it remained, as if laughing in the face of time itself. But not all of the tower was untouched. Tenpony Tower’s contents were rotten. Bigoted, elitist snobs resided in the tall, defended structure. All high and mighty they thought they were. To them, it was a bubble, free of all discomforts and evils. Nothing could touch them. But bubbles are meant to pop, are they not? \n\nIt was certain; by the eve of the following day, the tower would fall. \n\nUnbeknownst to the guards surrounding the tower, a horde of ghouls, both feral and sane, were marching to the beat of a free future. They were led by Sheriff Rotting Tail, their most charismatic, and ruthless member. The ghouls had been suppressed by the scum in the tower for far too long, and were ready to turn the tides of control. Upon reaching the entrance to the passageway, one by one, they crawled in. One of them noticed a guard in the corner, sleeping on the job. Without hesitation, Rotting Tail quickly snapped the stallion’s neck and ordered the rest to continue following him. Finally, they reached the main lobby in which most residents were blissfully going about. Blissfully, until they came upon the sight of the horrid rotting ponies. Screams followed. And what followed the screams, gunshots. The security team, while highly trained, were too much in a state of shock and disgust to think properly. One mare couldn’t face the fact she may die to a ghoul, so she hurled herself out a window, and onto the dead soil of the wastes below. Within a few minutes, anyone who tried showing their face or fought back, were shot dead. The Twilight Society, in all their cowardice, fled. But, not before forgetting to hide their membership papers. Grim Star was one of the people who fled, the very stallion who wanted to murder the ghouls mercilessly before. This was self-defence. No matter if the location of the scum was unknown, they will be hunted down. There was nowhere to hide. Justice waits for no one."

He witnessed the factories, with their great pillars of smoke emerging up into the sky above. He witnessed the destructive capabilities of ponykind brought to unthinkable heights. Ultimately, he witnessed the conclusion to it all, the end of the very world itself.\n\nAfter the end, he would witness things that made even wartime Equestria seem downright utopian. The most horrible qualities of ponykind, brought out for all to see. Even as his skin rotted away and he began to resemble a corpse, the image he saw reflected in the shards of glass littering the streets was less horrifying than what went on around him. Ponies not just killing each other, but reveling in it. Some even consumed their fellow pony, engaging in an act so horrible that it was incomprehensible to the ghoul that would become known as Rawhoof.\n\nDespite all of the horrors he had witnessed, despite all of the things he had done or seen others do to survive, Rawhoof still couldn't shake a feeling of unease within the halls of Tenpony. Whispers carried through the walls, just loud enough to make out, but too faint to understand. Creaks and similar assorted noises occurred at random, echoing throughout the otherwise quiet tower. Once or twice, he swore he had heard hoofsteps moving towards him. But a frantic glance down the hall revealed nopony."

Their shadowed forms remained huddled together within one of the many side rooms that spanned across the tower, part of the secret passage network that had provided them with a refuge from the murderous ghouls that now occupied their home.\n\nOne pony in particular, a fiery young stallion by the name of First Blaze, was quick to launch back into their planning. Unlike many of the others gathered, he wasn't a true member of the Society. Just another resident willing to fight for his home and his livelihood. And for what was left of the Twilight Society, that was more than enough."

Though she certainly knew that the Tenpony Resistance and their horrid bunch were holed up somewhere, she had always thought them to be too 'sophisticated' to get a bit of blood on their hooves. An assumption which had proven to be disastrously wrong, if the corpses of her fellow ghouls were anything to go by.\n\nHer makeshift cover quickly proved its worthlessness when splinters went flying everywhere from a newly made hole. This wasn't good. This wasn't good at all. Reinforcements would surely be here soon, but if the Society were able to ambush her in what had become the makeshift command center of the tower, then where else could they be? Were any of them safe? Was even Sheriff Rotting Tail in danger, up in his renovated penthouse suite? These questions had to be answered and fast, before that damned Society could do any more damage."

As such, they made sure that it would take nothing short of an army to take it.\n\nSomething that was unexpectedly put to the test, as ponies garbed in the iconic armor of Tenpony security guards poured out of the walls. They struck quickly and efficiently, with every shot fired punching through one of our entirely unprepared ghouls. They were slow to regroup, in large part thanks to all of the patrols and checkpoints being rapidly cut off from one another. The fighting would only last for but a few minutes, as the assaulting ponies quickly occupied our own barricades surrounding the armory.\n\nThough our forces still hold the armory itself, they have found themselves entirely cut off from the rest of the tower. The halls that we had carefully set up to be meat grinders have been turned against us, with the corpses of our comrades left where they fell to remind us of what would happen if we attempted to retake our positions.\n\nUnfortunately, this has also had the effect of cutting us off from all of our supplies. All we have left are the guns and ammo that was being carried by our ghouls outside of the armory, which is hardly enough to win battles with. Until we can reclaim the armory, we will find our military to be completely crippled."

Could they begin selling off the furniture? Maybe, but he had quickly grown quite fond of the luxurious princess-sized bed which he now enjoyed. Could they begin demanding tribute from surrounding towns? Possibly, but they lacked the ghoulpower to back up any threats of violence.\n\nSuddenly, an idea struck him. Half present memories of a political crisis on Equestria's north-eastern border, long ago. A short-lived rebellion holding radical ideals. One of these ideals in particular seemed perfect, a flawless solution to their quickly impending economic failure: What if they simply did away with money? It was brilliant! Calling one of his herd over to him, he began to convey orders to be given to several ghouls across the tower. Word would have to be spread quickly, as they went about turning this half-baked idea into a radical societal change."

It will not do for us to grow to be disgusting pigs like the vile ponies that we have overthrown. To throw away our moral decency in the name of profit!\n\nTo those who even dare think that we can simply inherit this flawed and decadent system of old, we have been nothing but patient. We have allowed them to take over their businesses, to play a game of robberbaron with the workers they enslave. And make no mistake, for it is slavery. Now, our patience has run out. Now, it is time I make our stance clear.\n\nOur utopia shall be shared equally by us all. There shall be no property, no ownership, and no money. We are a society of equality, not oppression.

Black markets sprang up all across the tower, trading in everything from common commodities to contraband that had no place corrupting the minds of his herd. The workers themselves barely worked, only willing to put in the bare minimum effort to keep their armed supervisors from enacting punishment. Why wasn't anything working as it should?\n\nHalfway through drafting his seventh plan to force the success of collectivism, this time basing it off of Red Eye's Fillydelphia, he finally gave up.

The pony was apprehended by our guards, who have locked him in one of our cells for future interrogation. As for the traitor, Rotting Tail personally saw to their interrogation and execution.\n\nThe silver lining to this situation comes in the form of the information we managed to extract from both the mole in our ranks and the Resistance operative they were meeting. It seems that these fiends have access to tunnels all across our sections of the tower, tunnels which Rotting Tail has swiftly ordered to be secured.

The next, there were gunshots and blood everywhere. Ghouls poured out of one of the side tunnels, a tunnel that they had thought to have been secured. First Blaze tried to rally the ponies of the Resistance, but that also made him a target. When he went down, the rest of the already disorganized ponies began fleeing.\n\nCherry kept galloping as if her life depended on it. Mainly because it did.

He and his escort had walked right into an ambush. Everything hurt, but he was still conscious enough to feel the rope being tied around his hooves.

Every insult under the Sun and some that would be heard only in Tartarus was shouted at the ponies as they were dragged along. Objects were often thrown at them, ranging from small bits of scrap to glass bottles.\n\nAt one particularly heated point, a group of ghouls even charged the prisoners, heavily beating several of them.

TEN.133.desc:0 "The Security Council argued and debated among themselves. For the first time, they were left absent from the guiding presence of their triumphant leader. He had always attended their meetings, helping them in deciding how to move forward. His was often the only voice that truly mattered.\n\nNow he was unable to attend. To make matters even worse, Crimson was off putting down some minor riot or another in the north. This left all of the other ghouls on the Council to make one of the single most important decisions that they had ever made. They had to decide the fates of every smoothcoat in the Wasteland.\n\nLooking at eachother, the gathered ghouls reached a decision. The decision of indecision. Rather than rely on their own judgement, something which they were sorely unused to doing, they would instead use the past judgements of those wiser than them as precedent. In this way, they could both make a decision while refraining from having to bear the weight of having done so. It was brilliant!"
TEN.133.a:0 "Judgement is passed."


TEN.134.title:0 "The Ghoulish Slavemasters"
TEN.134.desc:0 "Ghouls all across Manehatten cheered as word quickly spread all throughout their great utopian nation. The final judgement had been passed by the wise protectors who comprised the Security Council. Those bigoted living creatures that had oppressed and prosecuted ghoulkind for so long had their fates sealed, their status within this utopia determined now and forever.\n\nPonies, griffon, and zebra alike would all enjoy an equal status within this society. Regardless of their race, faith, or creed all those who still enjoyed intact feathers or fur would be equally enslaved by their new masters. In this way, they would be given a chance at redemption. An opportunity to make up for their own sins and the sins of their ancestors. Only in this way could justice be brought about.\n\nOf course, some expressed doubts regarding this course of action. They spoke of morality and hypocrisy. Of right and wrong. These few were mostly ignored, save for by the respected members of our revolutionary army, who watched them all the closer. Such dissent would not do within our perfect utopia."
TEN.134.a:0 "The new slave masters rise."


TEN.135.title:0 "The Ghoulish Reapers"
TEN.135.desc:0 "The Day of Judgement, as it would be known for years to come, began with a few gunshots ringing out in the early hours of the morning. It wouldn't be long at all before this escalated far beyond just a few stray shots into all out constant gunfire. From the northernmost outskirts to the southernmost ruins, Manehatten was overtaken by the sounds of justice. When judgement wasn't brought about through a bullet, it was instead brought with a rope, a blade, or even just bare hooves. The ghouls who had been oppressed for so long, who had been forced to flee time and time again, were taking out their collective wrath against those who had wronged them.\n\nEntire towns of smoothcoats that had thought themselves safe quickly had their sense of security shattered as their precious homes were razed to the ground. Even those rats hiding within the abandoned tunnels running under the city found themselves forced out into the light, where our soldiers awaited them. The decision had been made that none of the living were to survive, for Manehatten would be a city of and for the dead.\n\nThose few ghouls who dared to speak out against the ongoing violence were quickly labeled as traitors. For daring to place the lives of these oppressors over the lives of their own comrades, they were made to join the piles of the dead. After all, those who do not stand alongside the revolution stand against it."
TEN.135.a:0 "We are the smoothcoat's worst nightmare."


TEN.136.title:0 "A Prosperous Utopia"
TEN.136.desc:0 "Our efforts to collectivize had succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. The old flawed system of hierarchy and capitalistic allocation of wealth had been entirely replaced with a new far superior system of communal equality. Even the concept of the bottlecap itself had been destroyed, leading to those bits of metal being regarded as just that. They held no value within a society that rejected open markets.\n\nThis had also had the effect of bringing all of us closer together. Everyghoul shared with one another freely and completely, acting as if we were all just one big family. Our society had become one based on the merits of helping your fellow ghoul, with the entire community aiding in every affair. From building a new home to maintaining our roads, it was expected that every member of the community would contribute. And they did!\n\nIt truly was the ideal utopia."
TEN.136.a:0 "No Goddesses, No Mistresses."


TEN.137.title:0 "Debates Have Started"
TEN.137.desc:0 "The Tower Assembly gathered and chattered, debating among themselves about the merit of this latest proposal. Already, political factions had formed surrounding the question that had been brought before them. They argued with one another, making proposals and counterproposals. Many inspiring and passionate speeches were made in favor of each side. However, it wasn't enough. At the end of the day, the Assembly was no closer to reaching a decision as it was at the beginning. It would be many more similar sessions before a final conclusion was reached."

It went through many rewrites and redesigns, many changes and compromises, but at the end of the day it was forced into a form that was agreeable to enough ghouls to get it passed. Truly, the merits of democracy have never been more evident than today. This amazing accomplishment will go down in the history books as one of the greatest to ever be achieved, a society-changing decision that will benefit us all for generations to come. Praise be our Assembly!"

It seems that not even the most dedicated efforts of our most passionate supporters could shift the viewpoints of their fellow ghouls enough to carry the motion forward."
TEN.139.a:0 "How could this happen?!"


TEN.141.title:0 "Enact Conscription?"
TEN.141.desc:0 "It is a sad reality that our struggle will not be won with hopes and dreams alone. If we wish to throw off the chains of oppression which have bound us for so long and achieve a long-lasting revolution of the ghoul class against the hateful entitled ponies which seek to keep us down, we have little other choice than to fight with bodies and bullets. Unfortunately, we are sorely lacking in the earlier of those two.\n\nA simple solution to that simple problem is to introduce conscription. After all, isn't it the duty of our ghouls to give their lives in the name of our utopian dreams? However, this is regarded by many as being a distasteful policy. It would likely prove to be highly controversial, and many of our ghouls may openly express their dissent at being forced to take arms in our defence."
TEN.141.a:0 "How shall we proceed?"


TEN.142.title:0 "Yes, We Can!"
TEN.142.desc:0 "When we had announced the enactment of conscription, we had done so with a great deal of fear regarding the reaction our ghouls would have to such a measure. These fears it seems were unfounded, as our new policy has been embraced with open hooves. Ghouls flock to our military from all parts, embracing their duty to the revolution. It seems everyghoul truly is willing to die if it means bringing about the utopia of our dreams."
TEN.142.a:0 "Great outcome!"


TEN.143.title:0 "No, You Can't!"
TEN.143.desc:0 "We knew that the enactment of conscription would be controversial, but we had never imagined it would be responded to this viciously. Protests are now occurring all across our territory, with ghouls from all walks of life and filling all roles speaking out against us for what they claim to be a severe violation of the common rights that everyghoul possesses. Even our soldiers are throwing down their arms and refusing to fight any more until we back down on this tyrannical policy. It seems we have little choice but to pull back on our conscription efforts."
TEN.143.a:0 "Damn it all!"


TEN.144.title:0 "Perfect Balance"
TEN.144.desc:0 "Messy couldn't even hear herself think over all of the noise. From the endless clanking of chains to the constant gunfire and panicked screaming, it was hard to concentrate on the paperwork in front of her. Each and every one of the new slaves had to be catalogued and organized, a process which she had the misfortune of overseeing. An entire city's worth of slaves! How could she be expected to keep track of them all?\n\nAnother gunshot, another dead pony. At least the dead didn't need to be counted. Though really, would it kill them to try to keep the racket down?\n\nThe slight burn in her lungs snapped Messy away from her paperwork. Looking around, she quickly identified the source as being smoke blowing it from her paneless window. It seems the fires had already started, meant to burn bodies and homes alike. A distasteful measure, but a necessary one.\n\nGiving up on getting any work done, Messy left her desk and stormed out of her makeshift office. She would have to see to it that the slaves were counted later, as these conditions were just completely unworkable."
TEN.144.a:0 "Shackle and bullet alike are the instruments of justice."


TEN.145.title:0 "The Arrival of Justice"
TEN.145.desc:0 "The easily recognizable half-growl of Sheriff Rotting Tail transmitted through the Tenpony Intercom System, broadcasting to the entirety of the tower. Many ghouls stopped and paid the voice of their leader their total attention, and all of the admittedly few still-hiding ponies did so as well. Hope and dread filled the respective audiences' minds, as they listened to the news of the ghoul's victory.\n\n'My fellow ghouls, I have come to announce to you our victory over the oppressors of Tenpony. The Resistance - a pathetic pack of ratlike ponies who thought to strike at us from their little holes - and the remnants of their once oh so noble Security forces have both been brought low. Many of the leaders of the Resistance are dead or in our possession, awaiting trial for their crimes. Even better, Grim Star himself has been captured by our bravest soldiers. I personally will make sure that he gets what he deserves, that biggoted bucker.'\n\nThe news of their grand victory was met with cheers from all across Tenpony Tower. At the same time, if one were to listen very closely, they could hear panicked whispering and rampant defeatism spreading throughout the still undiscovered little crevices and secret sections of the ancient tower."
TEN.145.a:0 "This is where the fun begins."


TEN.146.title:0 "Secrets of the Past"
TEN.146.desc:0 "Rotting Tail had never been one for books. Sure, he had read from time to time in his youth, but it had never been a dominant pastime for the old ghoul. Nowadays, his sight was too poor for him to make out the words, taking that choice away from him entirely. As a result, it was rare to see him within the confines of Tenpony's fairly extensive library. Indeed, it was rare to see anyghoul between the dust-covered bookshelves, as there was far too much work to be done to spend time on something as frivolous as reading.\n\n However, one of his ghouls had found something. While on patrol, that lazy maggot-ridden zombie had snuck off to read books instead of doing his duty to the revolution. In doing so, he ended up accidentally pulling a hidden switch cleverly disguised as an unassuming book. Why that ghoul felt 'Grass Growing and You!: A Lawnkeeper's Guide to A Better Lawn' was an entertaining read, Rotting Tail would never know.\n\nRegardless, he had managed to stumble across a previously hidden section of the library. It had already been sweeped and secured, seemingly left abandoned by even the Resistance. Now, all that was left to do was to see what was inside."
TEN.146.a:0 "Let's see what else these bastards have been hiding."


TEN.147.title:0 "The Storming of MASEBS"
TEN.147.desc:0 "The gathered ghouls all looked nervously at one another. Before them, a blinking light informed them that they were outside of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences Emergency Broadcasting System room, which was apparently currently broadcasting. They knew that there could be anything on the other side, from an arcane super weapon to an entire army of Resistance fighters. Despite that, they had little choice but to steel themselves and prepare for when the door to the hidden passage they sat within opened.\n\nThey had two primary goals. Firstly, securing the MASEBS itself. Doing so would allow them to transmit their message of revolution across the entirety of the Wasteland. Doing so would go a long ways towards helping them spread word of the utopia which they sought to create, drawing ghouls from all around to aid them in their struggle.\n\nSecondly, they aimed to capture DJ Pon3 and his assistant, Homage. The latter in particular was a known leader of the Resistance, having helped coordinate and even conduct many of the strikes against them in the futile attempt to drive the ghouls out of Tenpony. The DJ's involvement was as of now unknown, but given Homage's status as his assistant, it was expected that he was directly involved with the Resistance as well. Possibly even the primary leader of it? Whatever the case, they would soon find out..."
TEN.147.a:0 "Let's do this!"


TEN.148.title:0 "Broadcast the Message"
TEN.148.desc:0 "It was to Rotting Tail's great pleasure that the MASEBS was successfully captured. The Resistance put up little fight to keep it, perhaps having been unprepared for the attack or perhaps having simply decided that it wasn't a high priority. Now, the ghouls could broadcast their ideals far and wide, ensuring that the entirety of the Equestrian heartland and perhaps even beyond could hear of their utopia.\n\nUnfortunately, DJ Pon3 and his assistant had not been found within the broadcasting studio. Whether their absence was intentional or a coincidence is unknown, but they had simply left a recording playing and had vacated the area entirely. A ponyhunt has already been called to search for them, but it's unlikely that we'll ever manage to find them if they're within the labyrinthian network of secret rooms and tunnels that stretches across Tenpony."
TEN.148.a:0 "Spread the idea!"


TEN.149.title:0 "Failure!"
TEN.149.desc:0 "Rotting Tail's fury represented itself in the form of a hoof slamming directly into the face of the ghoul unfortunate enough to have been the messenger. As his comrade slammed into the floor, the leader of the revolution roared in anger. Those foals! Those absolute bucking foals!\n\nWhen they had tried to secure the MASEBS, they had been met with... a locked door. The switch that opened their secret passage simply didn't function. In face of such intimidating opposition, they had been cowered into inaction. To the point where they did nothing but wait in the vain hope that someone would open it from the other side, up until a great rumbling could be felt across the entire tower.\n\nWhen the door did finally open, it was to reveal nothing but rubble from where the MASEBS used to be. The entire broadcasting studio had been destroyed, collapsed with explosives. The floor immediately above had also caved in onto it, covering it with bits of debris.\n\nSuch failure, all due to nothing but the hesitance and incompetence of a bunch of cowards! No matter. The revolution would progress, with or without a radio station to spread word of it."
TEN.149.a:0 "Just one setback..."


TEN.150.title:0 "A Comrade's Fate"
TEN.150.desc:0 "The Security Council and Assembly alike had gathered for what may be the most tragic event that any of them had ever witnessed. Before them crouched the hunched form of Sheriff Rotting Tail, his iconic hat still firmly on his head despite his constant twitching and animalistic behavior. All attempts to talk to him had failed, all attempts to even get him to respond had failed, and when he had bitten a chunk out of the ghoul who had the idea to keep prodding him with a stick until he returned to them. There was nothing else for it: Rotting Tail had gone feral.\n\nNow, it fell to those ghouls who were entrusted with guiding Tenpony into the future to deal with their former comrade. They debated among themselves, arguing back and forth as to where to go from here and how to handle the feral in the room. Their debating would continue into the late hours of the night, as they struggled to find a way forward without their beloved leader there to guide them..."
TEN.150.a:0 "It seems his time has run out."

TEN.151.title:0 "Put Him Down"
TEN.151.desc:0 "Crimson found the rain to be appropriate for the tone that was in the air. He had been the one to be selected to oversee the execution of Rotting Tail, though the others refused to call it that. Most of them weren't even in attendance, claiming that they couldn't handle watching such a tragic event. It was almost pathetic.\n\nYet, as the former revolutionary's feral form was gently guided to a wall, Crimson felt a spike of sorrow strike through him. He had never really liked the Sheriff. Not before his little uprising and certainly not after. He couldn't help but to respect him and his accomplishments though. It was undeniable that they would all be watching the death of a remarkable and inspiring individual.\n\nOne of the guards attempts to get a lit cigarette into his former leader's mouth was met with failure, as the animal that had once been Rotting Tail simply ate the entire thing. The Liberator of Manehatten was never known to be a particularly religious ghoul, and so all further ceremony was skipped as Crimson provided the orders he was entrusted to give.\n\n'Ready. Aim. Fire.'"
TEN.151.a:0 "Farewell, comrade."

TEN.152.title:0 "Follow the Madness"
TEN.152.desc:0 "For so long now, we have followed the shining example of Sheriff Rotting Tail. We only knew his will, only knew his dream, and only followed his vision. Why would that change now?\n\nLow growls and shrieking howls filled the air all across the city of Manehatten. Thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of rotting forms flooded the streets. They carried with them nothing short of animalistic fury, expressed in the violent destruction of the land around them. Buildings were torn down, creatures were eaten alive, and those non-ghouls hiding within the City of the Dead were tracked down to be slaughtered. It was a display of pure violence, a return to a primal state.\n\nThe leader of it all, the one who they all sought to mimic, stood atop the decrepit tower that had once belonged to the living. By pure instinct, he joined the howls with his own, a final note that perfected the symphony which blanketed Manehatten. Though he comprehended nothing of what was going on, his was the most important voice to this orchestra of the damned. It was his voice, his will, which was being relayed across the city and beyond."

POLITICS_GRIMSTAR_DESC:0 "Chief Grim Star is, depending on who you ask, either the hero to save Tenpony or the villain to destroy it. His coup was as unexpected as it was drastic, though he would describe it as entirely necessary. Now, he stands alone as the leader of all of Tenpony Tower. His ambitions stretch far beyond the simple confines of the tower's luxurious walls, with his ultimate goal being the unification and restoration of all of Manehatten."

POLITICS_SHERIFFROTTING_DESC:0 "Though it is rude to bring up ones mental state when discussing politics, you would be a foal not to notice the many feral tendencies which Sheriff Rotting Tail exhibits. From the constant growl in his voice to his calls for extreme violence, there are many red flags which have led to even his own ghouls doubting his leadership.\n\nDespite this, the fiery zeal that Rotting Tail possesses has rallied many ghouls to his side. In him, they see a hope for a better future. One free of discrimination, of oppression, and of being at a disadvantage. It is their hope that someday they may have a ghoul nation to call their own, one where everyghoul may be free to live their life how they choose."

POLITICS_TWILIGHTSOCIETY_DESC:0 "The Twilight Society are the mysterious and secretive organization that controls Tenpony Tower from behind the scenes. Very few ponies outside of their society even know of their existence, with the majority of Tenpony's residents believing that the 'Tenpony Administration' is in charge instead.\n\nThe Society itself was founded by remnants of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences following the violent end to the Great War. Since then, they have maintained their mission of preserving knowledge so that it may never be forgotten.\n\nIn recent times, their role within the Wasteland has been brought into question. Idealists within their ranks speak of abandoning their commitment to neutrality in greater Wasteland affairs and instead striking out to help their fellow pony. All the while, other ponies both within and outside of Tenpony pursue their own ambitions at the Society's expense.\n\nThe future is uncertain for the Twilight Society. Only time will tell whether or not they continue to survive into the future."
