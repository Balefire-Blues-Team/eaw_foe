### Opening Focuses ###
TEN_ministry_hub:0 "The MAS Ministry Hub"
TEN_ministry_hub_desc:0 "The Manehatten Hub of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences was at the center of all of their operations within the Manehatten region. The building it was located in, known as Tenpony Tower, also served as a civilian hotel, which was used as a front for the Hub itself."

TEN_the_war:0 "The Damaged Tower"
TEN_the_war_desc:0 "Despite the various reinforcements and magical wards placed on Tenpony Tower, the building still suffered substantial damage during the end of the world. While much of this damage has been repaired over the past couple of centuries, some scars still remain. "

TEN_communication:0 "Outside Communications"
TEN_communication_desc:0 "The residents of Tenpony couldn’t just hide away in their tower forever. Eventually, they had to venture out into the ruins of Manehatten, where various dangers and horrors awaited them."

### The Library ###
TEN_library:0 "Twilight Sparkle's Athenaeum"
TEN_library_desc:0 "Twilight Sparkle was a known collector and preserver of books. Just about every MAS Hub was home to at least one stash of books, and our own was home to much more than one."

TEN_Banned_section:0 "Banned Section"
TEN_Banned_section_desc:0 "Among Twilight’s books were many relating to waging war. While these books won’t be available to the general public, they will be very useful in training our security forces."

TEN_Unicorn_tech:0 "Lethal Unicorn Spells"
TEN_Unicorn_tech_desc:0 "Basic combat spells are common across the Wasteland. However, more complex spells have been all but forgotten since the end of the War. Fortunately for us, we are now in possession of several books on just that topic."

TEN_weapon_tech:0 "Prototype Weapon Blueprints"
TEN_weapon_tech_desc:0 "The Ministry Mare was dedicated to preserving knowledge in all of its forms. To our surprise, this also included things such as schematics and blueprints,  most notably relating to various weaponry."

TEN_military_section:0 "Military Tactic Section"
TEN_military_section_desc:0 "Military history has been all but lost to the recesses of time. Until now, that is. Armed with the knowledge of hundreds of defeats and victories from battles from the far past, we can effectively analyze and improve upon our own strategies."

TEN_army_doctrine:0 "Army Tactics"
TEN_army_doctrine_desc:0 "Armies form the foundation of any successful military. From Equestria’s armies during the Great War, to the ancient armies of the Griffonian Empire, there are many we can learn from regarding how to most effectively use our infantry."

TEN_navy_doctrine:0 "Naval Tactics"
TEN_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "The Equestrian Navy was once the mightiest force to sail the seas. They had the largest fleets, the most advanced ships, and the most developed doctrines. We could do well to learn from it."

TEN_air_doctrine:0 "Air Tactics"
TEN_air_doctrine_desc:0 "The idea of air domination was not invented during the Great War. To the contrary, the idea had been around for as long as races capable of flight have existed. Though we may not have wings, we can still study the tactics and methods of the pegasi and griffons in order to develop our own air doctrines."

TEN_public_section:0 "Public Library"
TEN_public_section_desc:0 "Many of the books that we have now freely shared with the public could be very useful in our own pursuits. Engineering, mathematics, arcane theory, and all other manners of knowledge could be very useful indeed."

TEN_robotics_section:0 "Robotic Section"
TEN_robotics_section_desc:0 "Robotics was a relatively new field within wartime Equestria. Reviving this field could be the key to revolutionize our armies and industry alike. "

TEN_industry_section:0 "Industrial Section"
TEN_industry_section_desc:0 "Equestria was undergoing an industrial revolution during the War. Rapid advancements allowed for production on a scale only dreamed of in the past. By learning from their production methods, we could unlock the secrets of mass production."

TEN_engineering_section:0 "Engineering Section"
TEN_engineering_section_desc:0 "Engineering is an art thought long lost. With the knowledge we have now, we could revive the field as a whole. Electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineering alike can be revived in the Wasteland. We even have books on environmental engineering!"

TEN_ideology_books:0 "Ideology Books"
TEN_ideology_books_desc:0 "The Ministry Mare hated to see any books destroyed, even those containing seditious material. She made an effort to preserve these books, and was rumored to have received a copy of each book destroyed by the Ministry of Image. Now, this leaves us with many of those books deemed too dangerous to be available to the public."

TEN_burn_books:0 "Burn the Books!"
TEN_burn_books_desc:0 "We can not allow such seditious ideas to poison the minds of our ponies! Just as the Ministry of Image did during the War, we shall censor and destroy that knowledge which poses a threat to our way of being."

TEN_Release_books:0 "Release the books"
TEN_Release_books_desc:0 "Knowledge should be shared freely, regardless of whether or not it agrees with our worldview. While some ponies could begin to advocate for radical ideals, that is a risk we must take in our dedication to preserving knowledge."

TEN_ghoul_problem:0 "Ghoul Problem"
TEN_ghoul_problem_desc:0 "There’s a group of ghouls who have been causing trouble for us as of late. They’ll need to be dealt with, in one way or another."

TEN_hire_mercenaries:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
TEN_hire_mercenaries_desc:0 "The Twilight Society is hesitant to take action against the ghouls. Chief Grim Star has realized that he must go around them if he wishes to render the ghouls a non-issue."

Not a month goes by that we don't receive reports of ponies who stumble across unknown rooms with sometimes unknown creatures as well. However, a recent discovery showed that, with a bit of luck, one can find true gold mines."

TEN_unusual_find:0 "An Unusual Find"
TEN_unusual_find_desc:0 "Deep within the Hub resides a door with more wards and security than anywhere else within the entire tower. Who knows what could be behind it?"

TEN_real_society:0 "The Twilight Society"
TEN_real_society_desc:0 "The Twilight Society is the secretive ruling council of Tenpony. Though the public believes that the Tenpony Administration is in charge, they are little more than a front for the Twilight Society itself. They have ruled the tower since the War ended, and consider themselves the successors to the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. "

TEN_protect_celestia_line:0 "Protect the Celestia Line"
TEN_protect_celestia_line_desc:0 "Manehatten’s Celestia Line offers both a valuable trade route and an easy method to travel across the city. We must secure, protect, and maintain it if we wish to put it to use."

TEN_gutterville_scrap:0 "Gutterville Scrap"
TEN_gutterville_scrap_desc:0 "Gutterville is a small settlement of scavengers struggling to get by in the ruins of Manehatten. While they may be a bit less civilized than our own residents, they know the city like the back of their hooves. By working with them, we can find all sorts of usable material."

TEN_economy_issue:0 "Dwindling Financial Budget"
TEN_economy_issue_desc:0 "Our economy is very import based. Right now, everything works fine, but what if our trade partners turn against us, or get conquered by someone who doesn't have our best in mind? Keeping our current course is too much of a risk and we need to be more self-sustaining."

TEN_import_prewar_food:0 "Import Cheap Pre-war food"
TEN_import_prewar_food_desc:0 "Despite being hundreds of years old, most pre-war Equestrian food is still edible. And even though it tastes like it as well, it's cheap and it has all the nutrients a pony needs."

TEN_import_meat_Arbu:0 "Import Radigator meat from Arbu"
TEN_import_meat_Arbu_desc:0 "The small town of Arbu is well-known for its Radigator meat. It is said to be fresh, healthy, and delicious, even though it tastes a bit weird sometimes. It may not be our cheapest food source, but it's definitely better than that old pre-war food."

TEN_restaurant_recipes:0 "Restaurant Recipes"
TEN_restaurant_recipes_desc:0 "Due to the rising complaints about the meals tasting worse than, I quote, "my dead grandmother's hooves", our chefs desperately looked for a way to please the ponies, while keeping the food still cheap. Luckily, they found a few cookbooks, and their meals taste like nothing now, which is an improvement."

TEN_elite_cuisine:0 "Elite Cuisine"
TEN_elite_cuisine_desc:0 "In the past months, our best chefs tried every possibility, to make the already great Radigator meat even more delicious. After countless nights of experiments with all sorts of ingredients, they have gathered dozens of recipes, and our cuisine is known throughout the entire wasteland, for its manifold ways of preparing the precious meat. "

TEN_support_local_merchants:0 "Support Local Merchants"
TEN_support_local_merchants_desc:0 "We have finally solved our food problem. The main reason why we had to deal with it in the first place was that we were relying too much on foreign countries. It's only reasonable that we support domestic businesses over foreign ones."

TEN_attract_foreign_merchants:0 "Attract Foreign Merchants"
TEN_attract_foreign_merchants_desc:0 "We have finally secured a stable and reliable food source, and by attracting foreign merchants, we could get a nice little bonus. Some fear that we will rely on imports again, but this time, we have a food source to keep us alive in times of need."

TEN_military_contracts:0 "Sign Military Contracts"
TEN_military_contracts_desc:0 "A worker is useless if he has no factory to work in in the first place. Luckily, some foreign gunsmiths and companies have shown interest in us, and they are willing to invest in building a factory."

TEN_increase_wages:0 "Increase Worker Wages"
TEN_increase_wages_desc:0 "A worker does not work because of his loyalty to Tenpony, but rather because of the money we pay him. This means, that if we pay him badly, he works less and eventually moves to a place with higher wages. So why not give the workers a little pay rise, to show them our appreciation?"

TEN_recovering_economy:0 "Recovering Economy"
TEN_recovering_economy_desc:0 "After months and months of hard work, we not only got our economy back on track, but we have become a major power as well. We can finally move on to spread our sphere of influence and compete with the rest of the wasteland."

TEN_contact_gutterville_settlement:0 "Make Contact with Gutterville"
TEN_contact_gutterville_settlement_desc:0 "While we’ve already begun cooperating with the residents of Gutterville, we have neglected to contact their leadership thus far. In the interest of furthering our involvement with their settlement, it would do us well to send an envoy to whoever they consider their leader."

TEN_guard_gutterville:0 "Guard Gutterville"
TEN_guard_gutterville_desc:0 "Gutterville has been plagued by nothing but trouble throughout its entire history. Raiders, manticores, rogue spritebots, and more have constantly threatened the residents of the shantytown. We shall send our own security forces to protect their town, and keep their residents safe from all that would threaten them."

TEN_clear_MoM_hub:0 "Clear the MoM Hub"
TEN_clear_MoM_hub_desc:0 "The Ministry of Morale’s Hub is the source of the seemingly endless swarm of spritebots that have relentlessly attacked Gutterville since it was first founded. The rogue robots seem to be stuck on their security protocols, and are very aggressively carrying out their duties. If we wish to get at what’s inside the Hub, we must first begin by wiping out the machines that guard it."

TEN_scavenge_MoM:0 "Scavenge the MoM hub"
TEN_scavenge_MoM_desc:0 "There surely must be more robots where the ones we destroyed came from. Stored inside the MoM hub, inactive, and waiting to be used one day. It would be a miracle if these didn't work anymore, and by selling all their different parts, we could make a small fortune.”

TEN_fortify_MoM:0 "Fortify the MoM hub"
TEN_fortify_MoM_desc:0 "There surely must be more robots where the ones we destroyed came from. So it's maybe not the worst idea to keep them locked inside of the MoM hub for good. The hub is a large building, so instead of scavenging what's inside, we should spend our few resources on turning it into a huge fortress."

TEN_form_MTC:0 "Form the MTC"
TEN_form_MTC_desc:0 "We have finally secured the situation on the 'home front', as the pre-war Equestrians said, and we are now in a position to expand our sphere of influence. We have already expanded our grasp on our neighbors, so they would be a good start."

TEN_invite_Gutterville:0 "Invite Gutterville"
TEN_invite_Gutterville_desc:0 "We have assisted Gutterville greatly in the past, and it's now time that they give us something in return. We already have enough soldiers and equipment, but what we do lack is an ally."

TEN_Gutterville_workposts:0 "Set Up Scavenger Workposts"
TEN_Gutterville_workposts_desc:0 "The scavengers of Gutterville may be experienced, but they are also largely disorganized. By organizing them into work units and creating a system for choosing which ruins to scavenge, we can greatly increase their efficiency."

TEN_tackle_manticores:0 "Tackle Manticore Problem"
TEN_tackle_manticores_desc:0 "Manticore’s have been a persistent problem within Manehattan. It’s about time that we find their breeding grounds so we can deal with them once and for all."

TEN_help_marelem:0 "Send help to Marelem"
TEN_help_marelem_desc:0 "Our Western neighbors, Marelam, are about as large as us, but much weaker. In fact, they are so weak, that they can't even defend themselves against the Manehattan raiders. We, however, have the means to help them and it would be unfair if we didn't. Perhaps we can profit from it too."

TEN_protect_marelem:0 "Protect Marelem"
TEN_protect_marelem_desc:0 "Those raiders are tougher than we expected. But it sounds worse than it actually is, since we only sent a small garrison to Marelem. It's time we show them our full force."

TEN_boost_marelem:0 "Boost Marelem's Economy"
TEN_boost_marelem_desc:0 "Due to those raiders, Marelem was never able to build up a proper industry, since every new factory would have been immediately destroyed. However, the Raiders are now history, and with some financial incentive, Marelem's large and empty fields can finally experience what civilization looks like."

TEN_deal_with_MRA:0 "Deal with the Manehatten Raiders"
TEN_deal_with_MRA_desc:0 "It's time we finally deal with those raiders once and for all. For far too long, we're trying to cast them out of our lands, and it's starting to get embarrassing. A final demonstration of force should show Equus, that we can handle a few raiders with ease."

TEN_raiderwar_aftermath:0 "Aftermath of the Raider war"
TEN_raiderwar_aftermath_desc:0 "The land we have taken from the raiders is practically useless. Sheer endless, barren and sparsely habited wastelands with no proper use for us. By giving one or two provinces to our little ally, it would be the perfect opportunity for him to prove himself, wouldn't it?"

TEN_invite_marelem:0 "Invite Marelem"
TEN_invite_marelem_desc:0 "While Marelem is practically under our protection, we never signed any form of a formal agreement. Surely, the ponies would never refuse such a treaty, considering all the benefits they would receive by staying with us. And if they think they don't need our help, then that's fine by us too."

TEN_fetlock_autonomy:0 "Give Fetlock Some Autonomy"
TEN_fetlock_autonomy_desc:0 "The little town of Fetlock has shown to be a little problem recently. Apparently, its citizens see us as oppressors and some even started to violently revolt against our rule. Fetlock isn't really worth fighting for, so why not accommodate those rebels a bit and give them some formal autonomy?"

TEN_grim_star_doctrine:0 "Grim Star's Doctrine"
TEN_grim_star_doctrine_desc:0 "The best of the best. That’s what our ponies must be. We shall win battles through merit and skill, rather than through numbers."

TEN_soldier_training:0 "Soldier Training"
TEN_soldier_training_desc:0 "A soldier not only needs a gun, but he also needs to know his way around it. And while baptism of fire is an option as well, we are not the type of ponies to willingly sacrifice our comrades in combat just to save a few bottle caps, are we?"

TEN_medkit_research:0 "First Aid Kits"

TEN.1.title:0 "The MAS hub"
TEN.1.desc:0 "Tenpony Tower. A luxury hotel, known for housing the Ministry of Arcane Science's Manehatten Hub. When Balefire began raining from the sky, those ponies working within the Hub were some of the first to know. Orders came in from Canterlot to fire the prototype megaspell Celestia One at Roam, capital of the Zebra empire. Knowing that Manehatten would be a primary target, the ponies of the Ministry had to make a choice. They could follow their orders and focus on casting the megaspell, or ignore their orders and focus on using the Manehatten Emergency Broadcasting System to warn the residents of the city. There wouldn't be enough time to do both, and the seconds were ticking down."
TEN.1.a:0 "Sound the Emergency Broadcast System"
TEN.1.b:0 "Fire Celestia One!"

TEN.2.title:0 "Walls of Balefire"
TEN.2.desc:0 "Tenpony Tower was able to survive the wrath of the Balefire bombs thanks to a series of thick steel walls that coat the MAS hub, unfortunately it was still heavily damaged with the outer walls ripped apart and not a single window survived the shockwave. Soon after irradiated air seeped into the tower. A group of volunteers had requested that they take their protective suits from their labs and go out to repair and fortify the outer walls. Another group had proposed that they’d leave the outer walls to be used as a trap for Ghouls and other abominations and instead focused on fortifying the still functional inner walls."
TEN.2.a:0 "Repair the outer wall"
TEN.2.b:0 "Fortify the inner walls"

TEN.3.title:0 "Outside Communication"
TEN.3.desc:0 "The years following the Balefire were harsh, even to the relatively lucky occupants of Tenpony Tower. The Tower was never stocked to be a long-term survival shelter, and the M.A.S.'s emergency provisions would only last so long. As a result, the ponies within rapidly found themselves running out of food and supplies alike. So, the moment the radiation levels outside were deemed "acceptable", a scavenging expedition was launched to obtain crucial supplies. However, the ponies of this expedition quickly found that they were not the only ones within the devastated ruins of Manehatten. They found a nearby settlement, built with scrap on top of old ruins. Upon getting closer to the settlement, they were shocked to find it full of the undead! The expedition backed away and considered their options. They could attempt to approach these things and see if they were willing to trade. Alternatively, they put an end to these abominations and take all they have. After all, what need do the dead have for food?"
TEN.3.a:0 "Try approaching the zombies."
TEN.3.b:0 "Make the dead stay dead."

TEN.4.title:0 "Ghoul Problem"
TEN.4.desc:0 "Life in our tower was very serene, safe and calm (for those who had the caps), but it seems that peace can come to an end. One of our major Wasteland product suppliers has provided us with valuable information regarding the ghoul population in Manehattan. Namely, about a large settlement of zombies near our tower. It's amazing how they have not attacked us yet, given the carelessness and the unreadiness of our guard to defend against massive enemy groups. Let it be just ghouls, but the problem of their unwanted neighborhood next to us needs a solution. To begin with, first of all, a worthy intelligence is required to be one hundred percent sure that this is reliable information, and at the same time, to find out how many ghouls can potentially attack us."
TEN.4.a:0 "Send out some of our Officers to investigate"

TEN.5.title:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
TEN.5.desc:0 "Grim Star sat in his office, pondering what he heard. A huge accumulation of ghouls by the standards of the wasteland. Let them be more or less reasonable, their leader was clearly close to becoming feral. The unicorn did not see a way out of the situation, except to conclude a contract with Blackwing's Talons, hoping that they would restrain the onslaught in the event of an attack. Or help deliver a preemptive strike. While smoking a smoldering cigarette, he turned his gaze out the window, looking at the ruins of skyscrapers, cracked paved highways and the rusted remains of the Celestia line. He decided to secretly hire a band of griffins, so as not to incur the wrath of his superiors, who are forever against widespread cooperation with the outside world. And who are against paying Talons to do the dirty work. Grim Star is not afraid of possible anger from the Twilight Society, or to spend a lot of his own caps. He sees the meaning of his existence only in that Tenpony stood forever, being the beacon of civilization in the Wasteland of Equestria, and saw the only way out of this situation only in mercenaries. And so, throwing away the cigarette butt as it burned his lips , he decided."

TEN.6.title:0 "The Star fell and crashed"
TEN.6.desc:0 "What was I hoping for? What would they praise me for, or would they pat me on the head with a hoof?" — Grim Star mentally scrolled in his head the events of the contract, thinking who could know about it. Everything went wrong at the last moment. As soon as he left the meeting place with Blackwing's talons, a security guard twisted it and reported the incident to the Twilight Society, in hopes of taking the place of Grim Star as Head of Security. The Society confined themselves not to expulse Grim Star from the Tower, but only to temporary arrest, and the deprivation of his post. However, Grim Star did not feel betrayed. He has done his duty as conscientiously as possible, concluding a contract with the Talons, which is very necessary for the weakened guard of the Tower. Now, he could sleep peacefully, knowing that his work was not wasted, let no one thank him."
TEN.6.a:0 "He will learn to consult the Society next time."

TEN.7.title:0 "Ghouls slaughtered"
TEN.7.desc:0 "Grim Star has hired Blackwing's talons to take out the Ghoul Sherrif Rottingtail who is slowly going mad. Blackwing's talons tried taking out Rottingtail quietly but it failed and the ghouls attack Blackwing's talons. Forcing them to take out all the ghouls. "

Ghouls are ponies who have had the misfortune of soaking up a major dose of magical radiation and not dying. That stuff twists and rots their bodies, but unlike zombies, their minds are still like those of any other pony, and they deserve t’ be treated as such.\"\n\n\"Well, some of you ponies up in Tenpony Tower didn’t get the message. And when Sheriff Rottingtail kept pressin’ for him and his ghouls t’ be allowed inside, just cuz they were sick of being hounded by manticores an’ slaughtered by bloodwings, Chief Grim Star, the head of Tenpony security, responded by hiring a bunch of mercenaries to scour the tenements along the Celestia Line and wipe them all out.""

TEN.10.title:0 "Opening of the Tenpony Library"
TEN.10.desc:0 "We are happy to announce the opening of the new Twilight Sparkle Library! The Library is both a place of learning for our residents and a monument to the Ministry Mare herself and her life's work.\n\nLocated at the far end of the commercial district, the Library will operate during standard daytime hours, Monday through Saturday. All residents are granted free entry and rentals, though outsiders are expected to pay a small fee for such.\n\nIt will also host books from Twilight Sparkle's own personal collection. Much of this rare literature has not been available to the public since before The War itself and has, until now, been lost to time.\n\nWe hope our valued residents will make use of and enjoy this new facility. Have a good day, and happy reading!\n\n- The Tenpony Tower Administration."
TEN.10.a:0 "Knowledge is finally being restored to the wasteland."

TEN.11.title:0 "Pre-war books found"
TEN.11.desc:0 "While walking around Twilight's Athenaeum, one of our ponies discovered a hidden section behind some bookshelves - upon further investigation, they have found many books telling about relationships between Ponies and Zebras along with many books with a "BANNED" or "CENSORED" typed out on them. Looks like Ministry of Image didn't want this to show up in the open..."
TEN.11.a:0 "We have found the forbidden knowledge."

TEN.12.title:0 "DJ Pon3's Broadcast"
TEN.12.desc:0 "In an interview, when asked how he had managed to be such a supreme douche bag, Chief Grim Star had this to say:\"\n\nAnother voice, gruff and irritated, came through the radio’s speakers. \"Fuck off. I did what was right by those I swore to protect.\"\n\nDJ Pon3’s voice returned. \"Just warms the heart to know that there are ponies steadfastly defending prejudice and bigotry, doesn’t it?

TEN.14.title:0 "A Change in Management"
TEN.14.desc:0 "Residents awoke this morning to discover that Tenpony Tower had undergone a change in management overnight. A number of security forces loyal to the former disgraced Chief Grim Star have taken full control of the Tower, stationing loyal guards at each security post and declaring martial law. All residents are expected to have a valid reason to move through any security checkpoints, and access to the Administrative District has been fully restricted.\n\nDue to the ongoing lockdown of the Administrative District, the Tenpony Armory has been repurposed to serve as a temporary administrative office for the Tower. All members of the previous Tenpony Administration are currently under house arrest, with their fates uncertain. Various security staff and trusted residents have been appointed to temporarily manage the Tower. \n\nAs for Grim Star himself, he was released from his cell in the early hours of the morning. Though he had very little to do with directing the apparent coup itself, he has now assumed full command of his forces and of the Tower. In an official statement, he had this to say:\n\n\"I wish to reassure every resident of Tenpony Tower that I, and all of Tenpony Security, have only their best interests at heart. Know we did not take this action lightly, but rather, we took it only to protect and further the interests of every one of you. We know that this change may be sudden, and many ponies have already expressed a great deal of concern regarding it. However, we are fully dedicated to ensuring that this transition is as smooth as possible, and we look forward to resuming normal life soon enough. Until then, just remember that we are your friends, not your enemies.\""
TEN.14.a:0 "Times Are Changing"

TEN.15.title:0 "You Gotta Shoot 'Em in the Head"
TEN.15.desc:0 "The ghouls thought themselves to be well defended, behind their scrap walls and salvaged barricades. And perhaps they would of stood a chance if they were just facing a disorganized gang of raiders, or a small band of slavers. However, much to their misfortune, they weren't facing either of those. Rather, they were facing the full might and force of Tenpony Security!\n\nOn Grim Star's orders, a small army of our finest guards set about wiping out the ghoul threat. Though their makeshift walls may of made our approach difficult, they proved to be the only real obstacle we faced. All it took was blowing them down with explosives, and then charging in. From there, it was like shooting mutated fish in an irradiated barrel. Most of the zombies didn't even have guns!\n\nDespite our success, it isn't all good news. That damned Sheriff Rotting Tail managed to take out several of our brave guards as they were attempting to breach the walls. A funeral service will be held for them, and plans are already being drafted for a monument to their sacrifice. At least Rotting Tail and his ilk will never bother us again."
TEN.15.a:0 "Another threat erradicated."

TEN.16.title:0 "Revolt!"
TEN.16.desc:0 "This is a message from the rightful Administration of Tenpony Tower, now broadcasting from the reclaimed Tenpony Information Center. We ask that those of you who are sensible and wish to see a return to sanity aid us in our cause, to restore peace and order to the Tower that we built up.\n\nOn this day, one year ago, the traitorous and maniacal Grim Star forcibly seized control of the Tower that this Administration worked so hard to make great. This terrible move is one that we could of forgiven, if it had been but a misguided act of protectiveness towards our valued residents. However, this was not the case. The traitor's actions then, and since then, have been those of a mad man, who cares only about his own power and little more. What he has down has ruined our great tower, destroyed the lives of our residents, and destroyed our reputation across the wasteland.\n\nThis must end.\n\nAs we speak, those loyal to the cause of serving our residents are moving to secure the Mall. Though the battle may be fierce, and though our losses may be many, we know that it is preferable to Grim Star's ongoing madness. A madness that goes against all this Tower has ever stood for! Even now, he barricades himself in his armory like a coward! We shall drag him out by his flank if we must, and force him to face trial for the crimes he has committed during his illegitimate rule!\n\nWe also are extending an offer to those of you among Grim Star's ranks who are still rational enough to recognize his madness. Any who throw down their arms and surrender will not be held accountable for anything they were forced to do under Grim Star's rule. Rather, they shall be welcomed back as full residents of our beloved Tower, just as soon as we resecure our rule.\n\nTo those resident's still trapped within Grim Star's clutches, we tell you this, hang in there. Help is on the way.\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely, the Tenpony Tower Administration."

TEN.23.desc:0 "It is well known, that Tenpony Tower is much larger than it looks from the outside. A recent discovery just proved this once more.\n\nA few days ago, a maintenance group was clearing out one of the many hallways on the Western side of the building. Apparently, a corridor has been buried by countless boxes and other remnants of the former Equestria since the end of the war. After the debris had been removed, our team faced a smaller corridor with four rooms on both sides.\n\nThere is a terminal at the entrance, that used to list all the items inside of them. Most of the data became corrupted by now, however, we managed to restore some of it.\n\nWhile it's not impossible to hack the interlock of the doors, it's time-consuming and our technicians are already needed on other locations, so we can only open one door at once."
TEN.23.a:0 "Life is full of surprises."

TEN.24.title:0 "Heavy Lifters"
TEN.24.desc:0 "\”Alright, it should work now.\", said the technician and rebooted the terminal. It was old and rusty, so it took some time. But eventually, it loaded all the data.\n\nHe opened the document and sighed in relief. Some words were still not restored, but at least the file is now readable:\n\"Room 1, corridor 2a:\n50 heavy lifters, used in ×»^'Ë9á¾Ü³>& for the transportation of heavy lab equipment ›˜s prototypes. We have better models by now, so only use them as reserves.\n- Prof. Dark dßRÕÄ\"\n\nThe recovery team opened the door, hoping for the best, and they were lucky: Only eight lifters didn't survive over the years. The rest, however, was still intact and functioned properly. Sure, there are more advanced models by now, but if we have no other option, they can do the job too."
TEN.24.a:0 "Now if that’s not some good news!"

TEN.25.title:0 "Armor Storage"
TEN.25.desc:0  "\"Almost... done\", said the technician, struggling to recover the data. \"That should be it. Now we're gonna rebooted this thing and see if it works.\"\n\nWhile the terminal was booting up, the technician was visibly nervous. He knew that if it didn't work, he could start all over. Luckily, his fears have proven untrue and the file was readable again:\n\"Room 3, corridor 2a:\nI know I'm not authorized to do this, but I'm just gonna store these here. Or does anypony ´'í›ÕSSý§û)? No, so where's the problem? Anyways, a company from èð\šñ will come and pick them up next Monday. Three stripped PA, 20 T45d PA, and six T51b PA. All of them are outdated and too damaged or obsolete for the front, so we're gonna sell them. It's not my fault that ¯¶{¸» didn't give me clear orders.\n-Cpt. Swift Wish\"\n\nThe recovery team proceeded to open the door, hoping the power armors were in the same shape as the heavy lifters. One minute later, the door was open and the team relieved. The power armors were still functioning. A bit rusty and old, yes, but nothing that our mechanics can't handle."
TEN.25.a:0 "Say again that something like luck doesn’t exist."

TEN.26.title:0 "Ammunition Storage"
TEN.26.desc:0  "\"Ok, I think I've got the hang on it.\", the technician rebooted the terminal. After four times, he sort of knew what he had to do. The uncertainty, if the data was properly restored or not, was gone - you could almost say that it became a routine. Anyways, everything worked out as expected and most of the data could be saved.\n\n\"Room 5, corridor 2a:\nA convoy arrived today with tons of small arms. That is all well and good, but Major Lucky Star is just an idiot. Not only were we forced to use the stairs instead of the elevator when we brought the boxes up here, but he also had to choose the shabbiest room to store them in. It'll be a wonder if the water pipe survives another week, but then it's not my fault if EÏHÑÓJŸ®Þ8T; are useless.\n- Cpt. ûv\P? Wish\"\n\nThe recovery team faced a dilemma. They don't know if the water pipe flooded the room and if the storage survived it, so hacking the door lock could be a waste of time and resources. However, if they're not opening it, restoring the data would've been an even bigger waste. They considered their options for a bit and concluded, that opening it is the best option.\n\nThe technician did his job and a few moments later, the door stood wide open. The ponies used their flashlights and what they saw shocked them to the bones. The room was full of unused grenades, which could've gone off at any time during the past 200 years. Luckily, the water pipe was broken as the Captain predicted and flooded the room, making most of them useless. Only 50 - 70 were still intact."
TEN.26.a:0 "Could have been worse."

TEN.27.title:0 "Magical Weapon Prototype"
TEN.27.desc:0 "\"This one's definitely easier than the last one.\" The technician confidently restarted the terminal. He was still unsure if everything worked as intended, but at least he wasn't so nervous like the last time. His hopes became true and they had access to the file.\n\n\"Room 4, corridor 2a:\nAlright, I want that nopony, absolutely NOPONY, enters this room without my clear permission. If I catch anypony in there, ÜžxÏÌ)]4©ÔàAÈé'ëã_¾T¶MœE©<À,ÞP}È×Iò5~›    _ÝÑH½,d. This damned rifle has caused enough damage, I don't need any more deaths around here. The MAS will come next Tuesday and bring it to some Maripony base. I don't care what they're gonna do with it there, as long as I don't have to deal with it anymore.\n- Col. Lightning $¢°k\"\n\nThe ponies of the recovery team were excited. What was so special about that rifle, that even the MAS had to bring it to a different site? The technician didn't need to be told twice and in a possibly record-breaking speed, he opened the door.\n\nThe ponies stepped inside and were presented with a rather macabre scene. A rifle was placed on a table and around it were 5 or 6 half-melted skeletons. The rifle itself pointed towards a hole in the wall, which was about one meter in diameter, and contained a crystal that was bright enough to serve as a source of light. \n\nThe team didn't know how to proceed. One wrong move and they ended like the skeletons. But if they just leave it in the room, they risk that the rifle goes off eventually and no one knows what would happen then. They figured that it'd be the best to call their scientists and as it turned out, the rifle was too damaged to be used. But with proper analysis, we could replicate some parts for our own magical weapons, with better security measures of course, and have a good magical weapon."

TEN.28.desc:0 "\"Ok, that should be it. This was more difficult than expected. Let's see if it works…\", the technician rebooted the terminal and stepped back. For the last hour, he tried to restore the data, and if this didn't work, he wouldn't know what else he could do. Fortunately, he found the issue and saved the file.\n\n\"Room 2, corridor 2a:\nThe MAS is driving me crazy. Every other day, they're asking me 'Are you done yet?', 'When will you finish it?', Ëþà!˜ÎO³ They just don't understand the problem. If something is made by ponies, it can be beaten by ponies. And the encryption of terminals is no different pZ that. Anyways, I think we're close to a breakthrough, so maybe I can ýoTáÒf the deadline by a month.\n- Prof. Dr. Midnight Sparkle\"\n\nThe recovery team was excited. If the Prof. achieved his breakthrough before the mega spells dropped, it could be a large gain for our intelligence network. The technician opened the door and the ponies went inside. However, what they found was rather disappointing and only a few blueprints and idea concepts were inside. We'll give it to our IT team, perhaps they can use them somehow."
TEN.28.a:0 "Let’s hope we have more luck with the other doors."

TEN.29.title:0 "The Secure Door"
TEN.29.desc:0 "Deep within Tenpony Tower, hidden behind several fake walls and magical illusions, resided a door. On the surface, it looked to be a very simple door, one made of wood with a cheap plastic handle. However, as the Twilight Society knew all too well, looks can be deceiving. \n \n What initially appeared to be a rather mundane door was in fact one of the most secure entryways within the entire tower. Physically, the wood was merely a facade for hard metal that made up the actual door. The handle did nothing, with the real unlocking mechanism being entirely arcane in nature. More wards were placed on it than the tower itself, protecting both the door and the room it guarded. The best minds of the Twilight Society spent weeks analyzing each and every spell placed upon this entryway, trying to discern any possible method of unlocking it. A breakthrough was had, and it was determined that it would accept only a vocal phrase from a select individual. And so, one of the younger members of the Society was tasked with playing holotape recordings of various high ranking M.A.S officials, including the Ministry Mare herself. After a week straight, the correct phrase was found."

TEN.30.title:0 "An Unusual Find"
TEN.30.desc:0 "A great rumble shook Tenpony Tower, as a mighty door at its very heart opened. Numerous security wards were dispelled, automated turrets were put offline, and a young inductee would be the first to witness what appeared to be an impossibly huge library. More senior members of the Twilight Society were quick to respond, and a formal expedition into this well-guarded room was hastily organized. \n \n Within a hour, every senior member of the Society was brought together. As one, they made their way into this great library that had been kept secure for so long. Every book was contained within plain binding, with no titles or other markings denoting their contents. The first theory to be thrown out was that these were copies of banned literature. Another theory was that these all contained knowledge better left forgotten, dark magic and horrible hexes that were too evil for the public to have access to. They all tensed as a less cautious member of their group pulled a tome off of one of the many shelves along the wall, opened its cover, and began to read. \n \n 'A Rainbow Romance, by Twilight Sparkle.' \n \n Upon further examination, every single one of the thousands of books contained within the room seemed to be along similar lines. A simple vote was held, and it was decided to reseal the room and forget it had ever existed."

Thanks to their support, we were not only able to finally get rid of these raiders that have been doing unspeakable things to us for as long as we can remember, but we also have some sort of an industry now. Now, it's apparently time for us to do something in return for them, and they ask for nothing more than our membership in their newly founded alliance.\nOn one hoof, it's the least we can do for them and it would be only fair if we helped them after they helped us.\nBut on the other one, it would still mean that we will lose all of our sovereignty. Some of our citizens are already worried about Tenpony's increasing influence, and by accepting this invitation, we would lose the little independence we have left.\nThe decision is anything but easy, but we have gone through so many struggles by now, we'd survive this one as well."
