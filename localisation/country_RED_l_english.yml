Now cohesive armies fight all across the wasteland, and as the stagnation of the Sunnyshore War continues, it becomes more and more evident that our army is not what it once was. Raiders are let loose to sow chaos, usually at a detriment to our own forces, while slaves cower away from battle, and our once galvinized Talon forces have become disinterested and are not preforming nearly as well as they should. If our army is to advance into the future, we must choose one portion of it to prioritize..."

Unfortunately, an unforeseen side effect of our conquest is that most of the raider gangs of the area are now operating in our territory and are terrorizing the countryside."

redeye.9.desc:0 "The guards stationed above the Gate of Fillydelphia were met with a surprise upon beginning their shift this morning. A large group of fully-armored Steel Rangers were demanding an audience with Master Red Eye himself. After well over an hour of hurried communications between various levels of command, their request finally went to Red Eye himself. He readily accepted, on the condition that only their leader meet with him, and that they be fully disarmed before they meet.\n\nSo it was that former Star Paladin Nova Rage, with her power armor and weaponry removed, went to meet Red Eye. Their meeting lasted several hours, but by the end of it, the integration of the Steel Ranger Outcasts into Red Eye’s Armies was finalized."
redeye.9.a:0 "We always welcome any volunteers for the cause."

redeye.10.title:0 "The Failure of Blood Mane"
redeye.10.desc:0 "Red Eye sat there, his head held firmly within his forehooves. Despite Red Eye’s generous donations of soldiers and guns, Blood Mane continues to stall, even after Red Eye’s firm demands to attack. If this is the kind of pony Blood Mane was, then perhaps there is no place for her in Red Eye’s empire. Weakness like this should not be tolerated.\n\nRed Eye made up his mind. New Mareway would still fall. If not at the hooves of Blood Mane, then by the hooves of Red Eye himself. Lifting his head up, Red Eye prepared to send out the necessary orders. New Mareway would be his."
redeye.10.a:0 "Never trust another pony to do your work..."

redeye.11.title:0 "Foaltopia Declines!"
redeye.11.desc:0 "Our demands to annex the small kiddie-paradise that is Foaltopia has been met with a firm “no”. Clearly the stubbornness that is the child has gotten the better of them and even in the face of Slavery they refuse to make things easy. Red Eye is not entirely comfortable with the idea of invading this innocent hideout of mostly orphaned children, but he’s left with no choice."
redeye.11.a:0 "It didn't have to be like this."

redeye.12.title:0 "Foaltopia Accepts!"
redeye.12.desc:0 "The Kiddie-paradise that is Foaltopia has finally come to some sense for once and have agreed to our annexation. They knew that they were too young to take on the legions of slavers and raiders that could’ve decimated them should they decline, and they knew that they could barely hold their own without adults protecting them. In exchange for their annexation they would be spared death but numbers of Foaltopia’s population would be raised into slavery as well as become future slavers. Red Eye knew this wasn’t easy for the children of Foaltopia, but there were worse fates."
redeye.12.a:0 "Welcome Home!"

redeye.13.title:0 "A Curious Offer"
redeye.13.desc:0 "Railright was awoken by rapid knocking at his door in the early hours of the morning. Opening it would reveal a panicking town guard, who nearly yelled at him that someone was here to see him.\n\nThis would start what would be a very busy day for Railright. This ‘someone’ turned out to be a griffon, sent by Red Eye himself to extend an offer to the town of New Appleloosa. The offer was simple: he wanted them to become part of his empire. In exchange, they would be given protection and become economically integrated with the rest of his domain.\n\nFor much of the day, all of the notable ponies in town and then some voiced their thoughts and opinions. The town was heavily divided, with many not trusting a thing Red Eye had promised, while others looked only at the potential benefits of such a relationship. Back and forth arguing persisted for hours, until Railright himself spoke up..."
redeye.13.a:0 "He saved us before..."
redeye.13.b:0 "We'll never bend!"

redeye.14.title:0 "New Appleloosa Folds"
redeye.14.desc:0 "News has come in from New Appleloosa. Their town has reached a majority consensus to join our new Equestria. Preparations are already being made to send soldiers and caravans their way."

redeye.15.desc:0 "Word has come in from Old Appleloosa. They have agreed to take our working relationship to the next level by joining us fully."
redeye.15.a:0 "It's been a long time coming."

redeye.16.title:0 "New Appleloosa Stands Firm"
redeye.16.desc:0 "News has come in from New Appleloosa. Their town has reached a majority consensus to refuse our generous offer. Perhaps they didn’t realize that this offer only really had one choice."
redeye.16.a:0 "Oh well, go get em!"

redeye.17.title:0 "Old Appleloosa Stands Alone"
redeye.17.desc:0 "Word has come in from Old Appleloosa. To our surprise, they have actually refused our offer of integration. Perhaps it was simply out of stubborness, but they’ll soon get a reminder as to just who they are dealing with."
redeye.17.a:0 "That was unexpected."

redeye.18.title:0 "An Ultimatum"
redeye.18.desc:0 "We’ve had a very close working relationship with Red Eye for a while now. Surplus slaves are often sold to him, and we’ve bought supplies off of him in the past. So Red Eye’s offer of full integration came to no surprise to any of us.\n\nHowever, despite not being a surprising offer, it is no less a controversial one. Many of the slavers around here aren’t a big fan of Red Eye, with opinions ranging from distaste to outright hatred for the stallion. But it’s undeniable that he has been a good trading partner thus far. It’s also undeniable that his armies could march right on in and take us over with little difficulty. With these things in mind, a decision is made..."
redeye.18.a:0 "Why the hell not?"
redeye.18.b:0 "Hell no!"

redeye.23.title:0 "The Unavoidable Crime"
redeye.23.desc:0 "Every day, ponies worked and died under Red Eye’s rule. The factories ate up ponies near as fast as they did raw material, the smog took more and more lives every day, and the slaves themselves were directly involved in more than a few of the daily casualties.\n\nLooking out across his domain, these thoughts went through Red Eye’s mind. Down below, he could see slaves reporting for what could very well be their last work detail, before their bodies would finally give out and life would leave them. In the distance, he could see the flames and smoke of the vast foundries that supplied his army with steel. Over the sounds of industry, the occasional gunshot could be heard. A punishment for unruliness, or to end the suffering of an injured slave? The end result was still the same, either way: another pony dead. Another body for the pile. Another casualty of Fillydelphia.\n\nSo many deaths, so much suffering, and all of it because of him. Because of what he had done, because of what he had created. This level of suffering was unthinkable before the war!\n\nAnd yet, the wasteland claimed just as much responsibility as he did. Out there, ponies suffered and died just the same as they would within the walls of Fillydelphia. Only the wasteland had been inflicting pain and suffering for over 200 years now, with no end in sight. No end, that is, until he came along. With each life given in Fillydelphia, another is saved down the line. With each factory made operational, another step is made towards rebuilding and recreating that harmonic society from before the war. Red Eye knew that he could not lose sight of that goal, that dream. Equestria would be rebuilt, and ponykind would be saved."
redeye.23.a:0 "Salvation, no matter the cost."

redeye.24.title:0 "War, It Never Changes"
redeye.24.desc:0 ""
redeye.24.a:0 "For a bright future."

redeye.25.title:0 "Into The Angry Forest"
redeye.25.desc:0 "The Everfree Forest; for countless years since the abandonment of the Castle of the Two Sisters the Forest went untouched by ponykind never to be cleared or ventured into, mostly because of the innumerable amount of beasts that dwell within it and the unpredictable magic and weather that had reigned over it for so long, even the Balefire bombs 200 years ago left the Forest mostly intact from its prewar days. Now, as Red Eye looks upon the thousands of half-dead trees that is the Everfree, he knows that he needs more room to house more ponies in his cathedral, and that finally doing away with the bane that is the Everfree is the only solution. Eventually he gathered ponies that would set Fire Spells that would torch the trees of the Everfree and the beasts that roam within it would perish. Within moments the entire Forest was aflame, and it was quite a spectacle that many across the wasteland could see."
redeye.25.a:0 "Leave no beasts alive."

redeye.26.title:0 "A New Dawn in the Everfree"
redeye.26.desc:0 "What was once the Everfree Forest was now a smoldering field of ash filled with bones from the beasts that failed to flee the fires. Now this area was much easier to clear out, and Red Eye has made orders that this newly cleared area to be swept and settled. More and more of the former Everfree was converted to shantytowns for the populace both slaver and slave, and more Industrial workshops were being propped up, and there’s still a lot more room to expand. It was all good for Red Eye, all at the expense of some troublesome Forest."

The smog was thinner than usual, the gunshots that usually rang out at all times of day had fallen silent, and the factories of Fillydelphia lie near abandoned. To the slaves, this was a miracle. An unscheduled day of rest, something that was considered near unthinkable in the harsh world of Fillydelphia. To the slavers, this was also a day of merriment. No action, no excitement, and no work to be done! It was a welcome respite from the usual busy life of an employee in Red Eye's empire.\n\nThough not all were quite so happy. Indeed, one griffon in particular was quite the opposite.\n\nVery few things went through Stern's mind that were not related to the most painful and brutal way to kill Shackles. He had been the cause of many a problem for her before, but this was crossing a line! She would not stand for this. Across from her sat the stallion himself, just as grimey and vile as always. And around them stood a number of Fillydelphia's most elite slavers, all powerful and feared mares and stallions from across Fillydelphia. Shackle's had presented her his conditions. They were simple: She was to turn over much of Fillydelphia's stockpiled equipment to slaver guards, to help secure the protection of Fillydelphia. In exchange Shackle's would personally ensure every slave in Fillydelphia would be hard at work by tomorrow. Refuse, and their vacation would be extended as long as he deemed necessary. And of course, he wished to broadcast these terms and her acceptance of them across all of Fillydelphia, for the slavers and Talons alike to witness.\n\nShe knew there was little she could do. Though her griffons were certainly capable, they lacked the sheer numbers necessary to force the slaves and slavers back to work. Shackle's disgusting maw widened into a smile as Stern considered his terms. He knew that there was only one way this could go, and Stern knew it too. Soon, all of Fillydelphia would know that he was their Master."

redeye.73.desc:0 "Fillydelphia was louder than usual. Rather than the usual noises of heavy machinary and slaves being punished, there was instead the sounds of fighting, of shouting, and of brawling. The slaves, those downtrodden masses who had been forced to labor away against their will for a cause that was not their own, had finally had enough! A rebellion was underway, with The Pit being at the center of it. Slaves from all over Fillydelphia were now rioting, beating down slavers left and right. What was initially believed to be a minor riot had rapidly spiralled out of control, as slaver forces were beaten back again and again. Several checkpoints had already fallen, and the slaves had obtained a number of guns via looting them from the corpses of slavers.\n\nThe situation would only continue to grow more and more out of control if immediate action wasn't taken. However, much to the ire of one particular stallion observing the situation from a temporary field command center, those responsible for taking that action were refusing to do so. The courier that had the unfortunate duty of delivering Stern's message to Shackle's had not lived long enough to carry his reply. A slaver stood rooted in place, ready to take up the couriers duty, and silently praying he did not meet a similar fate.\n\nShackles, despite outward appearances, was hardly stupid. He recognized when he was backed in a corner, and he knew that there was only one real option available to him: to accept Stern's demands, effectively placing large portions of Fillydelphia's industry and, more importantly it's slavers, under her direct command and oversight. To do otherwise was to risk this pathetic slave rebellion spiralling ever more out of control, until such a point where it directly threatened even him. He barked his response to the newly conscripted courier, before nearly throwing him out of the command room.\n\nThat griffon bitch would get his response, as much as he hated to give it."

Despite having more than enough soldiers and guns, generously provided by himself, the Bloody Army had still somehow managed to fail. How exactly they had been beaten back by the likes of New Mareway was a total mystery.\n\nYet, New Mareway would still fall. If not at the hooves of Blood Mane, then by the hooves of Red Eye himself. Lifting his head up, Red Eye prepared to send out the necessary orders. New Mareway would be his."

 RED_gearbox_desc:0 "Optimistic almost to a fault, §YGearbox§! is a bright mare with a penchant for fixing and building machinery who could have lived her entire life as a happy mechanic in the Hinterlands. Of course, the wasteland is rarely that kind, and Gearbox was swept up in Red Eye’s brutal conquest of the Hinterlands. Gearbox’s father was a one of the foremost collaborators during the campaign, betraying his friends and fellow Flatlanders in exchange for a place in Red Eye’s new order, alongside the guarantee that his family would remain free. As such, Gearbox found herself thrust into the highest echelons of Boomtown, a role that she detested greatly. To distract herself, she began to listen to the radio, and she was instantly captivated by Red Eye’s charismatic promises to build a better future, one where all ponies worked together in a great unity, and accepted the necessary evils that came alongside it. Taken by the lofty ideals, Gearbox set out to aid the cause in anyway she could, which eventually landed her a place in Red Eye’s Army, leading ponies to a better future.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Genri"
