### FOCUS TREE ###
##################

### Opening Focuses ###
  RED_birthofamonster:0 "Birth of a Monster"
  RED_birthofamonster_desc:0 "Red Eye was not always the monster of the Wasteland. Once, he was but a simple scout for Stable 101, burried deep in the heart of the Everfree... A scout who saw the horrors of the wastes, and who saw his Stable do nothing to help those who were suffering. He knew that something had to change, regardless of whether or not his Stable agreed."

  RED_lifeofamonster:0 "Building a New World"
  RED_lifeofamonster_desc:0 "Canterlot was not built in a day, and neither will Red Eye's Equestria. The unruly masses of Red Eye's empire do not yet realize that their sacrifice will better the world of tomorrow. They continue to grow angry and resentful, ignorant to the greater good. At times, they even try to rise up against him. "

  RED_futureofamonster:0 "Red Eye's Army"
  RED_futureofamonster_desc:0 "While it is one of the most formidable forces the Wasteland has ever seen, Red Eye's army is an interesting sort; Made up of unruly and trigger-happy raiders, slaves resigned to their deaths, the elite Talon Mercs, and a smattering of traditional army regulars, our army faces significant coordination issue."

### Sunnyshore War Tree ###
  RED_sunnyshore:0 "Roads to Sunnyshore"
  RED_sunnyshore_desc:0 "The Sunnyshore Campaign has been a disaster thus far, with the once-divided settlements of the region managing to unexpectedly band together to resist our armies. One of the issues we've had throughout this conflict is providing our forces with supplies and reinforcements. To resolve this issue, we will clear away rubble and build new roads between Fillydelphia and the front lines."

  RED_march_to_sea:0 "March to the Sea"
  RED_march_to_sea_desc:0 "This war has been going on long enough. Though the Sunnyshore Coalition continues to resist us now, this will soon come to an end. It's time we put an end to it, as quickly as we possibly can."

  RED_militia_mobi:0 "Mobilize Militias"
  RED_militia_mobi_desc:0 "When the Sunnyshore Coalition was formed, not every settlement was willing to be a part of it. The region has always been highly unstable, and some settlements saw accepting our rule as preferable to working with their rivals. Their intersettlement hatred goes so deep that many ponies would even be willing to help our armies invade their rivals."

  RED_destroy_resistance:0 "Destroy the Gangs"
  RED_destroy_resistance_desc:0 "Red Eye has always had a clear policy when it comes to raiders: We do not tolerate their ilk within our territory. They may operate all they wish, so long as they stay outside of our borders. Unfortunately, it seems that the raiders of the Sunnyshore region disagree with this policy. They continue to operate within our newly conquered territory, as if we were the disunited settlements that they have terrorized for so long. We'll have to deal with them before we can consolidate our control over the region."

### Industry Tree ###
  RED_fire_industry:0 "The Fire of Industry"
  RED_fire_industry_desc:0 "Shortly before the Great War, Equestria went through a second industrial revolution. From this, the nation was able to completely remake itself. If we wish to rebuild this great nation, we shall have to reignite those fires of industry once more."

  # Fillydelpia Path
  RED_the_city:0 "The City"
  RED_the_city_desc:0 "The flames of the industrial revolution once blazed across the world, but there was nowhere where they burned brighter than within the city of Fillydelphia. This great city was Equestria's largest industrial hub even before the Great War, but it only further expanded to meet the needs of wartime Equestria. This great city shall once more become the industrial envy of the world."

  RED_remove_parasprites:0 "Exterminate Parasprites"
  RED_remove_parasprites_desc:0 "There are many buildings within the city that we can't scavenge due to the ongoing parasprite infestation. This infestation has existed since before even the Great War, but it has only grown exponentially worse over the last two centuries. To make matters even worse, these little buggers have picked up a taste for pony flesh over the years. We'll have to deal with them if we're to have free reign of our own city."

  RED_fortify_bridge:0 "Fortify the Bridge"
  RED_fortify_bridge_desc:0 "A simple bridge separates us from the Steel Rangers that occupy the south side of Fillydelphia. Sooner or later, we'll likely end up in a conflict with those power armored relics. It would be best if we prepared ahead of time for that possibility."

  RED_filly_automotive:0 "Reopen Fillydelphia Motors"
  RED_filly_automotive_desc:0 "Self-propelled carriages were relatively rare before the War, being a luxury that was restricted to just the upper crust of Equestria. This changed radically once Equestria's industry was kicked into high gear. Countless carriages were produced, at first just for the military, but later for the consumer sphere as well. One of the most successful commercial manufacturers within Equestria was Fillydelphia Motors, which was responsible for the widely successful Model C carriage, which was one of the most common civilian carriages to be found across Equestria. With a bit of touch up, their factories could be put to work once more."

  RED_radiation_engine:0 "The Radation Engine"
  RED_radiation_engine_desc:0 "One unfortunate byproduct of the balefire used to destroy the world was arcane radiation, which still blankets the world to this very day. This radiation contaminates the ground, water, and air around us, killing anypony who suffers from too much exposure. For centuries now, this has been nothing but a danger to the ponies of Equestria. Fortunately, we believe that we have finally found a purpose for this environmental hazard. We have designed a massive engine which is capable of taking arcane radiation and turning it into usable energy."

  RED_loot_stabletec:0 "Loot Stable-Tec HQ"
  RED_loot_stabletec_desc:0 "Now that Stable-Tec HQ is under our control, we can salvage the building and everything in it. An automated tour guide system is very fascinating and all, but its components could be put to much better use elsewhere. We do have to wonder, though: Why did the Steel Rangers leave this system intact?"

  RED_restore_power:0 "Restore The Power Grid"
  RED_restore_power_desc:0 "Fillydelphia's power grid has seen better days. The end of the world, two centuries without maintenance, and an out of control parasprite infestation have all contributed to most of the city's power lines being destroyed. It would help our operations run much more efficiently if we made the effort to fix the severed lines and reconnect the power grid."

  # Everfree Path
  RED_the_forest:0 "The Forest"
  RED_the_forest_desc:0 "Red Eye has never forgotten his home, which lies deep within the depths of the Everfree Forest. The forest itself is far from the safest place in Equestria, being full of all sorts of dangerous mutated fauna and flora. While this has made the forest very deadly to anypony who dares venture into it, it has also kept Stable 101 safe from any attempted outside incursion. Thanks to this, the Stable is still in operational condition to this very day."

  RED_cathedral:0 "The Cathedral"
  RED_cathedral_desc:0 "When Stable 101 refused to help bring about the future, they gave up any right they might of had to being a part of that future. In their place, the mighty Cathedral was built. From within the Cathedral's walls, countless ponies that are fanatically loyal to Red Eye's vision work towards making his dreams into a reality."

  RED_stable_oneoone:0 "Stable 101"
  RED_stable_oneoone_desc:0 "When the time came, Stable 101 proved itself to be worthy of a place in Equestria's future. The ponies that Red Eye had grown up alongside now work towards his vision, aiding him by finding new ways to apply the innovations that the Stable had made over the last two centuries."

  RED_disciples:0 "Disciples of the Cathedral"
  RED_disciples_desc:0 "The Disciples are Red Eye's most devoted and fanatical followers. They all know their place within his great plan, and they are all more than willing to do their part towards helping restore Equestria. They even go so far as to preach his words to the masses, desperately trying to convince them that the world will be a utopia once more if everypony just does their part."

  RED_full_labs:0 "Fully Staffed Labs"
  RED_full_labs_desc:0 "By Red Eye's time, Stable 101 had already begun to run into a population problem. Much of the Stable was understaffed, with numerous positions going unfilled. With the backing of Fillydelphia, this problem can be resolved by taking in the most qualified experts across post-apocalyptic Equestria and giving them purpose within the walls of the Stable."

  RED_cyberdogs:0 "Doc Slaughter's Dogs"
  RED_cyberdogs_desc:0 "The eccentric and ethically questionable Doc Slaughter has always had a strong fascination with two things: cybernetics and dogs. With the resources at our disposal, we are able to fund his efforts to combine those two interests into one in a way that could be beneficial to our own efforts across the Equestrian Wasteland."

  RED_cathedral_arms:0 "Tower Workshops"
  RED_cathedral_arms_desc:0 "Right now, the towers of the Castle of the Two Sisters are currently going unused. This space could be better utilized through creating workshops that can help supply guns to our soldiers. While we're at it, we'll also go ahead and add an anti-air cannon to one of them. If nothing else, we can use it to kill any ursa majors that get too close."

  RED_everfree_road:0 "The Everfree Road"
  RED_everfree_road_desc:0 "Traveling through the Everfree Forest is far from a pleasant experience. The terrain itself is hard to navigate, made even worse by the forest's magical qualities and the many dangers lurking within. This state of affairs can't continue. We shall begin a large effort to clear away as much of the forest as possible through a liberal application of flamer fuel."

  # Hinterlands Path
  RED_the_hinterlands:0 "The Hinterlands"
  RED_the_hinterlands_desc:0 "The underdeveloped land between the Everfree Forest and Fillydelphia is known as the Hinterlands. Within these lands, settlements are scarce and resources are even scarcer. Developing it will be difficult, but it will be necessary if we wish to connect the two halves of our empire."

  RED_boomtown_pits:0 "Boomtown Slave Pits"
  RED_boomtown_pits_desc:0 "Boomtown is hardly what we would consider a prospering settlement. It was actually built as a megaspell testing site during the Great War, but the test planned to be conducted there never happened before the end of the world. A bit over a century later, a group of scavengers settled down in the testing site, and Boomtown was properly founded. Unfortunately, its origins led to it lacking any sort of industrial foundation. Though the residents managed to create a few small workshops before we showed up, they are nowhere near large enough to suit our needs. To solve this problem, we shall put the town's entire population to work building and then working in new factories."

  RED_settle_backcountry:0 "Settle the Backcountry"
  RED_settle_backcountry_desc:0 "Much of the Hinterlands is simply devoid of any settlements. This creates a problem when it comes to moving supplies, ponies, or resources across that land. To help with this problem, we shall pay ponies to go into those areas and create proper settlements."

  RED_iron_cliffs:0 "Mine the Iron Cliffs"
  RED_iron_cliffs_desc:0 "The Iron Cliffs are known as such because they were once home to Equestria's most productive iron mines. Unfortunately, these mines were closed well before even the end of the War. However, we believe that we have identified numerous ore deposits that are untapped. With a bit of effort, we could bring the mines back into fully operational condition."

  RED_fort_carmine:0 "Reinforce Fort Carmine"
  RED_fort_carmine_desc:0 "Overlooking Boomtown is the military base known as Fort Carmine. The fort has seen better days, but it wouldn't be too difficult to rennovate it to serve as both an industrial hub and a military outpost within the region."

  RED_red_forest:0 "Forest Clearing"
  RED_red_forest_desc:0 "West of Fillydelphia lies the vast Red Forest. Though it is nowhere near as hostile as the Everfree Forest, it is still a pain to move through. Fortunately, it wouldn't be difficult to clear away large sections of the forest, especially with the use of slave labor. We could even use the lumber to build new workshops."

  RED_flatlander_knowledge:0 "Flatlander Knowledge"
  RED_flatlander_knowledge_desc:0 "The ponies of the Flatlands are well educated in matters of both farming and mining. Perhaps we could hire a few of them to share their expertise with us."  

### Reuniting Equestria Tree ###
  RED_reuniting_equestria:0 "Reuniting Equestria"
  RED_reuniting_equestria_desc:0 ""

  # Eastward Expansion
  RED_marching_east:0 "Looking East"
  RED_marching_east_desc:0 ""

  RED_break_the_mob:0 "Break the Mob"
  RED_break_the_mob_desc:0 "The criminals to the east consider themselves better than your run of the mill raider by virtue of being a bit more polite about their crimes. It is well past time that we remind them that a crime is a crime and justice is blind."

  RED_dappleshore:0 "Conquer the Poninsula"
  RED_dappleshore_desc:0 ""

  RED_redeye_takes_manehattan:0 "Red Eye Takes Manehattan!"
  RED_redeye_takes_manehattan_desc:0 ""

  # Southern Expansion
  RED_marching_south:0 "Looking South"
  RED_marching_south_desc:0 ""

  RED_nyocastle:0 "Crack Down On the Guilds"
  RED_nyocastle_desc:0 ""

  RED_western_reaches:0 "Invade Central Equestria"
  RED_western_reaches_desc:0 ""

  RED_shattered_hoof_gamble:0 "§YThe Shattered Hoof Gamble§!"
  RED_shattered_hoof_gamble_desc:0 "Our first attempt to conquer the raiders of Shattered Hoof did not end well; However, we can learn from our mistakes, and try again without any of the subterfuge that bogged down our last attempt."

### Army Tree ###
  RED_wasteland_army:0 "The Three Part Army"
  RED_wasteland_army_desc:0 "Fillydelphia's army is divided into three main parts: the raiders that have been rallied to our side, the slaves who are forced to fight on our behalf, and the Talons who were hired to serve as our elite forces. Between these three groups, we have a highly adaptable military. Unfortunately, it has also devolved into a very disjointed military, and we have been forced to choose one of these three parts to prioritize."

  RED_raider_army:0 "§RThe Raiders§!"
  RED_raider_army_desc:0 "Many of Red Eye's earliest soldiers were raiders who he had rallied to his side. Some of them were swayed by his words, others by his promises of wealth. As his forces grew, many raider gangs were even forced into joining him."

  RED_slave_army:0 "§OThe Slaves§!"
  RED_slave_army_desc:0 "As Red Eye's empire grew, so too did its need for bodies to protect it. Every raider gang within Fillydelphia had already been recruited or enslaved, most mercenaries were hesitant to throw their lot in with what they saw back then as being an insane warlord, and the surrounding settlements wanted nothing to do with the emerging power. Left with no other option, Red Eye took to forcing slaves to fight alongside his other soldiers."

  RED_merc_army:0 "§YThe Talons§!"
  RED_merc_army_desc:0 "Once it became clear that Red Eye's operations were stable and his pockets deep, mercenaries began to line up to join his army. The good pay was more than enough to make up for the long hours and few benefits. Out of these mercenaries, one company in particular proved themselves to be highly effective and obedient: Stern's Talons, who were more than willing to die in service of Red Eye."

  RED_military_cache:0 "Raid Military Caches"
  RED_military_cache_desc:0 "Wartime Equestria had plenty of armories sitting around, stocked full of weapons and other useful equipment. It's pointless for all of those guns to sit there gathering dust. We'll crack the armories open and secure the equipment for our own use."

  RED_combat_doctrine:0 "Restart \"Equestrian Army Today\" Magazine"
  RED_combat_doctrine_desc:0 "During the War, the Ministry of Image was responbile for printing a magazine that showed off the latest military technology and idolized Equestria's soldiers. More importantly, this magazine also went into depth regarding the military's training and tactics. By publishing and distributing our own version of it, we can help ensure that our training is standardized."

  RED_fighters_workers:0 "Fighters, Not Workers"
  RED_fighters_workers_desc:0 "What use is a factory if we can not defend it? Our slaves should be out on the front lines, helping us defend our borders and protect our city. Though this will cause our industrial efforts to suffer, the defence of Fillydelphia is far more important."

  RED_anti_tank_focus:0 "Can Openers"
  RED_anti_tank_focus_desc:0 "There will likely come a time in the near future when we will be expected to fight against power armored enemies, whether it be the Steel Rangers to the south or the Enclave descending from above. When this time comes, we will need to be prepared, and we fear that our anti-machine rifles simply won't cut it. Towards this end, we will begin restoring old Equestrian heavy weaponry for dealing with these foes."

  RED_elite_mercs:0 "Talon Elites"
  RED_elite_mercs_desc:0 "The Talons are the best of the best, those fighters which make even battle hardened veterans gallop for the hills. However, even among those professional hired guns, there are some who stand out as being particularly effective when it comes to carrying out their duties. We shall seek out these elite mercenaries and convince them to accept us as their new employer."

  RED_slave_commanders:0 "Slaves Commanding Slaves"
  RED_slave_commanders_desc:0 "It's amazing what a slave will do just for extra rations or a scrap of luxury. By offering such incentives, we can convince influential slaves to serve as the commanding officers for other slaves. It is our hope that the slaves will be far more inclined to fight if one of their own orders them to."

  RED_strong_leadership:0 "The Strong Will Lead"
  RED_strong_leadership_desc:0 "The strong will always rise to the top, while the weak shall be trotted on underhoof. This is a simple truth of the Wasteland. We can apply to truth to our army as well by promoting only those ponies who have proven themselves stronger than their peers. As an added bonus, our ranks will be far more inclined to respect a pony who has proven themselves over one who has not."

  RED_talon_training:0 "Griffon Discipline"
  RED_talon_training_desc:0 "Though the Talons themselves are trained professionals, most of our soldiers are not. To resolve this issue, we will place our most experienced Talons in charge of training the rest of our army to behave just as professionally as the Talons themselves."

  RED_weapons_of_war:0 "Weapons of War"
  RED_weapons_of_war_desc:0 "Guns are crucical to our efforts. Without them, our army would be near entirely incapable of dealing with even the smaller nations surrounding us. By providing our soldiers with even better guns, we can ensure that they are ready to deal with any force that may stand against us."

  RED_motor_focus:0 "War on Wheels"
  RED_motor_focus_desc:0 "During the Great War, Equestria and Zebrica alike both utilized motor-vehicles to great effect. We believe that we could do the same now, perhaps to even greater effect."

  RED_tank_focus:0 "Raider Ingenuity"
  RED_tank_focus_desc:0 "Raiders aren't known for being the most intelligent bunch, but they can be very creative. Every once and a while, this creativity leads to them coming up with a truly amazing idea. It seems that this time has struck again, as a group of raiders within our ranks have managed to cobble together a makeshift armored vehicle mounted with an anti-tank rifle. With a few adjustments and some proper schematics, we believe we could begin to produce it in mass."

  RED_slave_loyalty:0 "Fight For Your Masters!"
  RED_slave_loyalty_desc:0 "Ask any slave in our army if they would like to go back to the factories, and your answer will almost always be no. Ask any slave in the factories if they would rather be serving on the front lines, and they will oftentimes begin begging for that opportunity. Those slaves who fight in our army enjoy far more freedom and a great deal of benefits that aren't afforded to those back in Fillydelphia. This has led to them almost developing a sort of loyalty towards us, as they are eagerly willing to fight on our behalf if it means they won't be sent back to the assembly lines."

  RED_pa_focus:0 "Talon Power Armor"
  RED_pa_focus_desc:0 "Why should our enemies be the only ones with power armor? By designing our own suit made just for our most elite soldiers to wear, we could even the playing field. Soon enough, we will be the ones charging through enemy lines and destroying all within our path."

### Opening Political Tree ###
  RED_begin_consolidate_power:0 "§RThe Great Revolt§!"
  RED_begin_consolidate_power_desc:0 "The Sunnyshore Campaign has pulled many of our slavers and Talons alike away from Fillydelphia and to the front lines. Unfortunately, this has allowed dissent to fester back in the city, which has now escalated into an attempt at open revolution against us. This situation will need to be dealt with quickly, lest it escalate even further."

  RED_city_of_slaves:0 "A City Of Slaves"
  RED_city_of_slaves_desc:0 "Our slavers are severely outnumbered by those they lord over. Should it come down to it, we doubt we could survive if the majority of the slaves joined this uprising. We'll have to find a way to keep most of them in check, either through force or appeasement."

  RED_bargain_with_unions:0 "Fate of the Unions"
  RED_bargain_with_unions_desc:0 "One of the main instigators of this revolution are the so-caled 'Unions'. What was once a loose hierarchy of slaves exploiting other slaves has since evolved into the only semblance organized resistance against us. Their numbers remain small, but they rally more slaves to their side each passing day. We'll have to deal with them, one way or another."

  RED_griffon_mail:0 "Griffon Mail"
  RED_griffon_mail_desc:0 "One of the largest issues our military has faced throughout the Sunnyshore Campaign is a lack of communication. We are not unique in experiencing this issue, as Equestria has lacked any widespread organized communications for two centuries now. Perhaps it's about time we change that. After all, if we had faster communication, perhaps this revolt would of never of gotten so out of hoof to begin with."

  RED_stamp_out_fire:0 "Stamp Out the Fires"
  RED_stamp_out_fire_desc:0 "The slaves have recklessly taken to setting buildings on fire all across the city. Don't they realize that their own residencies are at risk as well? Unfortunately, we doubt that we can put out the flames fast enough to prevent any substantial damage. We'll be forced to prioritize what we want to save."

  RED_crush_gangs:0 "Crush the Remaining Gangs"
  RED_crush_gangs_desc:0 "Many different raider gangs exist within our ranks. Unfortunately, some of them have tightly clung to their gang identities. This has greatly contributed to the disarray within our ranks, with many gangs fighting one another or refusing to follow orders from someone outside of their gang. Even during this dire time, they continue to bicker and fight as if all of Fillydelphia wasn't at risk. Something must change."

  RED_crackdown:0 "The Final Crackdown"
  RED_crackdown_desc:0 "Red Eye has approved a series of measures to quell the Great Revolt once and for all. Furthermore, these measures will be overseen by Red Eye himself. The end of the tunnel is now in sight."

### Red Eye Political Tree ###
  RED_redeye_political:0 "Red Eye"
  RED_redeye_political_desc:0 "Red Eye. The Scout of Stable 101. The Master of Fillydelphia. The Ruler of the Heartland. The Prophet of the Disciples. His name is known and feared across the entire Wasteland. He has already accomplished many things that were thought impossible: unifying the great city of Fillydelphia, bringing the raiders of the Hinterlands to heel, and forging an empire. Yet this is not enough. His ambitions go far beyond simply ruling over a single city. No, he aims to truly restore Equestria. And he is willing to do anything necessary to see that goal accomplished."

  RED_redeye_radio:0 "Fillydelphia Radio"
  RED_redeye_radio_desc:0 "Hello, this is Fillydelphia Radio, bringing you the latest. In today's forecast, smog-filled skies followed by irradiated rain in the afternoon. Now, moving on to one of my favourite songs: March of the Parasprites."

  RED_redeye_labs:0 "New Science Labs"
  RED_redeye_labs_desc:0 "Technology has always played a key role in Red Eye's plan to restore Equestria. It is only through the restoration of old world technology that we have been able to restore Fillydelphia to an industrial powerhouse. Further innovation will bring us even closer to our ultimate goal of resurrecting this great nation."

  RED_redeye_schools:0 "New Schools"
  RED_redeye_schools_desc:0 "The future of the foals of this great nation are our first and foremost concern. We must seek to provide them a proper upbringing, with a proper education, so that someday they may contribute towards restoring harmony across all the land."

  RED_bigger_radio:0 "Red Eye Radio"
  RED_bigger_radio_desc:0 "'...A monster, indeed. But one with his eyes open and cast upon our future. The future of Equestria. Two hundred years ago, we lost our great nation, but we will have it again! And what would the Fruitcups and their little homestead be in two hundred years? Nothing, meaningless, not even hoofnotes in the annals of history. But... what will have meaning two hundred years from now? This factory!'"

  RED_spritebot_eyes:0 "Spritebot Monitoring"
  RED_spritebot_eyes_desc:0 "We only have so many soldiers to keep watch over a very vast land. Fortunately, it seems that the spritebots all had spyware built into them by the Ministry of Morale, which we are more than glad to use for our own purposes."

  RED_steel_rangers:0 "The Steel Rangers"
  RED_steel_rangers_desc:0 "When balefire rained from the sky, the majority of Equestria's ponies perished in the flames. However, some groups managed to live on. Isolated herds of survivors, former military personnel, and those unfortunate enough to be ghoulified all managed to survive that fateful day. Among these survivors, one group in particular is of note: The Steel Rangers, remnants of the Ministry of Wartime Technology, who sought to preserve their Ministry's work for the good of all ponykind. Over the centuries, they have abandoned part of their Mission, and have devolved into little more than technophiliac hoarders. They once prowled through Fillydelphia's ruins, stealing any bit of tech they could get their hooves on, and terrorizing the poor ponies simply trying to eek out a living. Thanks to our efforts, they were pushed out of most of the city. However, they now occupy southern Fillydelphia, where they operate out of the Stable-Tec Headquarters. They will have to be dealt with if we are to rebuild all of this great city."

  RED_future_of_rangers_desc:0 ""

  RED_rebuild:0 "Rebuilding Equestria"
  RED_rebuild_desc:0 "Equestria wasn't built in a day, nor will it be rebuilt in one. We must take small steps towards achieving this noble goal, putting one hoof ahead of the other until we one day reach a world where our ponies can once more enjoy the boons of harmony and peace."

  RED_begin_trade:0 "[RED.REDGetBeginTradeName]"
  RED_begin_trade_desc:0 "The Goddess has proven herself to be a powerful ally, though perhaps not a trustworthy one. We shall send her a shipment of slaves. What she does with them, we care not. This will hopefully deepen our ties, and allow us to get more insight into the inner workings of Maripony."

  RED_request_alicorns:0 "Request Alicorns"
  RED_request_alicorns_desc:0 "Unity's greatest asset is its alicorns. These majestic abominations are the height of wartime innovation, being creatures with immense arcane power and high adaptability. Perhaps if the Ministry of Arcane Sciences had been a bit quicker in developing them, the War could of ended much differently. They were not though, and now these monsters are nothing more than the puppets of the Goddess, devoid of any semblance of individuality. They can still be of great use to us though, as they are some of the deadliest creatures to exist in the Wasteland."

  RED_end_trade:0 "Doctor Glue's Experiments"
  RED_end_trade_desc:0 "Doctor Glue believes that we can replicate both the creation of alicorns and the circumstances of the Goddesses ascension. The only downside is that he will need quite a few test subjects and quite a lot of time to successfully do such. However, it will be necessary if Red Eye wishes to accomplish his ultimate ambitions."

  RED_cybernetic:0 "Doc Slaughter's Cybernetics"
  RED_cybernetic_desc:0 "Many of the greatest innovations achieved by Stable 101 were in the field of cybernetics. Over the last two centuries, they had achieved technological breakthroughs once thought to be impossible. However, over all this time, there has been no pony more experienced in the field of cybernetics than Doctor Slaughter. His expertise is as vast as his insanity, and he has proven himself to be a greatly useful asset time and time again. Now, he has once again proven his use to us, as he has developed schematics for basic cybernetics that can be mass produced and easily implanted."

  RED_imp_experiments:0 "I.M.P. Experiments"
  RED_imp_experiments_desc:0 "We unfortunately know very little regarding IMP. However, we do know that it is the only thing capable of allowing Red Eye to fully realize his ambitions. We must strive to understand this strange substance and its inner workings, so that we may safely manufacture and utilize it."

  RED_burn_everfree:0 "Burn the Everfree"
  RED_burn_everfree_desc:0 "The Everfree Forest presents a problem to us, as it separates Red Eye's Cathedral from the rest of his empire. It must be dealt with if he wishes to have a truly unified empire."

  RED_expand_influence:0 "Expand Our Reach"
  RED_expand_influence_desc:0 "The 'nations' around us are directly opposed to our expansion. They believe that they can stand against the tides of the future, defying their eventual fates. We shall show them how wrong they are by raiding their lands with impunity. If nothing else, the new slaves will provide a valuable contribution to our efforts."

  RED_old_appleloosa:0 "Old Appleloosa"
  RED_old_appleloosa_desc:0 "Old Appleloosa has been a major part of the Equestrian Slave Trade for a long time now. In fact, we have been a long time customer of theirs. However, our relationship has strictly been that of buyer and seller. That is, until now. Red Eye has ordered that we take a far greater interest in the affairs of the southern trade hub, investing in its well-being and seeking out connections among its most influential ponies."

  RED_foaltopia_gems:0 "Foal Mountains Gems"

Stern once found herself swayed by his vision as well, but she was forced to face reality once he failed to bring it about.

Already, trees are rapidly resprouting across the ashes where the wild forest once stood. We'll do another round of it, and this time we'll make sure that nothing is left standing of that accursed place. Then we'll salt the earth where it once stood, to ensure that nothing will grow there again. As our final measure, we'll build atop the land to make sure that nature can never reclaim it."

He sought to ascend beyond his lot in life, to join the ranks of those who rule. There was even a time when he dared command The Master himself. That time was long ago now, but Chainlink hasn't forgotten. How could he forget being commanded by that upstart? It's about time to remind Protégé what his true purpose is."

  RED_raiders_of_filly:0 "The Raiders of Filly"
  RED_raiders_of_filly_desc:0 "The raiders of Fillydelphia have always had an odd relationship with The Master. Since even before Red Eye's arrival, he constantly cut deals with various gangs to undermine his rivals and stir trouble throughout the city. During this time, he made connections that would last even to this day. Now, it is time to bring back some old arrangements and ensure that the raiders remain loyal to their master."

  RED_grand_reopening_desc:0 "Can you smell that? It's the smell of smog. More importantly, it's the smell of progress! With each and every factory reopened, Fillydelphia grows stronger and stronger.

  RED_raider_commanders:0 "Raiders in Command"
  RED_raider_commanders_desc:0 "A couple of the raiders have been far more useful than most. Beyond their talents, they also hold a great deal of sway over many of the other raiders.

  RED_no_more_kindness:0 "No More Kindness"
  RED_no_more_kindness_desc:0 "Some slavers are known to show sympathy to those under them. This is absolutely ridiculous. Why would we care for those who are weaker than ourselves?

  RED_blackclaws_loyalty:0 "Ensuring Blackclaw's Loyalty"
  RED_blackclaws_loyalty_desc:0 "Blackclaw is a capable griffon. It would be a real shame to see such a talent go to waste. Fortunately, it seems that not every griffon was completely taken with Stern's rulership and some are more than willing to readily accept The Master's rule. Blackclaw just so happens to be among them."

  RED_place_of_the_talons:0 "The Place of the Talons"
  RED_place_of_the_talons_desc:0 "Ever since Stern was removed, the Talons have flown around like chickens with their heads cut off.

It's about time we decide what to do with them from now on."

  RED_cult_of_personality:0 "The Master"
  RED_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria, there was a stallion by the name of Chainlink Shackles. He was, above all else, a stallion born to be a ruler. Not a ruler of nations, nor a ruler of ponies, but rather a ruler of slaves. Even his cutie mark reinforced this fact, showing this his destiny was to own slaves. He was a born master. Now, he has become much more than just another slaver. He has proven at last that he is the greatest slaver of them all, the greatest master of them all. He is no longer merely a master.  He is now §RThe Master§!."

  RED_pit_victors_desc:0 "Though everyone is born either a slaver or a slave, there are some true slavers who are unfortunately thrown in with the slaves. The Pit offers us a solution to this problem. Those who are truly slavers at heart will thrive within the Pit, while those who are too weak of spirit shall fall. Through this method, those who are born masters may ascend to our ranks."

  RED_more_pits:0 "Expand the Pit System"

  RED_army_of_slaves_desc:0 "Though slaves may be weak, they are still more than capable of holding weapons and fighting on our behalf. We shall send them into the grinder as our first line of offence. If nothing else, they'll force our foes to waste valuable ammunition."

  RED_march_to_greenline:0 "March to Greenline"
  RED_march_to_greenline_desc:0 "To the south lies all sorts of unpleasant nonsense. Hellhounds, wild swamp ponies, and impoverished fishers all occupy that land. While we usually wouldn't be tempted to fight such foes, we have little choice if we wish to secure the northern bank of the Azureway."

  RED_land_of_freedom_desc:0 "The Master once had a few friends among the Shattered Hoof Gang. Unfortunately, they were all killed or imprisoned following Gawdyna's takeover. This won't stand. It's time to bring an end to Gawdyna and her little vanity project once and for all."

  RED_empire_of_slaves:0 "An Empire Built on Slaves"
  RED_empire_of_slaves_desc:0 "Ours is an empire built upon the fundamental truths of the world. One of these truths is that it is the duty of the slaves to do as their masters order, regardless of how unpleasant it might seem. As an entirely random example, when The Master orders the slaves to build new roads, they do not question. They simply get to work."

  RED_great_network:0 "The Great Slaver Network"
  RED_great_network_desc:0 "We have more slaves than most of the rest of Equestria combined. So long as the slave trade keeps going, every slave shall one day find themselves being brought to our great city. It is here that they shall finally fulfill their potential to their fullest."

  RED_mom_secrets:0 "Secrets of the MoM"
  RED_mom_secrets_desc:0 "The Master was never one for history, but even he knows of the Ministries of the old world. One of these Ministries, the so-called Ministry of Morale, was involved in all sorts of questionable activities. Mass surveillance, counterespionage, and memory magic were among the many things they were in charge of. It's as if they were after The Master's own heart."

  RED_spybots:0 "Spybots"
  RED_spybots_desc:0 "These spritebots can be modified to be even better than they currently are! By adding a few more attenas to the top and putting those giant towering eyesores that dot the Wasteland to use, we can create a spy network that stretches far beyond our own territory."

  RED_new_deal_with_era_desc:0 "Red Eye had some arrangements with the Bloody Army. We have no plan on honoring these arrangements. Instead, they shall be given a different deal. Either they accept it or they make an enemy of The Master."

  RED_deal_with_ncg:0 "Deal with the Guilds"
  RED_deal_with_ncg_desc:0 "The Neocastle Guilds already understand how the world works. Though they don't use the word slave, their ponies are essentially such. They work long shifts each and every day for uncaring masters who exist simply to control them. Bringing them into the fold would be a fairly simple affair. All they must do is accept The Master as their true ruler."

  RED_slaver_marriage:0 "A Proposal to Blood Mane"
  RED_slaver_marriage_desc:0 "The Bloody Army still holds an illusion of being independent from us. To tie them to us now and forever, The Master shall send a marriage proposal to Blood Mane.

  RED_master_to_slaves_desc:0 "There are many slavers who do not meet our expectations. Some slack off, some do chems when they think we're not looking, and some are simply just bad at their jobs.

  RED_gather_the_companies:0 "Gather the Companies"
  RED_gather_the_companies_desc:0 "Old records and chicks tales tell of great gatherings, where the highest ranking members of a unified Talon Company would all come together and discuss the future of the Company. It's time that we do something that hasn't been done since the Great War: Call a Talon Company board meeting."

  RED_redwings_absence:0 "Redwing's Absence"
  RED_redwings_absence_desc:0 "It seems that one notable Talon has declined to attend our meeting. Unfortunately, this has been noticed by other Talons as well, who are beginning to doubt their own attendance..."

  RED_the_grimtalons:0 "The Grimtalons"
  RED_the_grimtalons_desc:0 "Gawdyna Grimfeathers. The very name makes Stern's blood boil. Unfortunately, she has cemented herself as a major player within Talon Company politics. Though she hasn't showed up herself, her ideas are still very much present."

  RED_talon_history:0 "Mercenary History"
  RED_talon_history_desc:0 "If there is one thing that many of these griffons care about, it is their pride. As part of this, they also take great pride in their history and their knowledge of it. Now that these griffons are beginning to ask questions that are rather difficult to answer, we can pull out our ace in the hole and avoid having to answer any of them."

  RED_fund_his_enemies:0 "Fund His Enemies"
  RED_fund_his_enemies_desc:0 "Redwing's insult has not been forgotten, nor will it be forgotten for some time. To make things harder on him, we will approach the raiders and nations surrounding him and begin investing in their development. Though they may be pony nations, we would sooner work with ponies than traitors."

  RED_hunt_them_down:0 "Hunt Them Down"
  RED_hunt_them_down_desc:0 "It seems that our griffons were not as loyal as we would of hoped. Some look to the likes of Gawdyna as an inspiration, as if her pathetic 'democracy' was anything more than a way to give the masses the illusion of holding power. In reality, her nation is far more similar to ours than she would ever admit. Unfortunately, not everygriff sees it this way. Those who still advocate for Gawdyna's system shall need to be removed from our ranks, lest they continue to spread their foolish beliefs."

  RED_talon_forever_and_always:0 "Talon, Forever and Always"
  RED_talon_forever_and_always_desc:0 "We are the Talons! For countless generations, we have slain all who stood before us. For profit, for glory, for love, it matters not! What matters is our legacy, and the legacy of all griffonkind. We must carry on this legacy into the future."

  RED_secure_foothills:0 "Secure the Foothills"
  RED_secure_foothills_desc:0 "The pony tribes of the north are nothing short of an insult to all of civilization. They sit there, scrounging around in the mud worshiping their nature spirits. It's like they've somehow gone backwards in evolution! Though perhaps this is simply the true form of ponykind, laid bare for all to see. Regardless, they will make good slaves."

  RED_everfree_question:0 "Ultimatum to the Dogs"
  RED_everfree_question_desc:0 "The hellhounds of the Everfree Forest are a rather unreasonable bunch, prone to killing anygriff who dares enter their territory. We would really rather not waste valuable lives on dealing with them, especially since nothing short of our best may be capable of doing so. To try to avoid that, we will instead send the dogs an offer to avoid unnecessary bloodshed."

  RED_exploiting_mountains:0 "Exploiting the Mountains"
  RED_exploiting_mountains_desc:0 "With the tribal lands under our control, we can now begin exploiting their natural resources for all their worth. A few trusted griffons shall be appointed as the new mining foregriffs and given the funding to establish operations across the mountains."

  RED_legacy_of_griffonstone:0 "The Legacy of Griffonstone"
  RED_legacy_of_griffonstone_desc:0 "Ancient tales tell of a city of wealth and prosperity known as Griffonstone. It is said to be the very birthplace of griffonkind, a land that the Gods themselves blessed. Unfortunately, this city has faded into legend over the centuries. We doubt it still stands today. Even if it did, it is impossibly far away, across a vast expanse of ocean that stretches on for far longer than any of us can see. So we shall just build our own Griffonstone, right here on our new land. It shall become a shining beacon, just like that city of old."

  RED_long_march:0 "The Long March"
  RED_long_march_desc:0 "The tribals have proven useful as miners, but the mines can only use so many slaves at once. Many of their proud warriors also refuse to work, instead trying to maintain some semblance of resistance against our rule. Just because they can't be of use up there, doesn't mean we can't use them within Fillydelphia instead..."

  RED_deal_with_bloody_army:0 "Deal With the Bloody Army"
  RED_deal_with_bloody_army_desc:0 "To the south lies a band of raiders known as the Bloody Army. Red Eye planned on working with them, using them as a means to bring New Mareway down. Why would we rely on a bunch of murderers and thugs to do this though when we can just deal with New Mareway ourselves?"

  RED_burn_new_mareway:0 "New Mareway Burns"
  RED_burn_new_mareway_desc:0 "The ponies of New Mareway continue to plot against us and resist our rule. Little do they know that we are well aware of their plots and which ponies are behind them. It's time to show them the price of defiance."

  RED_restore_griffon_nobility:0 "Restore Griffon Nobility"
  RED_restore_griffon_nobility_desc:0 "Long ago, the Griffonian Empire stood as one of the greatest nations to ever exist. It was kept running thanks to the efforts of the nobility, a class of griffons who were the cream of the crop. They each administered their own domains, but all made oaths of loyalty to the Griffonian Emperor. With Stern filling the role of the Griffonian Empress, perhaps it wouldn't be a bad idea to bring this system back once more."

  #Red Eye Dead at war Tree

  RED_chainlink_w_political:0 "The New Master"
  RED_chainlink_w_political_desc:0 "This is truly a dark time. Red Eye and Stern are both dead, and Fillydelphia is in a time of crisis. We have little choice but to turn to Chainlink Shackles for any semblance of order within this chaos."

  RED_chainlink_w_rally_talons:0 "Filling Stern's Place"
  RED_chainlink_w_rally_talons_desc:0 "Stern was the strong leader who many looked towards as the new Mistress of Fillydelphia. However, if she was so strong, then how come she isn't still with us now? Shackles is more than worthy to fill her spot, and he has no intention of failing like she did."

  RED_chainlink_w_rally_raiders:0 "Rally the Raiders"
  RED_chainlink_w_rally_raiders_desc:0 "Under Red Eye, the raiders of Fillydelphia were kept on a close leash. Under Stern, this would of been taken even further. But Shackles? Under him, the raiders may feel free to give in to their most depraved and wild desires. So long as they continue following orders, of course."

  RED_chainlink_w_secure_slaves:0 "Secure Fillydelphia"
  RED_chainlink_w_secure_slaves_desc:0 "The city at the heart of our empire must be secured, no matter what. Order shall be restored, the slaves shall be reminded of who's in charge here, and the walls shall be resecured. Fillydelphia will not fall today."

  RED_chainlink_w_secure_cathedral:0 "Remove Cathedral Autonomy"
  RED_chainlink_w_secure_cathedral_desc:0 "The Cathedral has suffered heavy damage, and most of the ponies which once resided inside of it are now dead. It will be no problem to simply march in and occupy the structure with our own loyal slavers."

  RED_chainlink_w_total_war:0 "Finish the Fight"
  RED_chainlink_w_total_war_desc:0 "Chainlink Shackles has proven himself to be the right stallion to lead Fillydelphia. Now it is time for him to do his duty and save his city from those who would see it destroyed."

  #Red Eye Dead at peace Tree

  RED_chainlink_political:0 "Filling the Void"
  RED_chainlink_political_desc:0 "A power vacuum has been created within Fillydelphia. One which Chainlink Shackles aims to fill. Rallying the slavers to his side, he prepares to consolidate his power over the city."

  RED_chainlink_restore_order:0 "Restore Order"
  RED_chainlink_restore_order_desc:0 "The death of Red Eye was enough to send shockwaves through the slaves and slavers alike. The rapidly following death of Stern then made things far worse, as the slaves became rebellious while the slavers became demoralized. This won't be tolerated within Chainlink Shackle's Fillydelphia. Order will be restored, and everypony will be forced back into line."

  RED_chainlink_secure_talons:0 "Securing the Talons"
  RED_chainlink_secure_talons_desc:0 "Without Stern, the Talons have fallen into disarray. They are in dire need of a strong leader. It just so happens that Fillydelphia now has one."

  RED_chainlink_raider_leaders:0 "Promote Loyal Raiders"
  RED_chainlink_raider_leaders_desc:0 "Chainlink is not beyond consorting with raiders to further his own goals. Though they are always a bit of an unpredictable bunch, they can be very agreeable so long as you can promise them something they'd want. In exchange for a few such promises, the raider population of Fillydelphia can be swayed into supporting their new Master's rule."

  RED_chainlink_factories:0 "Doubling Down on Industry"
  RED_chainlink_factories_desc:0 "We can not let the slaves get content and lazy. Even working as hard as they did when Red Eye still ruled is not enough. They must work harder, move faster, and help us save our industry."

  RED_chainlink_master:0 "The Master"
  RED_chainlink_master_desc:0 "Chainlink Shackles has consolidated his position as the Master of Fillydelphia."

 RED_restore_sparkle_cola_desc:0 "During the War, the Ministry of Arcane Sciences found itself constantly in need of increased funding. There simply weren't enough bits for them to pursue many of their pursuits, something that was a constant hinderance to their efforts. As a solution to this problem, they devised a brilliant idea: They would establish a soda company! Sparkle Cola quickly became one of the most widespread and beloved beverages in Equestria, and the influx of bits was more than enough to fund the Ministry's pursuits. Perhaps we could do something similar today."

 RED_restore_hippocampus_desc:0 "Hippocampus Energy was Equestria's leading electric company, both before and during the War. As the nation's energy needs increased, so too did governmental pressure on Hippocampus. Ultimately, this led to their company being bought out by a subsidiary of the Ministry of Wartime Technology. Their operations were only expanded drastically from there, and they soon has a presence in just about every town in Equestria. We have already been utilizing several of their power plants across Fillydelphia, and it wouldn't be too difficult to formally reopen the company."
 RED_hippocampus_hydroelectric:0 "Rebuild The Hippocampus Dam"
 RED_hippocampus_hydroelectric_desc:0 "Before the War, Equestria relied heavily on coal to fill the majority of its energy needs. There were many attempts to try to find an alternative source of energy, from the so-called 'air parks' to attempts at drawing power from the sun itself. One of these attempts came in the form of the Hippocampus Dam, a massive wall of concrete that could draw power from water. Unfortunately, it was found too inefficient and was abandoned shortly after its completion. Unlike those ponies of the old world, we understand the value of even the smallest bit of electricity, and consider reopening this dam to be high priority."

In the distance, he could see the flames and smoke of the vast foundries that supplied his army with steel. Over the sounds of industry, the occasional gunshot could be heard.

Another casualty of Fillydelphia.\n\nSo many deaths, so much suffering, and all of it because of him. Because of what he had done, because of what he had created. This level of suffering was unthinkable before the war!\n\nAnd yet, the wasteland claimed just as much responsibility as he did. Out there, ponies suffered and died just the same as they would within the walls of Fillydelphia. Only the wasteland had been inflicting pain and suffering for over 200 years now, with no end in sight. No end, that is, until he came along. With each life given in Fillydelphia, another is saved down the line.

Within a year, it is entirely possible that the vast majority of the assembled soldiers will have died in Red Eye's name.\n\nThey were not the first. Nor would they be the last.

Now, as Red Eye looks upon the thousands of half-dead trees that is the Everfree, he knows that it stands in the way of his ambitions, and that finally doing away with the bane that is the Everfree is the only solution.

Instead, she would rule from within the heart of her city.\n\n To this end, she has ordered that the Alpha-Omega hotel be repaired and renovated to serve as the new administrative hub of Fillydelphia. The facility is located in a central point, still has a number of fortifications still standing around it, and is easily accessible to griffons. The only downside is its current state of disrepair.\n\n The damage it has suffered is primarily due to it being a major target during the Great Revolt, with many slaves seeking to find and 'save' their children.

He had been the cause of many a problem for her before, but this was crossing a line! She would not stand for this. Across from her sat the stallion himself, just as grimey and vile as always. And around them stood a number of Fillydelphia's most elite slavers, all powerful and feared mares and stallions from across Fillydelphia. Shackle's had presented her his conditions. They were simple: She was to turn over much of Fillydelphia's stockpiled equipment to slaver guards, to help secure the protection of Fillydelphia. In exchange Shackle's would personally ensure every slave in Fillydelphia would be hard at work by tomorrow. Refuse, and their vacation would be extended as long as he deemed necessary. And of course, he wished to broadcast these terms and her acceptance of them across all of Fillydelphia, for the slavers and Talons alike to witness.\n\nShe knew there was little she could do. Though her griffons were certainly capable, they lacked the sheer numbers necessary to force the slaves and slavers back to work.

A rebellion was underway, with The Pit being at the center of it. Slaves from all over Fillydelphia were now rioting, beating down slavers left and right. What was initially believed to be a minor riot had rapidly spiralled out of control, as slaver forces were beaten back again and again. Several checkpoints had already fallen, and the slaves had obtained a number of guns via looting them from the corpses of slavers.\n\nThe situation would only continue to grow more and more out of control if immediate action wasn't taken. However, much to the ire of one particular stallion observing the situation from a temporary field command center, those responsible for taking that action were refusing to do so. The courier that had the unfortunate duty of delivering Stern's message to Shackle's had not lived long enough to carry his reply. A slaver stood rooted in place, ready to take up the couriers duty, and silently praying he did not meet a similar fate.\n\nShackles, despite outward appearances, was hardly stupid. He recognized when he was backed in a corner, and he knew that there was only one real option available to him: to accept Stern's demands, effectively placing large portions of Fillydelphia's industry and, more importantly its slavers, under her direct command and oversight. To do otherwise was to risk this pathetic slave rebellion spiralling ever more out of control, until such a point where it directly threatened even him.

It wouldn't take more than an hour, and they'd be back within Fillydelphia proper in no time.\n\n Their first stop was nothing more than a simple salvaging operation, putting ponies to use to sift through the ruins of Fillydelphia and find anything of potential value. There's rarely any sort of trouble with these operations, especially not this close to the Wall. Yet when they flew down to the makeshift camp being used to manage this effort, they couldn't find a single soul in sight.\n\n Then the shooting began. One round from an anti-machine rifle proved more than enough to splatter the captain's brains across the pavement. From there, it was all chaos.\n\n They tried to recover and fight, but before even one of them could get a shot off, half of their griffs were already dead. Latefeather, a lovely chick that had caught his eye for some time, was the first to call for what was left of their patrol to get the cluck out of there. Of course, she was also the next to go down in a spray of bullets. He made sure to take her last words to heart though, and tried to fly out of there as fast as his wings could carry him. He even made it some distance, before a round came flying out of a nearby ruin and hit his wing.\n\n Here he was now, lying against an old ruin with an injured wing and likely half a dozen broken bones.

Finding out who stood where, discovering which seemingly trustworthy slavers were secretly within their rivals camp, and seeing who could be swayed away from his influence. Tonight, that list was put to use.\n\n Nine supervisors found themselves dying in unfortunate accidents. They were quickly replaced by underlings who promised to not only continue their work, but see to it that it was carried out more efficiently than ever before.\n\n Four respected overseers were replaced by loyal griffons. Two of them had been awoken by a rapping of a claw at their door, followed by a bullet. One of them had fallen into a parasprite pit. The last had been brought before his peers and tried guilty of aiding a slave resistance movement. His punishment was to have his tongue cut out and to join those slaves he had aided. The evidence was, of course, flimsy. But any who would oppose the ruling happened to not be present.\n\n Come the next day, Chainlink would find many of his less devout supporters having turned their backs on him,  thanks to the generous benefits of being in Stern's good graces.

However, those days were long gone, and his influence had been limited to such a degree that he could barely keep his own activities hidden from us, let alone that of other slavers.\n\n A string of investigations provided us with more than enough evidence to justify the demotion or even execution of several dozen slavers. Drinking on duty and taking bribes were the least of these offences, with many of them being guilty of conspiring against Stern and her Talons. We made sure to make it very clear to them what the usual punishment for such behavior is.\n\n Rather than enact justice though, Stern has instead opted to extend mercy and forgiveness to them. All they must do is clean up their act and cease all association with Shackles. We would continue to keep an eye on them, of course, and those who had been involved in killing our griffons would still find themselves suffering unfortunate accidents, but most of them would be free to carry on their duties as normal.\n\n Most of them found this arrangement to be beyond agreeable, and Chainlink has found himself losing even more friends."

A fear that was only partially justified, as the guards still under Shackle's employ were quick to throw down their weapons and surrender to our griffons, rather than die trying to fight against them. Chainlink had barricaded himself within an old supply room within the tunnels, which his disloyal guards were quick to point out the location of.\n\n It seems he had planted numerous traps in the tunnel leading up to his land stand. It took our finest little time to deal with them though, and they quickly found the once proud slaver cowering in his little holdout. However, like any cornered animal, he fought tooth and hoof against us. Equipped in a suit of heavy metal armor and armed with a small armory worth of weaponry, he managed to kill four of our griffons before a well placed shot from an anti-machine rifle finally took him down.\n\n His death would barely even cause a stir, and with him gone, Stern's authority was at last absolute."

redeye.79.desc:0 "Chainlink unfortunately still clung to power like the overgrown rat he was. His many persistent connections made it difficult to get close to him, difficult to find any evidence against him, and would bring untold consequences if she tried to remove him. So, a different solution had to be found. One that would removed him as a threat, without stepping on too many hooves or antagonizing him too much. This solution would come in the form of a promotion.\n\n Felmeadow was not a priority position. It was home to some salvaging operations, some minor manufacturing, and a decent deal of farming. The food it produced was only slightly more than what was necessary to keep them running, and it produced nowhere near enough of anything else to really be considered worth our attention. As a result, it had been largely neglected, and lacked any sort of central management. That was to change now.\n\n By order of Stern herself, Chainlink Shackles was to be recognized for his outstanding achievements in the service of Fillydelphia. He had had a long history of effectively and efficiently overseeing countless positions, keeping numerous slaves in line, and ensuring that our great city was still able to function to its fullest potential. As his reward for all of these accomplishments, he would be granted a promotion to Chief Overseer of all of Felmeadow. He was expected to turn their operations around, making Felmeadow one of the greatest of all our domains. His promotion was effective immediately, and he would be expected to leave for his new post by tomorrow."

No longer would she have to deal with their constant ambushes or their attempts to disrupt Fillydelphia salvaging operations.\n\n However, there was another unexpected benefit to having finally dealt with the power armored menace. One of their members, a mare calling herself Nova Rage, had proven open to the idea of actually joining Stern's cause. While all of the grief caused by the Rangers in the past would normally lead her to order this mare's immediate execution, the potential benefits of having well-trained power armored soldiers at her disposal proved to be more than enough to convince her otherwise. Not only this, but Nova Rage herself also seemed to be very agreeable, and was more than willing to embrace many of Stern's ideals.\n\n Their negotiations ended up going very smoothly, and were soon followed by orders to provide Nova Rage with the resources she would need to locate other Steel Ranger remnants and organize them under her cause."

As a reward for her efforts, she and her band were granted limited autonomy and gifted their former land and assets.\n\n From the courtyard of the Stable-Tec Headquarters, Stern and Nova Rage issued a joint-speech to the gathered Rangers and Talons. In it, they expressed a desire to see the Steel Rangers live on as friends to Fillydelphia rather than foes, and promised to further their cooperation with one another. At the end of the speech, Stern declared that from this day onwards, what was left of the Fillydelphia Chapter of the Steel Rangers would now be known as 'Stern's Rangers', and would continue to serve Fillydelphia into the future.\n\n We look forward to great things from the newly declared organization, who we expect to serve us well in the days to come."

However, since the passing of Red Eye, our relationship with her has been uncertain.\n\n Today, Stern has cleared that uncertainty up by sending an envoy to her. The offer she has presented is rather simple: Fillydelphia's full backing and support, and a mutual alliance between their armies. With this backing, the Bloody Army was expected to launch a full invasion of New Mareway immediately, eliminating Stern's most immediate southern rival. We expect to hear back from the warlord herself at some point soon."

They were all bulky, towering over most normal ponies and with hooves larger than most skulls. What they wore could hardly be considered to be proper uniforms, instead being a mishmash of scrap plates and spikes, all painted with blood to bring the look together. Stern's guards stood in direct contrast to them, being composed entirely of griffons who were equally as intimidating. Their faces couldn't be seen behind their reinforced riot helmets, each of them carried Fillydelphia's iconic anti-machine rifles, and they all went about their duty with professionalism and silence. The two very different groups stood guard outside Blood Mane's new palace, where Stern and her were currently discussing what could only be the utmost important of business.\n\n 'The fucker doubted me! Told me it was impossible to kill someone with their own femur! Well, you can guess who got to become a live demonstration. I don't know if the little bitch screamed more when I ripped it out or when I began swinging!' Laughter erupted from the warlord as she finished her story, with Stern following suit. The very first thing the two leaders had done was break out the finest liquor that could be found in the overstocked basements of the New Mareway nobility. Since then, they had taken to swapping tales and having a time of merriment. As her laughter came to an end, Blood Mane gave her compatriot a more sober look.\n\n 'Y'know Stern, you're a real cool bird. Red Eye was a real charmer, and a good lookin' stallion at that, but he never would'a agreed to this 'ere meeting. But I gotta ask, what's your game?' The griffon considered the question for a moment, before responding.\n 'Well, first things first, I'm going to put an end to those upstarts in Shattered Hoof. They believe themselves to be great, to be an unstoppable force of good in the world. Well, they'll get what's coming to them soon enough. And I hope I can rely on your support in that.' A nod from the mare, before Stern continued. 'After that, I think I'll be content to just enjoy ruling over my empire. Maybe have more outings like this, enjoy my time a bit more once all of the pressing issues have been dealt with.'\n\n Blood Mane nodded once more, before throwing back half a bottle of several-century old brandy. With that bit of serious discussion out of the way, they could go back to their merriment."

However, to the surprise of many, he has instead been granted a supply of slaves to experiment on and all of the resources he would like for his bizarre experiments.

One stallion in particular still held enough sway and influence to very easily become a thorn in Stern's side, though he had thus far remained largely quiet regarding her rule.\n\n Protégé, being Red Eye's personal student, was quietly regarded as his successor by many who still remained loyal to the stallion, even if none would dare voice that in the open. To make matters even worse, many of the slaves still regarded him in a more favourable light than the other overseers, due to his well known sympathies for them. When combined, these two factors gave him more than enough room to make a power grab against Stern, should he so wish.\n\n As such, he would be dealt with. His personal physician may have been fond of him, but he was nowhere near fond enough to give up his own life. A polite chat, an unmarked syringe, and within a week Protégé would be found dead. An investigation would find one of the slavers under him to be responsible for poisoning him. This traitor would be executed the following day."

While this fall was nowhere near enough to kill such an endurant stallion, the resulting kick from the brahmin he had disturbed ended up embedding a hoof into his skull. It took the slavers several minutes to reach him, and he died well before they could get him to a doctor.\n\n Needless to say, Stern was overjoyed by the news. Shackle's lackey's were quick to retreat into the shadows to try and figure out where to go from here, while many griffons have taken to open celebration of the despised slaver's death."

Among the other Children of the Cathedral, she had gained quite the reputation as a zealous fanatic, willing to give her life for Master Red Eye's will. So, when Chainlink Shackles requested to meet with one of the Children, Shine was a natural choice to send.\n\n The meeting would take place in a seemingly abandoned building on the outskirts of Fillydelphia, well outside the Wall and far away from the ears of the Talons. The guards outside were dressed like scavengers and appeared at ease, but they immediately became fully alert as soon as Shine approached. What followed was a brief exchange, before Shine was ushered into the crumbling building behind them. Stepping inside, Shine was immediately greeted by a bulky stallion holding a binder. The pleasantries were quickly dealt with, and the proper meeting began.\n\n 'As you know, the Master is prepared to take full control of Fillydelphia. When the time comes, you will support us. In exchange, we will allow you the privilege of living under the Master's rule.' Before Shine could retort, the stallion continued. 'We also will not harm the foals.' Following this statement, the stallion held out a folder to Shine. With a growing feeling of dread, she took it from his hoof and slowly opened it.\n\n Her blood ran cold as she saw photo after photo of Red Eye's children. Those that he had saved from the Wasteland and was having raised to become the rebuilders of the world. As she saw photo after photo, the stallion spoke once more. 'The Master is reasonable. If the Cathedral pledges its loyalty to him, these foals will be allowed to enjoy the same luxuries they had under Red Eye. Otherwise, they shall be dealt with. I believe that is all we needed to discuss. You may leave.'"

Their most prominent ponies were from families who had been involved in the slave trade for generations. Some of their ancestors had even known and traded with Chainlink Shackle's own. To make things even easier, griffons were not at all popular among the southern slavers.

Once upon a time, she led her Talons into battle, directly fighting Steel Rangers and raiders. Once upon a time, she had the time and freedom to do all that, and so much more. Those times have long since passed.\n\n Nowadays, it took all of Stern's efforts and all of her attention to keep Fillydelphia from falling apart. This meant she spent most of her time behind a desk, sending our orders and delegating to other griffons to keep such a large scale operation running. Despite this, it seemed that things were only getting worse and worse day after day, and her grip was only continuing to slip.\n\n Her musings were interrupted by a gunshot outside. Jumping to attention, she rapidly grabbed her gun and took cover behind her desk, anticipating a fight. Minutes passed without a single sound, until there was a knocking on the door, followed by a voice. 'All clear, ma'am! A slaver tried to shoot his way in, but we stopped him!'\n\n Recognizing the speaker as one of her guards, the griffon slowly stood and approached the door. As she moved to open it, a single shot echoed out as the anti-machine round pierced through Stern's torso. The door blew open from the impact, and the last thing Stern would see was the smiling face of Chainlink Shackles as he stood behind her traitorous guard.\n\n News would spread quickly of Stern's death, and the most powerful slavers across Fillydelphia met within an hour to discuss their future.

Even more scared.\n\n For a small group of slaves under the lead of Shackles' old slave, Protege, life changed dramatically. Even more ponies desperately attempted to escape the hellish walls of Fillydelphia, now that it was fully under The Master's control. None would be able to avoid the guards.\n\n Protege himself was crushed by the news of his master's death. His voice suddenly lost all his authority, and the slaves he managed became more and more uneasy every day. Now was the perfect time for Shackles to reclaim what rightfully belonged to him.\n\n §R\"UPSTART!\"§! The powerful slaver's voice resounded as he and his personal guard stepped into the walls of the mall. Weak, malnourished, and terrified slaves quickly hid away in their booths while soldiers filed out into the main hall of the building.

However, he demands that we change our schedule quite drastically, with us being expected to invade New Mareway in a month. To make our odds better, Chainlink has pledged Fillydelphia's full support. However, that doesn't change the fact that this is extremely short notice, and could end in disaster for us.\n\n This deal has also come with a simple threat: if we do not accept, we will face the consequences. The exact words given in regards to what these consequences entail include 'wishing you were dying on the banks of the Azureway'.

Once the war was over, once the bodies had been counted, there would hardly be enough ponies left alive to fight back against Fillydelphia's rule. Not among those pathetic worms living on the Azureway, and certainly not among Blood Mane's forces, who would be stretched thin trying to rule over their new domain.

If anything, he looked increasingly happy towards the letter before him.\n\n 'Well, well. Blood Mane's got some bite after all. Let's teach her why dogs shouldn't bite their Master.'

Following our change in management, this policy not only continued, but was considered a priority. An ever-increasing amount of slaves and resources have been committed to discovering and salvaging old Ministry of Morale facilities. The reason for this was known only to the upper echelon of slavers, but it seems their efforts have finally borne fruit.\n\n Within the heart of Fillydelphia, several notable slavers gathered. They were all respected supervisors, who had overseen a great many slaves, slavers, and operations over the many years that they had been serving Fillydelphia. Yet they were all nothing compared to the one true Master of Fillydelphia, who could strike fear into even their hearts. It was him who they uneasily waited for.\n\n Most of them acted unphased as he shoved his way through the doorway to the meeting room. 'Alright, I'm here! You better of had a damn good reason to call me all the way out here.'\n\n The gathered slavers looked nervously at one another, before one of them spoke. 'Of course, Master. We would like to report that we have found something from the Ministry of Morale. We believe we have found one of their interrogation blacksites, hidden beneath the old balloon factory.

Well, you see, we believe that we can use what we've found to develop our own memory manipulation spells. We could remove memories, add memories, or even alter existing memories. With this, we can pull memories from our enemies or create perfectly loyal and obedient slaves...'\n\n At this, a horribly malicious smile appeared on The Master. 'Perfectly obedient slaves? You will have all you need for this. I expect results as soon as possible.' The slavers response, hesitant and weak, was one of warning. 'Sir...we fear there might be some unfortunate side effects-.\n\n This time, Chainlink's interruption would not be subtle, but rather with a shout of rage. 'Side effects!? Side effects! Who gives a flying buck about the slaves suffering side effects!? You are to provide results, or you will join those slaves you seem to care so much about!'

'N-no, Master.'\n\n Chainlink almost allowed a smile to cross his face at this. 'That's right. I did not. But because you want to know, I'll tell you.'

Following her seventh threat to personally castrate Shackles if he ever takes a single step within her domain, one of the slavers interrupted the angered warlord to announce the reason for their presence.\n\n 'To the 'lovely and beautiful' Warlord Blood Mane, a letter from Chainlink Shackles.' This stopped the raider in her tracks, as she quickly processed what they had said. With a shout of 'Give me that!', she roughly pulled the letter away from the slaver holding it and began reading through. What she read was certainly far different from what she expected.\n\n A series of unflattering 'poems' that often related to slavery or ownership in some way or form, followed by 'compliments' that would make even the most desperate mares run away in fear, and finally, a simple question about unifying their two factions. With that one final line, Blood Mane knew all she needed regarding Shackle's intentions. Rather than conquer the Bloody Army through war, he wanted to take them in a more peaceful manner. On the flipside, this would give Blood Mane more influence and control over Fillydelphia as well, though she was certain her power would be greatly limited. And of course, the thought of actually marrying such a disgusting stallion is the substance of nightmares.\n\n §RBesides, he surely wouldn't handle her rejection that poorly, right?§!"

redeye.106.desc:0 "Not a moment was wasted after Chainlink Shackles received Blood Mane's acceptance. A hundred slaves were put to work building a grand building for their ceremony, complete with numerous hastily constructed statues of himself looking down upon the slaves below. A hundred of his best slavers were called in and prepared for this event, being stationed all around the new ceremonial hall with a variety of heavy weaponry. Invitations were sent out to all of the high ranking slavers within Fillydelphia, informing them that their attendance would be mandatory. The final preparation would be finding a preacher among the slaves, which proved to be easier than expected. At last, their ceremony could begin.\n\n Chainlink stood there, wearing a ragged old suit that he had lying around. The thing barely fit him, and was covered in all sorts of unsavoury stains, but nopony would dare say anything about it. Looking down the aisle, which had guards forming a solid wall around it, he was met with the sight of Blood Mane herself trotting towards him. Her own attire was even less formal than his, just being the same armor she always wore. As she came to stand next to him, the preacher began to speak.\n\n 'We gather here today to witness a union between two...notable individuals.' At this, Blood Mane interrupted with 'Can we just get this over with?' \n\n The preacher resumed speaking. 'As you wish. Chainlink Shackles, Master of Fillydelphia, with the Goddesses as your witnesses, do you take Blood Mane to be your lawfully wedded wife?' His smile was devoid of anything resembling wholesome happiness as he simply stated 'I do.' Turning towards Blood Mane, the preacher continued. 'Blood Mane, Warlord of the Bloody Army, with the Goddesses as your witnesses, do you take Chainlink Shackles to be your lawfully wedded husband?' At this, Blood Mane remained silent. Did she really want to go through with this, to give this bastard her hoof in their marriage, even if only symbolically so? Her hesitancy was forced to an end by a reminder of the situation she was in, through one of The Master's guards lifting the barrel of their rifle in her direction. 'I do.'\n\n 'May Celestia and Luna bless your union, and may they see to it that you may spend the rest of your days together, until death do you part. You may now kiss the bride.' Chainlink Shackles wasted no time before grabbing his new spouse and forcing her lips against his."

How could one stallion ever hope to unite the many gangs and warlords that ruled over Fillydelphia? How could a naive stable dweller seek to build an empire, like the Wasteland had never seen before? However, with much convincing, Chainlink had agreed to his proposals. A decision that was proven correct, as that pony did what was thought impossible.\n\n Now, Chainlink stood at the head of an even greater empire, built on the ruins of that stable dweller's vision. He was the most powerful stallion in all of Equestria, the true Master of ponykind itself. None could escape his grasp, and all were his slaves! Even if they didn't know it yet. For that was their roles, their purpose for existing: to be slaves. And it was The Master's purpose to rule over them.

After all, our paladins had killed more than a few of the Talons over the years.\n\n It seems our fears were unfounded though, as a griffon arrived earlier this morning with an offer of an alliance from Stern. It seems she believes it would be in the best interest of both Fillydelphia and ourselves if we simply let bygones be bygones, and instead trot into the future together. This offer is truly too good to be true!\n\n Which is exactly what some of our paladins are worried about. They warn that we can't trust a griffon to hold their word, and that giving Fillydelphia even an inch will result in them trying to take a mile. Now the question must be asked: Can we trust Stern?"

They were very mistaken in their foolish belief that their traditions would be enough to save them, a lesson they were quick to learn once their best warriors fell to our forces.\n\n However, despite the ease with which we conquered their tribes, actually managing the land has proven to be much more difficult than we would like. We simply don't know the layout anywhere near as well as the natives, who have taken to constantly ambushing our patrols and sabotaging our operations. This has led to us being severely limited in what we can actually do with the land. Fortunately, a solution has presented itself: If we can not rule the land with the natives on it, why don't we just simply remove the natives? With this, a plan was set into motion.\n\n Countless tribals marched in chains, being prodded and forced along by an army of talons. Their destination was still a long ways away, but they would be kept marching until the smog-filled skies of Fillydelphia were overhead. When the slavers had shown up and began to round them all up, there had been resistance. They had fought back, of course. Examples were quickly made though, and the rest fell in line once it became clear that their only other option would be death.\n\n Occasionally, a griffon would fly overhead. They paid no mind to the marching tribals below, instead heading towards the lands they had just been forcibly removed from. They feared what their purpose may be, but their questions regarding such were met with beatings from the slavers escorting them. Though they worried that the griffons were going to do horrible things to their homes and those they left behind, the truth was somewhat less horrid: They were surveyors, being sent out to inspect the land. Only the first stage in a long process of organizing all of the land for sale to any griffon with enough caps and the will to settle down."

Quite frankly, we're tired of it. Starting today, any effort to undermine our rule will not be tolerated. To help drive in that point, Stern has ordered an example to be made of what happens to those who oppose us.\n\n The first building to burn was the royal palace, with many of the conniving nobles still inside. With any luck, their numbers would be thinned dramatically, and the survivors would take this as a warning. Stern herself was responsible for setting the fire.\n\nThe second target was much less ornate, being a simple tavern tucked away in an alleyway within the capital. It was here, in this run down centuries old bar, that the NMLF held their meetings. One such meeting just so happened to be going on as our attack began.\n\n The third target was much more indiscriminate, simply being the city as a whole. Griffons dropped a mix of proper firebombs and simple torches on rooftops all across the city, setting numerous buildings ablaze. Homes, businesses, and even schoolhouses all burned alike."

Within the Equestrian heartland alone, there were numerous different independent companies operating. Unfortunately, they all operated entirely independently of one another, with even communication between different companies being very rare.\n\n Looking out across her vast domain, Stern decided that this state of affairs must change. A unified central Talon Company would emerge once more, and she would be its leader. Turning to one of her trusted Talons, she gave the order: Invitations are to be sent out to all other companies of note. The occasion? A Talon Company Board Meeting, the likes of which have not been seen since before the War.

Hardly a dozen griffons had actually shown up to her meeting, though she knew that many of them had many more griffons under their command. One particularly notable absence was that of Redwing, who was a fairly renowned and well-respected Talon even among his peers.\n\n The unspoken question regarding his absence would be unexpectedly answered by a griffon being escorted into the meeting room by one of Stern's own griffons. Upon being brought before the Mistress of Fillydelphia, the griffon turned slightly towards the rest of the room and loudly announced himself.\n\n 'I am here on behalf of Redwing! He wishes to express his regret at not being able to show up to this get-together, but he is unfortunately far too busy doing his duty in Summerfield to bother with humoring the illusions of grandeur possessed by a madgriff.'\n\n At this, the other assembled griffons began quietly speaking to one another, many of them expressing doubts regarding Stern and Redwing alike. This would come to an end due to the intervention of a visibly angered Stern.\n\n 'If he is too much of a chick to see what I am trying to do here, that is entirely on him! We are here not for me, but to forge the future of all of griffonkind. If Redwing does not wish to be part of that future, then may Maar take him!'"

This wasn't expected to be a problem, but Stern was unfortunately surprised when one of the griffons who did show up brought attention to Gawdyna's absence.\n\n The griffon, a particularly young one who had inherited her company from her father, spoke her doubts. 'I don't think we should make any decision without the presence of Gawdyna.' Glancing at Stern, she hastily elaborated on her remark. 'It just wouldn't be right to try to create a unified Talon Company when such an important griffon is missing, right?'\n\n This was met by nods from several other of the assembled griffons, but a moment later another griffon would speak out in protest.\n\n 'You are young and foolish, still idolizing famous griffons as if they were your own ancestors. Gawdyna, despite her accomplishments and renown, is a damned chick when it comes to our future! She would sooner work with ponies than with her own kind!' The elderly griffon paused to catch his breath, before continuing. 'If we were here discussing the future of ponykind, of Equestria, then yes. I would tell you to invite Gawdyna. That's not what we're here discussing though. We are discussing the future of griffonkind! Of creating our own griffonia! And so I say that I don't give a bloatsprite's ass about what Gawdyna thinks!'\n\n This was rapidly met with agreements from the majority of assembled griffons, including Stern herself."

All griffons were told of the Talon Company of old when they were chicks, but the tales regarding this company had splintered just as much as the company itself over the centuries. Some claimed that it was always a collection of independent companies, while others put forward the idea that it was directly created by mandate of the Emperor of Griffonia, who also directly oversaw it. One griffon even went so far as to suggest that Talon Company was the founding entity of the ancient Griffonian Empire, and had been responsible for crafting the legendary Idol of Boreas.\n\n These claims were all put to a rest by Stern herself, who ordered that evidence be brought out to show everygriff the true history of Talon Company. This evidence came in the form of a variety of news clippings that were found in an old office building within the outskirts of Fillydelphia.\n\n They presented heroic images of griffons fighting in the jungles of Zebrica, with the emblem of the Talon Company visible on their guns. The articles headline elaborated what was going on: 'LAST MINUTE DEAL LEADS TO TALON ARMS COMPANY TURNING THE TIDES OF BATTLE'.\n\n From this, a great deal of confusion arose from many of the griffons present.

If there was anything this upstart truly cared about, it was his flock of slaves. The Master halted the executions, approaching the unicorn with a devilish grin. Protege himself stood tall, but there was clearly fear in his eyes. A well justified fear.\n\n \"Come, slave. Back to your rightful master,\" Shackles spoke with sickening glee, reaching for a collar and a leash. Protege did not protest. He did not fight against the collar, slumping down once it finally settled around his neck. In The Master's eyes, he looked much better like this: defeated... hopeless... an epitome of a true slave.\n\n Shackles hit the ex-slaver right in the snout with a powerful blow, sending him collapsing onto the ground with a satisfactory thunk.\n\n §R\"Get up, slave!\"§! The powerful voice of the slaver boomed out, forcing all ponies to huddle and cower before him. §R\"You are mine, upstart. Always have been... and always will be,\"§! the massive stallion said with a delighted grin. Protege looked up into Shackles eyes. The act of defiance was quickly met with another strike. §R\"You do not deserve to look in my eyes, slave. Now get up. We have a walk to do,\"§! said The Master with a grin.\n\n Within a few days, all slaves from the mall would have been herded and put under Shackles' personal control. Sent to the tunnels below Fillydelphia, they would continue his search for the secrets of the metro. Protege was led across the biggest streets of Fillydelphia, for all slavers and slaves alike to see. Ridiculed and called out, the ex-slaver quickly lost all of his will to fight.\n\n Shackles saw this, and with a grin, he looked down at his personal plaything. \"Do you see what you are to them, upstart? Nothing. A mere slave who thought he could escape the eternal chain.\" The two carried on, the black unicorn constantly dragged and belittled, and soon enough they both disappeared inside Shackles' own quarters."

redeye_stablize.1.desc:0 "Work.\n\n The slaves were expected to work until they drop in Fillydelphia. They saw the slavers herd them like cattle, to be sold and to be pressed into labour. They must have wondered how the slavers were capable of committing such cruelties to them when they shared more in common than there were differences that divide them. But this is a city that holds no love, not for those like them.\n\n The sounds of laughter and life was muted and colourless for the slaves of the city as their work was used, exploited, and enjoyed by those who did not consider their lives as anything more than transferable assets. They have always watched, yet never acted. Not before.\n\n The guards lined the city streets in sparse numbers, their weapons held out against the crowds, either as a warning or as a reminder of the slaughter that will come as the inevitable result of insolence. The guards would not be enough to stop them all. Not when those who toil outnumber their tormentors five to one.\n\n The city must live. The city must survive it, come what may. If they came for the heads of their oppressors, then they would have nothing left to lose but their chains. More guards will show them our might and presence could not be challenged, but if we were to give them Bread and Circuses, perhaps they may forget that they were ever slaves at all..."

redeye_stablize.2.desc:0 "Hope.\n\n The fiery voice of a slave echoed through the shuttered room as a small group watched a small earth pony address them. The pony had a deliberate affect to her appearance to look bigger, more impressive. Like a dog raising their hackles or a cat arching their back.\n\n 'Some of you know me!' The pony called out, the eerie silence of the room accented the words, and gave an eerie, strangely loud echo to the pony's voice. 'I know, I’m not what you expected. I'm not much to look at. I don't bulge with muscle. I don't shoot laser beams out of my horn. I know what it's like to be the lowest of the low. After all, to many I'm just another pony in chains.'\n\n 'But I grew up here. I know that there is a better way to structure our society than to cast our fellow creatures into slavery. What hope does a mere earth pony have against something so great and terrible? Not much, but I will fight for what is right. This place, here and now, is the first. We're kindred in suffering. We share a common bond of struggle. I won't blackmail or extort you. If I want to merely be another power-hungry fool,' The pony said, he stomped his hoofs on the ground, 'I would want this city kept as it is, with such waste and destruction only damning it to be another footnote in history.'\n\n 'That's not what I want. I want a better Fillydelphia. Join me. To the slavers, we are all just another resource to be exploited or an insolent child in need of discipline. Together, we can prove that a Union could stand strong against any threat. An attack against one of us is an attack against all of us!' The pony roared, to the sound of repeated hoof-stomps from the gathered group. Some have raised their smuggled weaponry high in the air. 'Friendship is magic. Maybe you know the phrase, maybe you don't. But it was an old phrase that still rings true. The descendants of this great nation have failed you, but we won't. Because now we have hope. We will rise together, as friends, hoof-in-hoof.'"

redeye_stablize.3.title:0 "Griffon Mail"
redeye_stablize.3.desc:0 "Mail.\n\n It had been so long since there was a functional postal service in the Equestrian Wasteland. What little remained of the old telecommunication systems had been so corroded by the passage of time that they serve as nothing more than a perennial reminder of what once was. Few dared to work as messengers and mail-mares when traversing even a short way out of a settlement could result in a grisly fate at the hooves of raiders and become mere collateral damage for the petty struggles of the remaining powers.\n\n Now, this will change. The territorial hegemony under Red Eye had solidified to a point where it is once again possible to deliver traditional paper messages, at least. The Talon Mercs were receptive to the idea of a Griffon Messenger Corp. Much of the work put into rebuilding some semblance of order was a boon to their legitimacy. The news spread across Red Eye’s realm as the anticipation for some shred of normalcy to return was almost too painful to endure.\n\n A curious document made its way to the desk of Red Eye on one fateful day. The final preparations were put in place; the only thing left to decide was who shall be given the responsibility of overseeing the postal service's functionalities as it grows.\n\n A ghoul slave claimed he was once the Postmaster General of Equestria before the War. He called himself Parcel Stamp and wished only to offer his services in rebuilding the new postal system to reach the heights of pre-war efficiency.\n\n The ghoul remains untested and a mere slave in the grand scheme of things, his words of past glories were that of centuries past. Any pony who could corroborate his words and verify the claims he made had all long since died. Stern, on the other hoof, was his second-in-command and would certainly be up to whatever task she was assigned.\n\n With those factors in mind, a decision was made to give the newly-created position to..."

It burns with all its glory; the heat will never last but for that one moment it would leave a mark behind for all to see. The warmth it radiates as it snarls and bites makes it feel alive... a natural process of reaction that captures the vividness of life. Everything could be gone in minutes, due to a single nip.\n\n Perhaps that was why the slaves had chosen fire as the method to express their rage, the pent-up voices of the unheard. An arsonist lit a flame, and now an unquenchable inferno lept and flew, willing to land where it may. To reduce Fillydelphia to cinders in its inextinguishable passion.\n\n We could not save all of it. We are already stretched too thin disabusing those insolent fools of the notion that there could be any hope or beauty down this damnable path of insurrection. How could we stem the bleeding? Now, while there is no thin veil of dignity we could preserve for ourselves, there is still a chance to save one of the affected buildings. In the end, we saved the..."

What is there to see but chaos and fear in those gangs with muddled loyalties? Cliquishness is an intolerable trait to see within our own army, not when it brings their need for absolute obedience into question.\n\n Those beloved soldiers have failed in their obligation to us. Not only that, they failed in remembering what made them whole. Today, our realm is under threat. The slave 'unions' rally against us, even despite our recent victories and shows of force. Corrupt officers promoted from the ranks of those raider gangs gamble away our coin, emptying their own pockets at our expense. Even now, our systems of internal discipline have failed us. It is clear something must be done.\n\n We could slaughter those who were dim-witted enough to associate with a gang to show the ones on the fence what it means to be a part of us. There are no mixed loyalties and no half-promises. We require total commitment. Is death not a reasonable price to exact for their insolence?\n\n But perhaps a harsh ultimatum would be more suited to our approach, to put the fear of death in the dim and insolent requires only a calculated hoof and the right incentives. Fulfil the deepest desires of those who behave and their greed shall drive to be better.\n\n Now, we have decided to..."

Save for that last part, which is most certainly not what we want to happen within our city. Thankfully, it seems that the crisis which has been plaguing us is finally coming to an end. Red Eye himself is overseeing the efforts to restore order within the city.

The bullet lodged itself into Red Eye's skull, killing him well before any medical attention could be provided. As if his death weren't enough of a disaster, this quickly lead to a widespread uprising across all of Fillydelphia.\n\n Fortunately, Stern was quick to act. Her Talons were deployed all across the city, and the slavers were quickly rallied to the city's defence. The fighting lasted the better part of a day, but the slave uprising was relatively quick to lose momentum. By nightfall, most of the slaves had already been herded back into their enclosures. Though some slaves still continue to resist us, they will be swiftly dealt with, and Fillydelphia will be calm once more."

Of course, the wasteland is rarely that kind, and Gearbox was swept up in Red Eye's brutal conquest of the Hinterlands. Gearbox's father was a one of the foremost collaborators during the campaign, betraying his friends and fellow Flatlanders in exchange for a place in Red Eye's new order, alongside the guarantee that his family would remain free. As such, Gearbox found herself thrust into the highest echelons of Boomtown, a role that she detested greatly. To distract herself, she began to listen to the radio, and was instantly captivated by Red Eye's charismatic promises to build a better future, one where all ponies worked together in a great unity, and accepted the necessary evils that came alongside it. Taken by the lofty ideals, Gearbox set out to aid the cause in anyway she could, which eventually landed her a place in Red Eye's Army, leading ponies to a better future.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Genri"

Scattered across his flanks are scars, evidence of the cutie marks he obliterated, the icons that once laid there long forgotten by all but himself. Red Eye's right eye is where he got his name, cybernetic enhancements from his life in Stable 101, where earth ponies continued the advances of science and technology, for personal gain. This didn't sit well with Red Eye, who slaughtered those who disagreed with his twisted idea of mutual responsibility, and mutual rewards for mutual work, and off he went. The barding of his stable around his neck as a reminder of what happens when anyone puts themselves above all others.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
