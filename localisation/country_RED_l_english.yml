In exchange for their annexation they would be spared death but numbers of Foaltopia’s population would be raised into slavery as well as become future slavers.

Now, as RedEye looks upon the thousands of half-dead trees that is the Everfree, he knows that he needs more room to house more ponies in his cathedral, and that finally doing away with the bane that is the Everfree is the only solution. Eventually he gathered ponies that would set Fire Spells that would torch the trees of the Everfree and the beasts that roam within it would perish. Within moments the entire Forest was aflame, and it was quite a spectacle that many across the wasteland could see."

More and more of the former Everfree was converted to shantytowns for the populace both slaver and slave, and more Industrial workshops were being propped up, and there’s still a lot more room to expand. It was all good for RedEye, all at the expense of some troublesome Forest."
