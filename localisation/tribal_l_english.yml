############################### events ###########################
tribal.1.t:0 "A distant memory"
####### Very first focus. Some backstory about how world was destroyed and how little group come toghether to survive, but cuz of lack of resourses they slowly turned into a primitive tribal socity and only thing exist today from their past - their race.
tribal.1.d:0 "Long before the great war Equestria was home to many kinds of species. Ponies,Griffons and the occasional Zebra even took residence. Although all races lived together in harmony, fate would drive them apart.  Our ancestors, our founders, who were they?"
tribal.1.a:0 "Ponies"
tribal.1.b:0 "Zebras"
tribal.1.c:0 "Griffons"
##### Second focus about method how tribe is survivng today, for pony race
tribal.2.t:0 "Who are we?"
tribal.2.d:0 "Our ancestors are the original owners of this land. When Equestria burned from the balefire flame and our pegasi brethren fled to the clouds we thought the end had come. Yet, like the phoenix, we rose from the ashes.\n\nInitially we tried to rebuild but as time went on we realised that we are not who we once were. With no one to help us we were barely able to survive. Few resources could be found and fertile farmland was now an old memory.\n\nIt was a losing battle, eventually we became nothing more than primitives, tribals. Hope is not lost however, we ponies have endured the war and now we believe we can endure the wasteland. Now we just have to decide our path, the calm life of farming? Well known and influential traders? Or maybe scavengers looking for something to bring us closer to the old world?"
tribal.2.a:0 "Farmers"
tribal.2.b:0 "Traders"
tribal.2.c:0 "Scavengers"
##### Second focus about method how tribe is survivng today, for zebra race
tribal.21.t:0 "Who are we?"
tribal.21.d:0 "Our ancestors were the oppressed zebras of Equestria. Old stories say that before the war we lived alongside ponies in harmonary. Then the ponies turned on us, they took their fury out on us. No doubt the Mare in the moon was involved.\n\nWhen the war ended in fire the few of us laughed at the fall of our oppressors. Yet our joy was short lived as we found our own homeland was scarred with megaspells that still rage to this day.\n\nDespair took hold early and it wasn’t long before we fell to our more primitive state. Our tribe was no different from the rest. Already some of us have resorted to enslaving anyone they can get, followed by warriors who cut down any who stand in our way. Shamans whisper of another way, an older way. Will we embrace it?"
tribal.21.a:0 "We were warriors before and we still are"
tribal.21.b:0 "We will show ponies how it feels to be a slaves"
tribal.21.c:0 "We will follow our wise shamans"
##### Second focus about method how tribe is survivng today, for griffon race
tribal.22.t:0 "Who are we?"
tribal.22.d:0 "Our ancestors were the griffons who settled Equestria before Great War wiped out the entire world. It was a new land that griffons were welcomed into. Most of us wanted to escape the rivaling  and sometimes warring houses of Griffonia. Most of these griffons offered much in their trading skills and even old warriors could find a peaceful life hear.\n\nSoon however, war came to Equestria. As the first battle raged many griffons flocked from Griffonia to fight in what they thought were easy prey. Eventually the war drew to a close in a rain balefire bombs.\n\nSome griffons managed to survive, some were traders who avoided the war and now tried to put piece together their peaceful lives. Old mercenaries passed their knowledge and tradition down to their young who hoped to claim glory and fame in the wasteland. There was also the ambitious, those who sought to make a profit of the backs of slaves."
tribal.22.a:0 "We became mercenaries to survive"
tribal.22.b:0 "Regular trading is something kept us alive"
tribal.22.c:0 "Slave trading gives a big profit for us"
##### third focus about how tribe is prospering nowadays and what it's people is dreaming of
tribal.3.t:0 "Mare dreams"
tribal.3.d:0 "You can’t survive alone, not in the wasteland. A group cannot survive without food. A farming coalition will secure our survival. Fertile farmland is almost impossible to find, if you do find it though and build a farm, well, that will draw survivors to us. These survivors have the choice of becoming farm hoofs or guards.\n\nOnly now, we must decide on our ambition. Do we build a cozy village and live a peaceful life? How about rising to the challenge and becoming a beacon of the new world? Rumors however may suggest that we were chosen by the sisters to feed the entire wasteland."
tribal.3.a:0 "We will build a small, cozy village"
tribal.3.b:0 "We are a beacon of new civilization"
tribal.3.c:0 "We will save Wasteland from the starvation"
##### third focus about how tribe is prospering nowadays and what it's people is dreaming of 
tribal.31.t:0 "Flim and Flamg legacy"
tribal.31.d:0 "The key to surviving the wasteland is to have what everyone wants. Starving folk want food from farmers, farmers want tools to raise crops, raiders want to rob farmers. Thus the the farmers become the starving folk and the cycle continues. We may even try and sell rarer more advanced materials but for now we must decide what kind of merchants we will be.\n\nDo we become rich yet honest merchants? Or maybe we could leave the honesty out and focus on profit? There is still the path of becoming just as- no, more powerful than Flim and Flam ever were." #### (pony traders)
tribal.31.a:0 "To be rich and honest"
tribal.31.b:0 "To have a lot of money"
tribal.31.c:0 "To became powerful as Flim and Flam did"
##### third focus about how tribe is prospering nowadays and what it's people is dreaming of 
tribal.32.t:0 "Old World Blues"
tribal.32.d:0 "Even now, Equestria will take care of us. The old world still has many tools and secrets to give to us. Old robots, scrap, books and much more. All of these could be traded for caps or it could be hoarded, even used on occasions.\n\nWe must decide on what kind of scavengers we are. Do we scrounge enough to sell for bread and butter? Maybe we could go after the few things still worth taking? Our past may have to be protected however, we could preserve what is left and keep it away from raiders. " ##### (pony scavengers)
tribal.32.a:0 "We just need caps on bread and butter"
tribal.32.b:0 "Ruins of the past are still full of richies"
tribal.32.c:0 "We must save our history from raiders"
##### third focus about how tribe is prospering nowadays and what it's people is dreaming of 
tribal.321.t:0 "Former glory"
tribal.321.d:0 "Fire, that’s what the world was cleansed with. Now it is nothing more than a giant arena for our warriors to test themselves in. Even now, those who come of age journey out into the wasteland. Those that return often bare scars of their first kill showing they’re worthy of being in our tribe.\n\nSome of us have questioned what kind of warriors we should be. Our warriors prove themselves early, surely they would be able to conquer the wasteland. Yet, a wise warrior will know when they’re outmatched, we will keep to ourselves and defend ourselves against any aggressor.\n\nBut many of our warriors remember glory of the past from the stories and legends about our former homeland - Zebrica and about it's legendary invictible Legion. Maybe we should search for remnants of it in wasteland and restore our honor by rejoining it...Or we can create our own new Legion so everyone can see our might and glory." ##### (zebra warriors)
tribal.321.a:0 "We will conquer the Wasteland"
tribal.321.b:0 "We just want to live on our own"
tribal.321.c:0 "We must restore the former glory of Caesar and join the Legion"
tribal.321.e:0 "We will create our own army as powerful as Legion is"
##### third focus about how tribe is prospering nowadays and what it's people is dreaming of 
tribal.322.t:0 "The most valuable commodity"
tribal.322.d:0 "They insulted us, hurt us and killed us. Now it’s our turn to rule over the ponies. With a focus on capturing as many slaves as possible we could fill our camps with these welps. Sometimes a few of our slavers will take vengeance against ponies for what they did to us in the war, yet it’s something we can afford to allow.\n\nThe only question that remains is what we do with our slaves. Use them as cheap labour and pathetic soldiers? Claim the best for ourselves and do off with the rest? Or maybe we can forge a true slave empire and conquer whole regions. " ##### (zebra slavers)
tribal.322.a:0 "The cheapest ponypower in wasteland is all we need"
tribal.322.b:0 "We will keep finest slaves for ourselves and sell the rest"
tribal.322.c:0 "We must build a new empire, empire of slavers"
##### third focus about how tribe is prospering nowadays and what it's people is dreaming of 
tribal.323.t:0 "Secrets of the other side"
tribal.323.d:0 "Death will conquer life. As it was said long ago before the bombs fell. Death came to equestria and won. We must learn the secrets of death, our shamans claim to know it’s secrets. We obey their will and in return, they will grant us power.\n\nOur shamans tell us of many paths to the future, which one will we take? The path of lords… drug lords, we will sell the most wanted drugs in the wasteland. Or, we can save the lives of so many with our knowledge. Or we can choose to continue down our path of necromancy." ##### (zebra shamans)
tribal.323.a:0 "We can become lords...drug lords"
tribal.323.b:0 "We can save so many lives with our knowledge"
tribal.323.c:0 "Nothing can stop us from discovering secrets of life"
##### third focus about how tribe is prospering nowadays and what it's people is dreaming of 
tribal.331.t:0 "Warriors Of Griffonstone"
tribal.331.d:0 "Griffons are unmatched in war, even in the war between zebras and ponies both sides sought to buy out whole mercenary companies full of Griffons just to gain an edge. To this day, even after the war, everyone with more than hoof, claw or appendage full of caps will go looking for griffons to fight their petty wars. This leaves us both rich and with plenty of experience. What our contractors should look for: more wealthy patrons to gain more profit per target, more mercs for more simultaneous missions, or experienced professionals for the hardest of contracts?" #### (griffon mercs)
tribal.331.a:0 "We need to find a rich patron" #Expensive contracts
tribal.331.b:0 "We need more beaks" #Big gang
tribal.331.c:0 "We need more ronins who'd earned a name for themselfs" # Wise soldiers 
##### third focus about how tribe is prospering nowadays and what it's people is dreaming of 
tribal.332.t:0 "Crescit amor nummi, quantum ipsa pecunia crescit" #BIRBS MERCHANTS
tribal.332.d:0 "Griffons are known for their trading experience, as they can oftenly make loads of profit from something. What kind of rule our traders should follow: be honorable as our predcessors were and make money on fair conditions, make money by any means (even if it includes lies and murders) and gain maximal wealth, or just sell those who have no money to pay with so there would be only rich?" ####(griffon traders)
tribal.332.a:0 "Became rich and honest"
tribal.332.b:0 "Earn as much money as possible"
tribal.332.c:0 "Surpass our pre-war bourgeoisie ancestors "
##### third focus about how tribe is prospering nowadays and what it's people is dreaming of 
tribal.333.t:0 "Non olet" #BIRB SLAVERS
tribal.333.d:0 "In a land so depopulated and inhospitable one of the most wanted things is slaves. Griffons have almost every physical advantage over a pony which allows us to overpower and enslave as many settlements as we desire. We could sell these slaves to many buyers to net ourselves a great profit or use them for our own desires. Should we gather hunting groups to get more slaves for trade, increase the quality of what bodies we sell to gain more profit, or capture some wasteland territory to scare off others who try to follow our steps?" #### (griffon slavers)
tribal.333.a:0 "We need more slaves to sell" # More slaves
tribal.333.b:0 "We need to sell better-quality 'goods' " # Earn more money
tribal.333.c:0 "We should regain control on Wasteland." # More power
