 commonwealth_start.1.d:0 "At the conclusion of the Sparkle-Wars, the Warbands of the §OPrincedom of Kucyków§! and the Cohorts of the §rGrand Limuan Principality§! were arrayed once more for yet another battle in their decades-long Conflict.\nBut on this day, the 9th of August 1160, their war would finally come to an end. As both sides marched to claim the relatively unimportant §Cvillage of Smoerbott§!, the adviser of the outnumbered Limuan side advised his leader to avoid direct conflict, and instead defeat the Kucykówans with other means. The Prince took the advice, and decided to challenge his opponent to §CSingle-combat§!, to decide which side would own Smoerbott. As they fought, both inflicted wounds upon eachother, until the prince of Kucyków was slain, though the Limuan one only survived for 30 second longer, before dropping from his wounds.\nOutraged, a minor scuffle between the nobles of both sides excalated, until shots were fired, and chaos descended upon them.\n\nWhen the smoke dissipated, §Cthe Royal families of both sides lay slain in the grass§!, all the major members of their houses slain.\nThe remaining advisors and officers from both sides decided then and there, that this war had gone on for far too long, and neither of their nations would survive it. They picked a 3 year-old distant Niece of the Prince of Kucyków, who was also a 4th cousin to the Prince of Limua's wife, to start a new Dynasty, and finally unify the two Realms in peace.\n\nThis was formalized two weeks later in a written Document, known as the §RTreaty of Smoerbott§!\nHowever, the treaty was still a bit biased, and the city it favoured was..."

 commonwealth_start.2.d:0 "Many of our brightest minds agree:\nThe decline of the Commonwealth started 11 years ago, with the so called §RGreat Northern Expedition§!.\n\nOur armies had just subjugated Stratusburg 4 years prior, when King Purefire declared his ambition to expand our borders north of the Polga River. With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that this was mainly due to the late King's own feelings of inadequacy, and pressure from the Cossacks. At the time, most did not see the problem with such an expansion, after all: The Commonwealth had the greatest army in the Region!\n\nTwo great Hosts marched northward, 12000 Ponies between the two of them. It was a sight to behold, truly.\nThe first months went smoothly, with closeby settlements being swiftly subjugated, and little local resistance being encountered. Soon thereafter, the Unseed Council and the E.D.F. in the West stopped their hostilities and joined together against us, while our troops were becomming progressively more and more bogged down due to local tribals setting traps and ambushes.\n\nFor two more years Purefire tried to turn the campaign around, but Tribal resistance, New Coalitions in the North, and the harsh Severnayan Winter eventually brought our armies to their knees, and Purefire was forced to withdraw in shame.\nThe King was devastated in the loss, and many say he lost his spirit for rulership the day he had to cross the Polga on the way home. Soon thereafter he elevated his wife Falling Dusk to be Co-Monarch, as he found the burden of Leadership to be too heavy for him alone.\n\nThe Commonw Creatures of the Commonwealth were disapponted as well, with many loosing faith in the Monarchy, and some even beginning to doubt the Commonwealth itself, as they thought it had lost its..."

 commonwealth_start.3.d:0 "In 1230, a young Yak-Warlord by the name of §RGrimsmasher§! blazed a trail of destruction first through Novochernusk, and then thorugh our own Western lands. He lead a massive host of fearsome Yak Warriors, many of which would need multiple magazines of ammunition, or even anti-machine weapons before they finally went down.\n\nOur Army, still battered from the Great Northern Expedition, was slow to mobilize, and before the first formations had assembled, Grimsmasher had already pushed to our southern lands and occupied the Province of Willowtown.\nKing Purefire and Queen Falling Dusk decide to lead different hosts, in order to cut of the Yaks retreat, and smash the in the field, but Grimshasher manages to evade a direct engagement for months, showing a very un-Yaklike talent for strategy and logistics.\nIn late 1231, the armies finnaly catch up to the Yaks, and engage in a massive field-battle. Unbeknowst to them, Grimshasher had been making diplomatic Overtures to soem of the more disloyal territories, and the Troops from Arria leave the battlefield prematurely, while the Contingent from Direfall turns on their comrades and joins the Yaks' side.\n\nThusly betrayed, the Hosts of the Commonwealth are dealt a crippling blow, with Queen Falling Dusk being killed in combat by Grimsmasher himself, though she managed to inflict some major injuries on the Warlord with her magic.\n\nThe Armies of the Commonwealth retreated north, pursued by a large detachement of Yaks led by Grimsmashers second in command. Just south of Kucyków, General Stalwart Shield manages to rally the army, and lures the pursuing yaks into range of Cities fortifications, killing a great many of them, including Grimsmashers second-in-command. The next day the King is found to have been poisoned by an Assasin from Arria, who have now fully seceded.

And yet it was just so, her Agents had managed to intercept several letters and spy on important meeting between Vermillion and his closest Supporters.\nAll his political posturing had finally grown into something mcuh more terrible. His proposals would mean the end for the nobility as Stalwart knew it, and upend the entire social order of the Commonwealth.\n\nHow could he even think of this? They were at the brink of another war with the Yaks, and Vermillion sought to weaken them further? Did he not see that he was leading them all onto a path of destruction... that Sister would slay Brother and their armies would grind eachother down, till Grimsmasher would only have to come in and pick up the broken pieces of their great Nation.\n\nNo!\nStalwart would not let that happen!

When pressed on the nature of these 'Experiments' the Council refused to answer, citing prior legislation giving them a right to secrecy, unless overruled by a royal decree.\n\nAs soon as the Council had spoken their last word, the Chamber erupted in debate, with the many members as always more interested in what would be more profitable, than what would do the nation any good.\nStalwart let it go on for a few minutes, before standing up and coughing audibly.

Ostensibly, this was for a potential invasion from Severnaya, or maybe even to defend Rayoreyda, should the traitors from Arria decide to try their luck at an invasion, but Stalwart knew better.\nShe wasn't sure how, but Burning Steppe must have gotten wind of Vermillions treacherous plans, and is now making moves to seize control of the nation herself, once the Chaos starts.\n\nStalwart knew that she couldn't fully deny Steppe, as that would cause many cossacks within her own army to leave at such an insult, but could she truly hand such forces to a potential enemy?\n\nOf course, if she did grant the rights, she could mandate the troops be send to Kucyków for training, which would make it quite the easy task to sow dissent in the ranks of the Cossacks...\nAccepting with subterfuge, or limiting the proposal as much as she dared, she would have to make a decision now, while she still had the advantage of momentum.

Nopony was seriously hurt, though by the wording of the complaints, one could almost think somebody was murdered on stage.\n\nApparently, the Vermillionist, a rich Merhcant by the name of 'Golden Deal', had started his speech with the usual rhetoric about the necessity of a government-controlled redistribution of wealth, an expansion of the Grain-dole and new limits on the powers of the Nobility.\nHe was then interrupted by a heckler from the 4-Cities Party.\n\nGolden Deal then proceeded to go off-text and began questioning the continued existance of the 4-Cities Party, exclaiming that with the loss of Arria the Commonwealth only has 3 great Cities, and then accused the 4-CP of Cooperating with the Traitors from Arria.\n\nFrankly, all the complaints were quite childish, most members of the Assembly had high places in society, and really should know better.\nStalwart Shield stamped all the complaints with 'Rejected!' and turned to deal with more important matters."

According to their letter, they are willing to take full responsibility of ensuring the prisoners don't escape and they they are 'punished accordingly to their crimes'. They are not willing to guarrantee the survival of those not on Death-row however, as their experiments supposedly have a very high mortality rate, this being the reason they are requesting Prisoners to begin with.\n\nThis could certainly be of use, as many of our prisons are near maximum capacity, and are costing us money that we, frankly, dont have at the moment.\nTo prevent public outrage, we could simply send them those prisoners that would not be missed, Raiders, Deserters and those without families for example.\n\nLimua won't be happy to be denied, and the Council is sure to use their influence to retaliate politically."

She couldn't let anyone she didn't trust fully have this information.\n\nIf this became known to the public, the Vermillionists would finally have their proof of the governments incompetency, the merchants would want her gone as Regent, and her noble enemies would jump at the opportunity to replace her.\n\nNo, she couldn't have that.\nThe government would simply continue to operate as if they weren't bankrupt. They could surely do some 'creative accounting'of their own.\nStalwart was unsure for how long they could keep up the scharade, but she was determined to stabilize the country before bankruptcy eroded the last bits of confidence the Citizenry had."

Not long after, many of the cities factories came to a halt, as an impromptu strike spread across the city.\n\nTo the shock of the City-guard, when they tried to disperse the crowd and arrest Vermillion, some of the Guard-officers recognized members of the Army among the protestors, apparently having joined Vermillion.\n\nAfraid of turning the protest into a bloodbath on both sides, the Commander of the guard decided to simply contain the protest until the guard could link up with Stalwart Shield's personal Guard.\nStalwart was out herself, inspecting her troops before sending them in, when an urgent missive reached her:\nSigned by multiple of the high Nobles, the missive called on her to ignore the protest, and instead focus on evacuating the most loyal elements of the City-Guard, as well as the personal retinues of the High-Nobles and to send them north, to her Estate.\nThat would certainly give her a large power-base to fall back on, once the Coup happened, but could she really let the Riots continue?"
