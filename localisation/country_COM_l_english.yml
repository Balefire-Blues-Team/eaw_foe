As both sides marched to claim the relatively unimportant §Gvillage of Smoerbott§!, the adviser of the outnumbered Limuan side advised his leader to avoid direct conflict, and instead defeat the Kucykówans with other means. The Prince took the advice, and decided to challenge his opponent to §GSingle-combat§!, to decide which side would own Smoerbott. As they fought, both inflicted wounds upon eachother, until the prince of Kucyków was slain, though the Limuan one only survived for 30 second longer, before dropping from his wounds.\nOutraged, a minor scuffle between the nobles of both sides excalated, until shots were fired, and chaos descended upon them.\n\nWhen the smoke dissipated, §Gthe Royal families of both sides lay slain in the grass§!, all the major members of their houses slain.\nThe remaining advisors and officers from both sides decided then and there, that this war had gone on for far too long, and neither of their nations would survive it. They picked a 3 year-old distant Niece of the Prince of Kucyków, who was also a 4th cousin to the Prince of Limua's wife, to start a new Dynasty, and finally unify the two Realms in peace.\n\nThis was formalized two weeks later in a written Document, known as the §RTreaty of Smoerbott§!\nHowever, the treaty was still a bit biased, and the city it favoured was..."

 commonwealth_start.2.d:0 "Many of our brightest minds agree:\nThe decline of the Commonwealth started 11 years ago, with the so called §RGreat Northern Expedition§!.\n\nOur armies had just subjugated Stratusburg 4 years prior, when King Purefire declared his ambition to expand our borders north of the Polga River. With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that this was mainly due to the late King's own feelings of inadequacy, and pressure from the Cossacks. At the time, most did not see the problem with such an expansion, after all: The Commonwealth had the greatest army in the Region!\n\nTwo great Hosts marched northward, 12000 Ponies between the two of them. It was a sight to behold, truly.\nThe first months went smoothly, with closeby settlements being swiftly subjugated, and little local resistance being encountered. Soon thereafter, the Unseed Council and the E.D.F. in the West stopped their hostilities and joined together against us, while our troops were becomming progressively more and more bogged down due to local tribals setting traps and ambushes.\n\nFor two more years Purefire tried to turn the campaign around, but Tribal resistance, New Coalitions in the North, and the harsh Severnayan Winter eventually brought our armies to their knees, and Purefire was forced to withdraw in shame.\nThe King was devastated in the loss, and many say he lost his spirit for rulership the day he had to cross the Polga on the way home. Soon thereafter he elevated his wife Falling Dusk to be Co-Monarch, as he found the burden of Leadership to be too heavy for him alone.\n\nThe Commonw Creatures of the Commonwealth were disapponted as well, with many loosing faith in the Monarchy, and some even beginning to doubt the Commonwealth itself, as they thought it had lost its..."

He lead a massive host of fearsome Yak Warriors, many of which would need multiple magazines of ammunition, or even anti-machine weapons before they finally went down.\n\nOur Army, still battered from the Great Northern Expedition, was slow to mobilize, and before the first formations had assembled, Grimsmasher had already pushed to our southern lands and occupied the Province of Willowtown.\nKing Purefire and Queen Falling Dusk decide to lead different hosts, in order to cut of the Yaks retreat, and smash the in the field, but Grimshasher manages to evade a direct engagement for months, showing a very un-Yaklike talent for strategy and logistics.\nIn late 1231, the armies finnaly catch up to the Yaks, and engage in a massive field-battle. Unbeknowst to them, Grimshasher had been making diplomatic Overtures to soem of the more disloyal territories, and the Troops from Arria leave the battlefield prematurely, while the Contingent from Direfall turns on their comrades and joins the Yaks' side.\n\nThusly betrayed, the Hosts of the Commonwealth are dealt a crippling blow, with Queen Falling Dusk being killed in combat by Grimsmasher himself, though she managed to inflict some major injuries on the Warlord with her magic.\n\nThe Armies of the Commonwealth retreated north, pursued by a large detachement of Yaks led by Grimsmashers second in command. Just south of Kucyków, General Stalwart Shield manages to rally the army, and lures the pursuing yaks into range of Cities fortifications, killing a great many of them, including Grimsmashers second-in-command.

And yet it was just so, her Agents had managed to intercept several letters and spy on important meeting between Vermillion and his closest Supporters.\nAll his political posturing had finally grown into something mcuh more terrible. His proposals would mean the end for the nobility as Stalwart knew it, and upend the entire social order of the Commonwealth.\n\nHow could he even think of this? They were at the brink of another war with the Yaks, and Vermillion sought to weaken them further? Did he not see that he was leading them all onto a path of destruction... that Sister would slay Brother and their armies would grind eachother down, till Grimsmasher would only have to come in and pick up the broken pieces of their great Nation.\n\nNo!\nStalwart would not let that happen!

When pressed on the nature of these 'Experiments' the Council refused to answer, citing prior legislation giving them a right to secrecy, unless overruled by a royal decree.\n\nAs soon as the Council had spoken their last word, the Chamber erupted in debate, with the many members as always more interested in what would be more profitable, than what would do the nation any good.\nStalwart let it go on for a few minutes, before standing up and coughing audibly.

Ostensibly, this was for a potential invasion from Severnaya, or maybe even to defend Rayoreyda, should the traitors from Arria decide to try their luck at an invasion, but Stalwart knew better.\nShe wasn't sure how, but Burning Steppe must have gotten wind of Vermillions treacherous plans, and is now making moves to seize control of the nation herself, once the Chaos starts.\n\nStalwart knew that she couldn't fully deny Steppe, as that would cause many cossacks within her own army to leave at such an insult, but could she truly hand such forces to a potential enemy?\n\nOf course, if she did grant the rights, she could mandate the troops be send to Kucyków for training, which would make it quite the easy task to sow dissent in the ranks of the Cossacks...\nAccepting with subterfuge, or limiting the proposal as much as she dared, she would have to make a decision now, while she still had the advantage of momentum.

 commonwealth_start.7.t:0 "Scuffle in the Assembly"
 commonwealth_start.7.d:0 "No less than 11 complaints were filed by the different factions in the Assembly of Hearts today, after a member of the '4-Cities party' attempted to drag a Vermillionist giving a speech from the Podium, which then escalated into a larger scuffle between the two political factions. Nopony was seriously hurt, though by the wording of the complaints, one could almost think somebody was murdered on stage.\n\nApparently, the Vermillionist, a rich Merhcant by the name of 'Golden Deal', had started his speech with the usual rhetoric about the necessity of a government-controlled redistribution of wealth, an expansion of the Grain-dole and new limits on the powers of the Nobility.\nHe was then interrupted by a heckler from the 4-Cities Party.\n\nGolden Deal then proceeded to go off-text and began questioning the continued existance of the 4-Cities Party, exclaiming that with the loss of Arria the Commonwealth only has 3 great Cities, and then accused the 4-CP of Cooperating with the Traitors from Arria.\n\nFrankly, all the complaints were quite childish, most members of the Assembly had high places in society, and really should know better.\nStalwart Shield stamped all the complaints with 'Rejected!' and turned to deal with more important matters."

 commonwealth_start.8.d:0 "Truly, an unusual request.\n\nIt appears that the High-mages of Limua, the 'Council of Spring', require some live specimen for some unspecified experiments.\nFor this purpose, they have requested that Prisoners from both Kucyków and Smoertbott are sent to them. According to their letter, they are willing to take full responsibility of ensuring the prisoners don't escape and they they are 'punished accordingly to their crimes'. They are not willing to guarrantee the survival of those not on Death-row however, as their experiments supposedly have a very high mortality rate, this being the reason they are requesting Prisoners to begin with.\n\nThis could certainly be of use, as many of our prisons are near maximum capacity, and are costing us money that we, frankly, dont have at the moment.\nTo prevent public outrage, we could simply send them those prisoners that would not be missed, Raiders, Deserters and those without families for example.\n\nLimua won't be happy to be denied, and the Council is sure to use their influence to retaliate politically."

 commonwealth_start.9.d:0 "§REMPTY§!\n\nThose five red letters mocked her from the bottom of the Treasury report.\nStalwart Shield knew their economic situation wasn't great, but a month ago she was still confident that they'd make it at least another 2 years.\nA recent investigation had revealed that many of the previous years numbers had been 'creatively interpreted' by a number of clerks either too corrupt to care, or too afraid to tell her the truth.\n\nThey had been right to be afraid, of course, as Stalwart had already ordered the responsible Ponies to be covertly 'disappeared' by the Royal Guard and her personal Agents. She couldn't let anyone she didn't trust fully have this information.\n\nIf this became known to the public, the Vermillionists would finally have their proof of the governments incompetency, the merchants would want her gone as Regent, and her noble enemies would jump at the opportunity to replace her.\n\nNo, she couldn't have that.\nThe government would simply continue to operate as if they weren't bankrupt. They could surely do some 'creative accounting'of their own.\nStalwart was unsure for how long they could keep up the scharade, but she was determined to stabilize the country before bankruptcy eroded the last bits of confidence the Citizenry had."

 commonwealth_start.10.d:0 "The North Quarter was rudely awoken this morning, when Vermillion Grace and many members of the Vermillionists took to the streets to protest the current actions of the Government.\nThe protest quickly increased in size, as many of the Homeless and disenfranchised were riled up by Vermillion. Not long after, many of the cities factories came to a halt, as an impromptu strike spread across the city.\n\nTo the shock of the City-guard, when they tried to disperse the crowd and arrest Vermillion, some of the Guard-officers recognized members of the Army among the protestors, apparently having joined Vermillion.\n\nAfraid of turning the protest into a bloodbath on both sides, the Commander of the guard decided to simply contain the protest until the guard could link up with Stalwart Shield's personal Guard.\nStalwart was out herself, inspecting her troops before sending them in, when an urgent missive reached her:\nSigned by multiple of the high Nobles, the missive called on her to ignore the protest, and instead focus on evacuating the most loyal elements of the City-Guard, as well as the personal retinues of the High-Nobles and to send them north, to her Estate.\nThat would certainly give her a large power-base to fall back on, once the Coup happened, but could she really let the Riots continue?"

 commonwealth_start.18.d:0 "'We cannot afford to mince words, so I'll be the one to come out and put it bluntly: Our Military in total disarray.'\nGeneral Aegis let it sink in for a moment, the reactions from the other members of the Ministry of Seven ranging from disinterest to grim acceptance. Noone was surprised, it had been an open secret for months now, with all of them dancing around the subject, as none wanted to deal with the Implications.\n'Then isn't it your job to fix it, General?' Lord Vitamant was the first to break the Silence. As so often happened recently, he sought to assign blame instead of bringing something constructive to the table.\n'I think we all know that the Government lacks the funds to raise new formations.'Lady Ingenue spoke up. 'Not to mention that we can't draft more without cutting into our industrial base. The Expedition and the Grimwar have depleted us greatly, and some of our prime recruiting grounds in Stratusburg and Arria have seceded.' She looked to the Governess general, who was in the process of studying the proposal in front of her.\nIt was the reason for their meeting: The Assembly had sought to make the first move, and had not only filed a formal complaint pertaining to the state of the Armed forces, but also supplied a nine-page proposal as to how the situation could be ammended. It had been penned by Crystal Drop, protegé of Vermillion Grace, one of the leading figure in the Vermillionist movement... and Aegis' Daughter.\nAegis had to admit that the proposal was sound, and he was sure that the other members of the Ministry saw it as well. The one problematic thing was the funding. This reformed Army would be mainly funded through an additional tax levied upon the merchants by the Assembly.\nStalwart Shield finally looked up 'I think we can all agree to the basics of the proposal, dubious as any proposal from the Vermillionists may be. We will amend it, of course, to prevent this from outright handing over control to the Assembly, but we won't be able to stifle all of their influence, unless...' She looked at each of the other six in turn, lingering on them for a few seconds each '...unless we all are willing to pool some of our collective wealth to hold over the army for the time being. At least until the Government is back in shape.'\nAegis could virtually taste the mood souring in the room. Asking High nobles to give up some of their wealth would always be a painful process. They would have to vote on this."

 commonwealth_farther.1.d:0 "The Radio broadcast sounded hollow, a distorted echo following each word, as if it had travelled through some winding cave on its way from the tower to their little Field-Radio. Aketon had to concentrate to make out the individual words, which was made a lot harder by the fact that one of those thrice-damned rabels was taking potshots at him and his group every few minutes. They knew the sniper was hiding in the upper floor af a barn, less than a hundred yards from their own position, but none of them had gotten a glimpse of them since the first bullet had caught Cheminage in the leg.\nThe radio sputtered and went silent. From the looks on the faces of the others, the orders had not been ones to raise their spirits.\nWHen the shooting started, they ahd taken shelter in the ruins of a garage, pre-war, since it was built from proper concrete. Cheminage was properly bandaged now, though they had decided not use one of the 3 healing potions they had between the 4 of them, instead saving those for actually life-threatening wounds. Corporal Heriot was trying to get the radio back to work, while Inkhorn had made herself busy counting their remaining ammunition, pitiful though the amount was.\nThey had been in almost continuous engagements since before dawn, at times linking up with other squads, mostly fighting just fighting as a unit of four. As far as Aketon could tell, High command was still in total chaos, and any orders they got were mainly from lower-ranking officers, each trying to get some measure of control of the situation. The rebels, it turned out, were a lot better armed and trained than they had expected, and they had a nasty tendency to fight in civillian clothing, meaning you were never sure if you were shooting at an innocent bystander, or a disguised rebel, just waiting to shoot you in the back.\n\nCRACK\nAnother bullet impacted the wall of the garage, the 19th, if you were counting the one that had hit Cheminage. Last he'd heard, they were outnumbered 3-1 on this southern front, and it would likely not get any better, now that the Kucyków had fallen.\nA soft static reached his ears, as Heriot stepped back, the radio apparently fixed. The static gave way to a voice, half familiar, for it was often heard in these kinds of broadcasts: The Governess-General.\nHe gripped his rifle tighter, as Stalwart Shield began to address those still Loyal to their Nation:"
