 COM_shattered_army:0 "Shattered Army"
 COM_shattered_army_desc:0 "The Great Northern Expedition, as well as the Grimwar and the secession of Arria have severely diminished our military power. Once we had the greatest army in the region, but now many of our officers are dead, and the empty ranks in our battalions are only slowly being filled by green recruits, whom we'll have to train from the ground up."
 
 COM_ripped_heart:0 "Loss of the Industrial Heartland"
 COM_ripped_heart_desc:0 "While Kucyków has long been the largest city in the Commonwealth, it was traditionally Arria, that provided the majority of military equipment. Not only that, with Arria seceding, a lot of prominent industrialists also left the country, in search of a more stable home. It will take years to rebuild our industry, or maybe some radical new ideas..."
 
 COM_rebel_cossacks:0 "Rebellious Cossacks"
 COM_rebel_cossacks_desc:0 "The Cossacks were never the most loyal supporters of the Government, but with the failiure of the Great Northern Expedition, from which many Cossacks expected new land to settle in Severnaya, they are more rebellious than ever. Many refuse the draft, and their representatives in the Assembly and Council are openly antagonizing us."
 
 COM_assembly_of_hearts:0 "Assembly of Hearts"
 COM_assembly_of_hearts_desc:0 "A concession to the commons, the Assembly of Hearts is the only higher form of Government that commoners can be elected to. While it has opposed our politics at some points, it is still a great factor in keeping our nation stable."
