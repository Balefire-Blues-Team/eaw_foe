 COM_shattered_army_desc:0 "The Great Northern Expedition, as well as the Grimwar and the secession of Arria have severely diminished our military power. Once we had the greatest army in the region, but now many of our officers are dead, and the empty ranks in our battalions are only slowly being filled by green recruits, whom we'll have to train from the ground up."

It will take years to rebuild our industry, or maybe some radical new ideas..."

 commonwealth_start.1.d:0 "At the conclusion of the Sparkle-Wars, the Warbands of the §OPrincedom of Kucyków§! and the Cohorts of the §rGrand Limuan Principality§! were arrayed once more for yet another battle in their decades-long Conflict.\nBut on this day, the 9th of August 1160, their war would finally come to an end. As both sides marched to claim the relatively unimportant §Cvillage of Smoerbott§!, the adviser of the outnumbered Limuan side advised his leader to avoid direct conflict, and instead defeat the Kucykówans with other means. The Prince took the advice, and decided to challenge his opponent to §CSingle-combat§!, to decide which side would own Smoerbott. As they fought, both inflicted wounds upon eachother, until the prince of Kucyków was slain, though the Limuan one only survived for 30 second longer, before dropping from his wounds.\nOutraged, a minor scuffle between the nobles of both sides excalated, until shots were fired, and chaos descended upon them.\n\nWhen the smoke dissipated, §Cthe Royal families of both sides lay slain in the grass§!, all the major members of their houses slain.\nThe remaining advisors and officers from both sides decided then and there, that this war had gone on for far too long, and neither of their nations would survive it. They picked a 3 year-old distant Niece of the Prince of Kucyków, who was also a 4th cousin to the Prince of Limua's wife, to start a new Dynasty, and finally unify the two Realms in peace.\n\nThis was formalized two weeks later in a written Document, known as the §RTreaty of Smoerbott§!\nHowever, the treaty was still a bit biased, and the city it favoured was..."

 commonwealth_start.2.t:0 "King Purefire's Folly"
 commonwealth_start.2.d:0 "Many of our brightest minds agree:\nThe decline of the Commonwealth started 11 years ago, with the so called §RGreat Northern Expedition§!.\n\nOur armies had just subjugated Stratusburg 4 years prior, when King Purefire declared his ambition to expand our borders north of the Polga River. With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that this was mainly due to the late King's own feelings of inadequacy, and pressure from the Cossacks. At the time, most did not see the problem with such an expansion, after all: The Commonwealth had the greatest army in the Region!\n\nTwo great Hosts marched northward, 12000 Ponies between the two of them. It was a sight to behold, truly.\nThe first months went smoothly, with closeby settlements being swiftly subjugated, and little local resistance being encountered. Soon thereafter, the Unseed Council and the E.D.F. in the West stopped their hostilities and joined together against us, while our troops were becomming progressively more and more bogged down due to local tribals setting traps and ambushes.\n\nFor two more years Purefire tried to turn the campaign around, but Tribal resistance, New Coalitions in the North, and the harsh Severnayan Winter eventually brought our armies to their knees, and Purefire was forced to withdraw in shame.\nThe King was devastated in the loss, and many say he lost his spirit for rulership the day he had to cross the Polga on the way home. Soon thereafter he elevated his wife Falling Dusk to be Co-Monarch, as he found the burden of Leadership to be too heavy for him alone.\n\nThe Commonw Creatures of the Commonwealth were disapponted as well, with many loosing faith in the Monarchy, and some even beginning to doubt the Commonwealth itself, as they thought it had lost its..."

 commonwealth_start.3.d:0 "In 1230, a young Yak-Warlord by the name of §RGrimsmasher§! blazed a trail of destruction first through Novochernusk, and then thorugh our own Western lands. He lead a massive host of fearsome Yak Warriors, many of which would need multiple magazines of ammunition, or even anti-machine weapons before they finally went down.\n\nOur Army, still battered from the Great Northern Expedition, was slow to mobilize, and before the first formations had assembled, Grimsmasher had already pushed to our southern lands and occupied the Province of Willowtown.\nKing Purefire and Queen Falling Dusk decide to lead different hosts, in order to cut of the Yaks retreat, and smash the in the field, but Grimshasher manages to evade a direct engagement for months, showing a very un-Yaklike talent for strategy and logistics.\nIn late 1231, the armies finnaly catch up to the Yaks, and engage in a massive field-battle. Unbeknowst to them, Grimshasher had been making diplomatic Overtures to soem of the more disloyal territories, and the Troops from Arria leave the battlefield prematurely, while the Contingent from Direfall turns on their comrades and joins the Yaks' side.\n\nThusly betrayed, the Hosts of the Commonwealth are dealt a crippling blow, with Queen Falling Dusk being killed in combat by Grimsmasher himself, though she managed to inflict some major injuries on the Warlord with her magic.\n\nThe Armies of the Commonwealth retreated north, pursued by a large detachement of Yaks led by Grimsmashers second in command. Just south of Kucyków, General Stalwart Shield manages to rally the army, and lures the pursuing yaks into range of Cities fortifications, killing a great many of them, including Grimsmashers second-in-command. The next day the King is found to have been poisoned by an Assasin from Arria, who have now fully seceded. Acting as Regent for the young prince Meltdown, Stalwart Shield takes count of what they had left and finds..."

And yet it was just so, her Agents had managed to intercept several letters and spy on important meeting between Vermillion and his closest Supporters.\nAll his political posturing had finally grown into something mcuh more terrible. His proposals would mean the end for the nobility as Stalwart knew it, and upend the entire social order of the Commonwealth.\n\nHow could he even think of this? They were at the brink of another war with the Yaks, and Vermillion sought to weaken them further? Did he not see that he was leading them all onto a path of destruction... that Sister would slay Brother and their armies would grind eachother down, till Grimsmasher would only have to come in and pick up the broken pieces of their great Nation.\n\nNo!\nStalwart would not let that happen!

When pressed on the nature of these 'Experiments' the Council refused to answer, citing prior legislation giving them a right to secrecy, unless overruled by a royal decree.\n\nAs soon as the Council had spoken their last word, the Chamber erupted in debate, with the many members as always more interested in what would be more profitable, than what would do the nation any good.\nStalwart let it go on for a few minutes, before standing up and coughing audibly. Quickly, the Chamber fell silent.\n'I have made my decision! As Regent of Prince Meltdown, I award the rights to Velika to..."

Ostensibly, this was for a potential invasion from Severnaya, or maybe even to defend Rayoreyda, should the traitors from Arria decide to try their luck at an invasion, but Stalwart knew better.\nShe wasn't sure how, but Burning Steppe must have gotten wind of Vermillions treacherous plans, and is now making moves to seize control of the nation herself, once the Chaos starts.\n\nStalwart knew that she couldn't fully deny Steppe, as that would cause many cossacks within her own army to leave at such an insult, but could she truly hand such forces to a potential enemy?\n\nOf course, if she did grant the rights, she could mandate the troops be send to Kucyków for training, which would make it quite the easy task to sow dissent in the ranks of the Cossacks...\nAccepting with subterfuge, or limiting the proposal as much as she dared, she would have to make a decision now, while she still had the advantage of momentum.
