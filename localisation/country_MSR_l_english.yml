MSR_Anal_Res_Ext:0 "Analyze Resource Extraction"
MSR_Anal_Res_Ext_desc:0 "When we send out scavenging teams, they just start searching for anything useful to us.

MSR_Auto_Eff:0 "Automated Efficiency"
MSR_Auto_Eff_desc:0 "There are so many mundane tasks that our scribes and knights are forced to do, in order to keep Bucklyn Cross running. This is a blatant waste of perfectly good ponypower; one that should not have gone unnoticed for this long.

MSR_Rev_Our_Army:0 "Review Our Armed Forces"
MSR_Rev_Our_Army_desc:0 "Our Steel Rangers have been a force reckon with within the ruins of Manehattan. However, they still can become better; it is just going to take some work. Luckily, I have all the time in the world now to make sure our Rangers are at their absolute best."

MSR_Looking_Out:0 "Looking Outwards"
MSR_Looking_Out_desc:0 "For too long, the Steel Rangers of Manehattan have been stuck in the background. Hiding away in Bucklyn Cross; surrounded on all sides by potential enemies.

MSR_Looking_Westward_desc:0 "The west is home to two very powerful factions; both of which hold vast quantities of land and resources.

MSR_Repairing_the_roads_desc:0 "With the lands to our east now secured, we can begin focus on some reconstruction efforts.

MSR_Moving_South_desc:0 "Just south of Bucklyn Cross lies a number of very minor factions; most of whom, have never presented a real threat to us.

MSR_Getting_Rid_Raiders:0 "Getting Rid of the Raiders"
MSR_Getting_Rid_Raiders_desc:0 "The Manhattan Raider groups have always been a constant thorn in our side; attacking our patrols, stealing our tech, and harassing our tributaries.

MSR_Clearing_Arbu_desc:0 "Arbu surprisingly tried to fight back against my sudden takeover; something I did not expect from them. They seemed like they were trying to hide something from us, but we haven't figured out what. Our best guess is that they might have some technology that they don't want us to have. I'll be sure to have some knights search every inch of that settlement once we clean up the last of the resistance."

MSR_Controlling_Ports:0 "Controlling the Ports"
MSR_Controlling_Ports_desc:0 "Portshoof may not seem like such a strategic location to others, but I know better.

MSR_Rebuilding_Dockyards:0 "Rebuilding the Dockyards"
MSR_Rebuilding_Dockyards_desc:0 "The Manehattan dockyards were once a bustling center of trade; shipping a plethora of goods to various locations. Now they are just another scrap heap in the ruins of the city. However, using some of our newly gained resources, we could attempt to get these docks back into working order. This could prove beneficial if we wish to increase our ability to trade, or even decide to build a navy of our own."

MSR_A_Wealth_Technology:0 "A Wealth of Technology"
MSR_A_Wealth_Technology_desc:0 "Ever since I completed my goal of becoming one with technology, the Steel Rangers have become more than I imagined. Not only have we had a territorial increase of well beyond 1000%, but we have increased out tech stockpiles way beyond their capacity. Never have I been prouder to see our mission come to pass; this is truly a great era for the Steel Rangers."

MSR_A_New_City_Rises:0 "A New City Rises"
MSR_A_New_City_Rises_desc:0 "I may have been called crazy in the past, but there is no doubt that I have brought greatness to the Steel Rangers. For the first time in 200 years, the entire city of Manehattan is under the control of a single faction. With the cities combined resources I could not just rebuild Bucklyn Cross, but the entire city of Manehattan. It may be a costly endeavor to take on, but it would also cement the Steel Ranger name into history, forever."

MSR_Reinforce_Old_Ways:0 "Reinforce the Old Ways"

MSR_Enforce_Lock_Down_desc:0 "Our enemies hunt us like animal; if we wish to protect ourselves, we must hide. Enacting the lockdown protocol will ensure that our enemies can't find us and our rangers stay say. It will be tuff to endure, but we do this for the greater good on out contingent."

MSR_Dissuade_Outside_Contact:0 "Dissuade Outside Contact"
MSR_Dissuade_Outside_Contact_desc:0 "Many of these outsiders carry diseases, leech off our limited resources, or have ulterior motives.

MSR_River:0 "River Autumn Becomes Elder?"
MSR_River_desc:0 "The provisional council has gone quiet. No one knows what has happened to them, but some are beginning to worry. That worry only increases when the sound of energy weapons can be heard from the Elders quarters."

MSR_The_New_Dev:0 "The New Elder"
MSR_The_New_Dev_desc:0 "As much as River Autumn wanted to dance on the ashes of her former Elder, she knew she couldn't celebrate just yet. There was still a long way to go before she could truly claim victory and declaring herself Elder was only the first step."

MSR_Giving_Out_Aid_desc:0 "In order to help secure our legitimacy of the New Equestrian Enclave within the wasteland, we need to start improving our nations image.

MSR_Healthcare_For_All:0 "Healthcare for All"
MSR_Healthcare_For_All_desc:0 "Free healthcare may seem like a giant waste of resources to almost anypony with half a brain, but I say otherwise.

MSR_Project_Purity:0 "Project Purity"
MSR_Project_Purity_desc:0 "I have been told on numerous occasions that this will be a massive waste of resources.

MSR_New_Construction_Methods_desc:0 "The Great War destroyed many old-world ideas; one of which being standardized construction methods.

MSR_Standardize_Production_desc:0 "For too long we have been reliant on any old-world equipment we could get out hooves on.

MSR_Expanding_Our_Borders_desc:0 "Our current position is pitiful. We are trapped within the ruins of Bucklyn with barely any room to stand, while struggling daily to gather enough recourses to get by.

MSR_Clearing_Out_Cannibals:0 "Clearing Out Cannibals"
MSR_Clearing_Out_Cannibals_desc:0 "I've been getting reports that there might be cannibals within the settlement of Arbu.

MSR_Pushing_Towards_Portshoof_desc:0 "Portshoof has become quite the center for trade. The vast amount of resources moving in and out of their markets is quite impressive. Such a shame that we will be confiscating it all."

MSR_Taking_Stable_29:0 "Taking Stable 29"
MSR_Taking_Stable_29_desc:0 "Stable 29 has always been of a place of great interest to the Steel Rangers, especially to Elder Cottage Cheese. If I wish to find out what was keeping the late Elder up every night, I will have to also deal with the Raiders the occupy the area around it."

MSR_Crossing_Into_Marelem:0 "Crossing into Marelem"
MSR_Crossing_Into_Marelem_desc:0 "Marelem sits right across the pond from us, quietly waiting for somepony to aid them against their raider neighbors. Well, that day has come, as the New Equestrian Enclave will gladly stand up and protect them. As long as they submit to us."

MSR_Dinner_In_Tenpony:0 "Dinner at Tenpony"
MSR_Dinner_In_Tenpony_desc:0 "Tenpony is quite a sight to see in the wasteland. And with how much they have to offer for those that can afford it, annexing them could provide quite a nice place for me to dine along with fellow officers and politicians."

MSR_Moving_To_End_Friendship:0 "Moving to End Friendship"
MSR_Moving_To_End_Friendship_desc:0 "Friendship City has always served as a safe haven for those that wish to try and escape the horrors of the wasteland. And as much as I admire what they are doing to help those in need, I also don't like seeing others trying to outdo my work."

MSR_Eastward_Expansion:0 "Eastward Expansion"
MSR_Eastward_Expansion_desc:0 "East of our territories lie a number of tribes who seem to only bumble about, rather than do anything worthwhile. Only through the power of civilization will these tribes ever become useful to society."

MSR_March_Along_the_Coast:0 "Shadow over Sunrise"
MSR_March_Along_the_Coast_desc:0 "The Sunrise region of the Equestrian Wasteland is home a number of varying nations who claim ownership of its lands. Such a pity that none of these nations know that, I too, lay claim to their lands."

MSR_Send_in_The_Peace_Keepers:0 "Send in the Peace Keepers"
MSR_Send_in_The_Peace_Keepers_desc:0 "It seems like not everypony appreciates being told that they are now part of the New Equestrian Enclave. That they will no longer have to worry about barely scrapping by, as we will be there to ensure their continued survival. Well, if they want to speak out against all the good things we are doing for them, then I will just have to show them how I deal with dissent."

MSR_Stirring_Up_Trouble:0 "Stirring Up Trouble"
MSR_Stirring_Up_Trouble_desc:0 "It seems like a new threat has begun to rub against our borders. This stallion, Red Eye, and his army of slavers are possibly the biggest threat we have ever seen. This will be our greatest challenge yet and we must use every advantage we can get if we hope to defeat them. Lucky for us, I think I have an idea."

MSR_Ending_Red_Eyes_Reign:0 "Ending Red Eye's Reign"
MSR_Ending_Red_Eyes_Reign_desc:0 "With our forces now in position and the rebels now properly armed, it is time to bring an end to Red Eye's parade. If we can win this war, nothing will stand in my way of achieving greatness."

MSR_Freeing_the_Enslaved_desc:0 "As I drive around Red Eye's former territories, I am greeted by the cheers and admiration of his former slaves. They view me as their hero in the wastes; a messiah sent to free them from their shackles. It fills my heart knowing that they think that they are truly free under my rule. But I won't say anything, as I would hate to spoil their fun."

MSR_Meeting_Old_Friends:0 "Meeting Old Friends"
MSR_Meeting_Old_Friends_desc:0 "It seems that the Fillydelphia Steel Rangers have managed to remain alive, even after all that has happened around them. Maybe I should go and pay them a visit, just to see how they are doing."

MSR_Retaking_the_Heartland:0 "Retaking the Heartland"
MSR_Retaking_the_Heartland_desc:0 "The New Equestrian Enclave stands on top; no other nation dares to threaten us. Our recent territorial gains have given us vast quantities of resources and ponypower which help to further my goals. With our position in the wasteland better than ever before, it is time to for us to move to the final stage of my ultimate plan. Retaking all of Equestria."

MSR_A_New_Equestrian_Army:0 "A New Equestrian Army"
MSR_A_New_Equestrian_Army_desc:0 "My forces are currently poorly organized, under trained, and barely disciplined. My only saving grace being that the majority of them are former Steel Ranger veterans. If we want to be able to stand hoof to hoof with those around us, I am going to have to reorganize my forces into a proper army."

MSR_A_Organized_Army:0 "An Organized Army"
MSR_A_Organized_Army_desc:0 "A well organized and well-equipped army stands above all who face it. Making sure every soldier has a proper rifle and equipment should be our top priority in the face of war."

MSR_Infantry_Support_Weapons:0 "Infantry Support Weapons"
MSR_Infantry_Support_Weapons_desc:0 "It would be wise to make sure that each of our divisions are properly supported. From medics to machine guns; maintenance to artillery. These Combat Support and Combat Service Support teams will be crucial in making sure our soldiers can stay in the fight."

MSR_Raining_Fire:0 "Raining Fire"
MSR_Raining_Fire_desc:0 "Thanks to our ever-expanding industrial base, we have begun the production of new Artillery guns that will surely turn the tables in our favor. These aptly named Earth Shakers will put the fear of Celestia into the hearts of any enemy who is unlucky enough to be within its firing range."

MSR_An_Highly_Mobile_Army:0 "A Highly Mobile Army"
MSR_An_Highly_Mobile_Army_desc:0 "A force that is quick enough to react to any situation is crucial to waging was in the wasteland. These motorized units will be able to outpace and foot soldier while still maintaining combat effectiveness."

MSR_Putting_Guns_On_Trucks:0 "Putting Guns on Trucks"
MSR_Putting_Guns_On_Trucks_desc:0 "Some of our soldiers have decided to add steel plates and heavy machine guns to some of the old trucks we have been repairing. At first it seemed like a waste of resources, but after reading about how well they have performed, I think it is time I gave them another look."

MSR_Beasts_of_Steel:0 "Beasts of Steel"
MSR_Beasts_of_Steel_desc:0 "Tanks were once considered to be an essential part of modern warfare, but thanks to the Great War, they are nothing more that massive scrap heaps. However, now that our industrial base has grown quite a considerable size, we could bring life back into these steel beasts."

MSR_Hiring_New_Generals:0 "Hiring New Generals"
MSR_Hiring_New_Generals_desc:0 "Thanks to those little purges of mine, we are entirely lacking a competent command staff.

Luckily, some of my contacts have informed me of some potential candidates that might just fit the bill."

MSR_Office_of_Internal_Integrity:0 "Office of Internal Integrity"
MSR_Office_of_Internal_Integrity_desc:0 "There will always be those who wish to speak out against, protest against, or even attempt to overthrow me.

MSR_Keeping_the_Peace:0 "Keeping the Peace"
MSR_Keeping_the_Peace_desc:0 "With threats looming around every corner, trying to ensure that peace is maintained within the state is going to be difficult to achieve. So, to remedy this, a specialized unit of enforces has been created to deal with any major threat thrown their way. These 'Peacekeepers' will become the spearhead for the New Equestrian Enclave military; installing fear into those who get in their way."

MSR_Service_Gurantees_Citizenship:0 "Service Guarantee's Citizenship"
MSR_Service_Gurantees_Citizenship_desc:0 "We can't just have anypony be considered a citizen of the New Equestrian Enclave; we only want the best. And only through serving the needs of the state could one even fathom the idea of becoming a citizen. Because, becoming a citizen should be considered a privilege and never something taken for granted."

MSR_Deployment_Groups:0 "Deployment Groups"
MSR_Deployment_Groups_desc:0 "As much as I resented how much the Steel Rangers worshiped power armor, you can't ignore how useful it is in combat.

MSR_Going_In_Guns_Blazing:0 "Going in Guns Blazing"
MSR_Going_In_Guns_Blazing_desc:0 "Power armor leaves little in the way of conducting operations behind enemy lines. The best we can do is have the units show up at a strategic location and start gunning down anything that moves. It may not be the best plan of action for these units, but they can still do some good for the war effort."

MSR_Vertibuck_Assault_Teams:0 "Vertibuck Assault Teams"
MSR_Vertibuck_Assault_Teams_desc:0 "To help increase the effectiveness of our Deployment Groups, we have allotted them the use of some of our recently built Vertibucks.

MSR_Special_Intervention_Force:0 "Special Intervention Force"
MSR_Special_Intervention_Force_desc:0 "Power armor may make you a walking tank, but when it comes to conducting special or covert operations, it is pretty much useless. What we need instead, are specially designated, organized, trained, and equipped forces, who can use unconventional means to wage war against our enemies."

MSR_Asymmetric_Warfare:0 "Asymmetric Warfare"
MSR_Asymmetric_Warfare_desc:0 "The Special Intervention Force knows that no amount of training or top of the line equipment will save them if they get into a fierce firefight.

MSR_Long_Range_Wasteland_Group:0 "Long Range Wasteland Group"
MSR_Long_Range_Wasteland_Group_desc:0 "Conducting operations outside our borders is in no way an easy task. These long-range special operations units will do everything within their power to make sure that any outside threat to this nation is swiftly dealt with.

MSR_Army_of_Freedom:0 "Army of 'Freedom'"
MSR_Army_of_Freedom_desc:0 "Never before has a military force of such standing professionalism been seen within the wasteland in over 200 years.

MSR_Hooves:0 "Steel Hooves Becomes Elder"

MSR_Hold_Speech:0 "Hold a Speech"
MSR_Hold_Speech_desc:0 "I am not one to give speeches, but I was told this might help to ease some of the tension building up. Let's just hope I don't mess this one up."

MSR_Talk_With_Paladins:0 "Talk with the Paladins"
MSR_Talk_With_Paladins_desc:0 "Many of the Paladins within this contingent weren't too happy when they heard that I was chosen as them next Elder. I think it would be wise to talk with them before they do something brash."

MSR_Meet_With_Scribes:0 "Meet with the Scribes"
MSR_Meet_With_Scribes_desc:0 "The scribes have always been partial to the politics of the Steel Rangers; focusing more on their work than what's going on around them. If I could convince them to support me, it could help in legitimizing my position."

MSR_Exile_Extremists:0 "Exile the Extremists"
MSR_Exile_Extremists_desc:0 "The Steel Rangers has always been home to a number of unsavory characters; ones who would rather do as they please without interference. I can't allow these types within our ranks and know that we must rid ourselves of them before they attempt to push back. It will be tuff to let so many Rangers go, but it must be done if we wish to change who we are."

MSR_Rid_The_Old_Ways:0 "Rid of the Old Ways"
MSR_Rid_The_Old_Ways_desc:0 "The old ways have held us back for a long time; preventing us from becoming something more. From our distrust of outsiders, to our complete obsession with technology. It is time we rid ourselves of these ideals and look towards something new."

MSR_Rally_The_Rangers:0 "Rally the Steel Rangers"
MSR_Rally_The_Rangers_desc:0 "With the majority of the Manehattan contingent on my side, it is time we rally them to our cause; only then can we begin to bring change to the Steel Rangers. The road ahead is going to be a tuff one and there will be many obstacles in our way. But if we stand united, we shall endure anything that comes our way."

MSR_Break_The_Chains:0 "Break the Chains"
MSR_Break_The_Chains_desc:0 "The 'Chain That Binds' is something that only brought more harm than good, when in it was implemented. My years in the military showed me that a flexible command structure works more efficiently than one that is rigid."

MSR_Change_Our_Approach:0 "Change our Approach"
MSR_Change_Our_Approach_desc:0 "Whenever we dealt with any kind of situation our approach always seemed to barge in and do as we please. I think it is time we find a more diplomatic approach to solving an issue and only start barging in when that option has truly failed."

MSR_Our_Original_Mission:0 "Our Original Mission"
MSR_Our_Original_Mission_desc:0 "We turned away almost any outsider who begged for our help, because they weren't one of us. We refused to shelter those who needed protection, leaving them to fend for themselves. I say, no more. For the first time in almost 200 years, we shall cast aside what made us who we are and find a new purpose in life. From this day forth, we shall dedicate ourselves to our original mission; protecting the ponies of Equestria from those who wish to do them harm."

### Steel Hooves Route ###

MSR_Steel_Rangers_Reborn:0 "Steel Rangers Reborn"
MSR_Steel_Rangers_Reborn_desc:0 "If we wish to try and distance ourselves from the Steel Rangers, we must come up with a new name for ourselves. I believe I have an idea that will not only honor our oaths to Equestria, but the mare that helped to create us."

MSR_Allow_More_Outsiders:0 "Allow More Outsiders"
MSR_Allow_More_Outsiders_desc:0 "There have been many ponies that have come to us eager to join, only for us to turn them away because of our policies against outsiders. However, after talking to some of the members of this contingent, I have found it not necessary to continue this policy. From now on, we will allow any able-bodied ponies into our ranks as fully fledged members of the Applejack Rangers."

MSR_Open_Up_Outside_Relations:0 "Open Up Outside Relations"
MSR_Open_Up_Outside_Relations_desc:0 "We have isolated ourselves for too long and the strain on resources is beginning to show itself. It would be a good idea to begin opening up relations with outside settlements if we wish to survive. We need to get the ball rolling on this, as it may take some time for settlements to agree to the idea of trading with us."

MSR_Increase_Patrols:0 "Increase Patrols"
MSR_Increase_Patrols_desc:0 "Before, patrol groups only patrolled the area immediately around Bucklyn Cross. I think it would be wise to not only increase the number of patrols we have, but also extend the area in which they patrol. This would allow us to better deter raider attacks, while also showing the local wastelanders that we are there to protect them."

MSR_Protecting_Wastelanders:0 "Protecting Wastelanders"
MSR_Protecting_Wastelanders_desc:0 "It seems our work is starting to pay off. Ponies in, and around, the Bucklyn area have begun to thank us for our service to them. With this initial success, I feel it is a good time to begin having groups of Rangers begin actively helping any wastelander that is moving through our territory. Hopefully this will continue to show outsiders that we can be trusted."

MSR_Support_Local_Settlement:0 "Support Local Settlements"
MSR_Support_Local_Settlement_desc:0 "With the success we are seeing in helping those within our territorial borders, many nearby settlements have asked us to help support them against possible raids. I didn't expect them to reach out to us so quickly, but that doesn't mean it is a bad thing. I am just happy that they are starting to see us as a group to seek help from."

MSR_Incentivize_Trade:0 "Incentivize Trade"
MSR_Incentivize_Trade_desc:0 "Trade talks have begun, but are moving at a snail's pace. Nearby settlements are still unwilling to conduct major trade with us, as they feel we really don't have much to offer them. Because of this, I have authorized that we allow the trade of some of our nonessential tech for these much-needed resources."

MSR_Support_Local_Caravans:0 "Support Local Caravans"
MSR_Support_Local_Caravans_desc:0 "With trade now starting to grow between us and a number of outside settlements. It would be wise to start giving out support for some of the caravans that help us conduct our business. If we show them how much we appreciate their work, they will be more likely to continue working with us."

MSR_Become_A_Force_For_Good:0 "Becoming a Force for Good"
MSR_Become_A_Force_For_Good_desc:0 "It is high time we truly show the wasteland that we are a force for good. No longer will we bring unwarranted harm to those who peacefully cross our paths. From here on out, we will strive to show the wasteland that there is still good within the heart of every Equestrian."

MSR_A_Fork_In_The_Road:0 "A Fork in the Road"
MSR_A_Fork_In_The_Road_desc:0 "Even though so much good has been done by the Applejack Rangers, there is still a lot of work to do. However, I am unsure if I want to continue doing all this work; I need some time to think."

MSR_Manehattan_Treaty_Organization:0 "Manehattan Treaty Organization"
MSR_Manehattan_Treaty_Organization_desc:0 "With how harsh the Equestrian Wasteland can be, the idea of a multi-settlement treaty organization centered within ruin of Manehattan could benefit many. With this type of treaty organization, we could ensure both military and economic cooperation with those who wish to join. It won't be easy to create, but with enough time it could bring stability to this region."

MSR_Offer_Membership_To_Others:0 "Offer Membership to Others"
MSR_Offer_Membership_To_Others_desc:0 "With the charter drafter and the paperwork almost complete, it is now time to move to the next step of this plan. We will send out a number of evnoys to some of the surrounding settlements, asking if they wish to join the MTO. Hopefully we can gain a few new member-settlements."

MSR_Create_A_Mutual_Defense_Pact:0 "Create a Mutual Defense Pact"
MSR_Create_A_Mutual_Defense_Pact_desc:0 "Now that we have a number of member-settlement in the MTO now, it is time to gather the representatives of each settlement and start getting to work. Our first order of business is to ensure that each settlement is ready in the event that another member-state is attacked. Because if one state is attacked, all states are attacked."

MSR_Joint_Military_Exercises:0 "Joint Military Exercises"
MSR_Joint_Military_Exercises_desc:0 "In order to make sure that each settlement is ready for the event of a sudden attack, we have devised a number of joint military exercises to be conducted. It will be hard on them at first, as many of these settlements have never had anything more than a militia force to protect them. But by the time we are done, those militia forces will come ready to face anything."

MSR_Aid_In_Re_Industrialization:0 "Aid in Re-industrialization"
MSR_Aid_In_Re_Industrialization_desc:0 "Helping to build industry within each member-settlement is big factor in ensuring their survival. So, we have agreed to lend a number of our scribes out to help the settlements understand what it will take to create an industrial base from scratch."

MSR_Manehattan_Recovery_Program:0 "Manehattan Recovery Program"
MSR_Manehattan_Recovery_Program_desc:0 "The survival of each member-settlement is key to the survival of the MTO as a whole. Because of this, we have decided to lend whatever resources we can spare to every member-settlement. It may put a strain on our resources for some time, but it will do much good for all of us in the long run."

MSR_Keeping_The_Flame:0 "Keeping the Flame"
MSR_Keeping_The_Flame_desc:0 "There is still so much that can be done to improve the situation withing Manehattan. I can't stop, won't stop until I ensure that the safety of all who live here is guaranteed."

MSR_Carrying_On_A_Memory:0 "Carrying on a Memory"
MSR_Carrying_On_A_Memory_desc:0 "Though Applejack is all but a memory for me now, her dream of helping those in need still reside within me. I never realized the good we could have done if we followed her example instead of hiding away. It is time we carry that dream in honor of her, so that its message can be seen by all of the Equestrian Wasteland."

MSR_Talk_With_Crossroads:0 "Talk with Crossroads"
MSR_Talk_With_Crossroads_desc:0 "Crossroads has been very vocal about her animosity towards some of the decisions I have made. She says that the Applejack Rangers are changing too rapidly, causing us to alienate many former Rangers. I understand her concerns, but I know I will have to talk with her in the hopes of making her realize that costs that come with change."

MSR_Remember_Our_Oaths:0 "Remember Our Oaths"
MSR_Remember_Our_Oaths_desc:0 "When the Steel Rangers were first created, we all took an oath; one that stated that we would protect and defend Equestria and its citizens. Since the Great War, that oath has been lost to time; replaced with a more twisted version. For too long we have followed this false oath and it is high time we rid ourselves of it and return to our roots. It is time we remember our oaths to Equestria and, once again, swear to protect her. Even in her darkest hour."

MSR_Embracing_Outsiders:0 "Embracing Outsiders"
MSR_Embracing_Outsiders_desc:0 "We have had outsiders within our ranks for some time now, but it seems like there are still some who hold animosity towards them. It is shameful to see so called 'Brothers in Hooves' distrust one another and put their lives in possible jeopardy. We must show them that these outsiders are not only to be trusted, but embraced, as if they were an old friend."

MSR_The_Spirit_Of_Honesty:0 "The Spirit of Honesty"
MSR_The_Spirit_Of_Honesty_desc:0 "Applejack represented the spirit of honesty as she was always willing to tell the truth, no matter what. She went above and beyond to help, not just her friends, but anypony that needed help. If we want to continue to show the wasteland that the Applejack Rangers are their friends, we must strive to follow her example."

MSR_An_Unwavering_Vision:0 "An Unwavering Vision"
MSR_An_Unwavering_Vision_desc:0 "We have come so far in the past couple of years, more than I thought we ever would. Our fledgling organization, built from the ashes of the Steel Rangers, has become a beacon of hope within the wasteland. No more will the ponies of the wasteland be fearful of what may lay around the corner, as we will be there to help them along the way. There is a long road ahead of us, but I believe that if we stray true to our vision, nothing will stand in our way."

MSR_Investigate_Arbu:0 "Investigate Arbu"
MSR_Investigate_Arbu_desc:0 "Some of our scouts have begun noticing strange things happening at Arbu. Let's hope their post-op reports can shed some light on the situation."

MSR_Take_Out_The_Empire:0 "Take Out the Empire"
MSR_Take_Out_The_Empire_desc:0 "The Empires power within the Manhattan region has been growing for quite some time. Their forces lining against our borders; threatening our sovereignty. Because of this, we had put plans in place to preemptively strike their positions with the hopes of taking their forces out in one fell swoop."

MSR_Crush_The_Manehattan_Raiders:0 "Crush the Manehattan Raiders"
MSR_Crush_The_Manehattan_Raiders_desc:0 "The Manhattan Raiders have been a threat in the region to too long. Their blatant disregard for pony life is something we won't stand for. It is high time that the swift hoof of justice is brought down on them and their reign of terror ended."

MSR_Deal_With_The_Rain_Raiders:0 "Deal with the Rain Raiders"
MSR_Deal_With_The_Rain_Raiders_desc:0 "The Rain Raiders continue to be a threat to anypony traveling within the area. If we wish to ensure the safety of all travelers coming to the Manehattan ruins, we will have to take them out for good."

MSR_Passing_The_Torch:0 "Passing the Torch"
MSR_Passing_The_Torch_desc:0 "It was unexpected to say the least; I never thought I would even be considered for elder. But with how fast thing are changing around here, some are looking towards as a voice of reason. It will be tuff task to endure, but hopefully by then end of it, I can bring some balance back to the Applejack Rangers."

MSR_Necessary_Compromise:0 "Necessary Compromise"
MSR_Necessary_Compromise_desc:0 "Steel Hooves may have initially had the right idea; working to make the Steel Rangers a force for good. But he tried to change too many things too quickly, causing rifts to form within our ranks. If we wish to keep ourselves from collapsing, I need to make some compromises to appease the more hardline groups."

MSR_Realism_Not_Idealism:0 "Realism, Not Idealism"
MSR_Realism_Not_Idealism_desc:0 "Steel Hooves was so focused on changing the Steel Rangers into something new, that he lost sight of what was going on in front of him. His new policies were pushing away many of his former supporters while forcing us to give up more of our resources. Though his intentions were noble, they were in no way grounded in reality."

MSR_Remember_Our_Mission:0 "Remember Our Mission"
MSR_Remember_Our_Mission_desc:0 "We cannot hold ourselves to such old-world ideas. As much as our oaths still hold meaning to our cause, they also have us swear loyalty for a nation that does not exist anymore. The only thing we can hold ourselves too now is collecting and securing harmful technology from those who wish to use it for malice."

MSR_Bring_Back_The_Outcasts:0 "Bring Back the Outcasts"
MSR_Bring_Back_The_Outcasts_desc:0 "When Steel Hooves began reforming the Steel Rangers into the Applejack Rangers, he forced a large number of non-supporters out. In doing this, we lost a lot of ponies with both valuable skill and equipment. I feel that Steel Hooves was too harsh on some of them and that we should allow some of them to return."

MSR_The_Supremacy_Of_Steel:0 "The Supremacy of Steel"
MSR_The_Supremacy_Of_Steel_desc:0 "The Equestrian Wasteland is unforgiving and steel, not honesty, is the best policy within the wasteland. It takes more than sharing your true emotions to survive; you need guts, grits, and a lot of guns. We are called the Steel Rangers for a reason, and it wasn't because we shared our feelings with each other."

MSR_A_Reasonable_View:0 "A Reasonable View"
MSR_A_Reasonable_View_desc:0 "Steel Hooves thought that he could bring forth change in a matter of weeks, but all it did was divide us even more. If I not had been chosen to be Elder when I did, the Applejack Rangers would not have lasted more than a year. I may not have been as idealistic as Steel Hooves was, but I have still set the Applejack Rangers on the right path."

MSR_Bucklyn_Defense_Initiative:0 "Bucklyn Defense Initiative"
MSR_Bucklyn_Defense_Initiative_desc:0 "The need to protect ourselves is great, but something we can't do alone. Even with all the changes we have enacted, we are still not the most liked group within the wasteland. I think it is high time we create some kind of defense initiative to make sure that safety of Bucklyn is ensured."

MSR_Convince_Others_To_Join:0 "Convince Others to Join"
MSR_Convince_Others_To_Join_desc:0 "In order for this initiative to succeed, we need other settlements to act as buffer states for us. But that requires them to willingly joins us; something the other settlements might not agree too. So, to remedy that, we'll make sure that that don't have much of a choice in the matter."

MSR_Offer_Military_Protection:0 "'Offer' Military Protection"
MSR_Offer_Military_Protection_desc:0 "Now that we were able to 'convince' all of these settlements to join our little defense pact, we can begin to move troops into their territories. This is to ensure that our 'allies' are properly protected from any outside threat. It would be a shame to see them get pushed over by some raider group, now wouldn't it."

MSR_Create_A_Technology_Tax:0 "Create a Technology Tax"
MSR_Create_A_Technology_Tax_desc:0 "With the safety of our 'allies' ensured; we can begin to focus on creating some reforms. Our first order of business is to institute a technology tax within their territories. This is to help compensate for the fact that we are deploying so many of our Rangers outside Bucklyn. It will in no way hurt their economic situation, as long as they comply."

MSR_Seize_Illegal_Technology:0 "Seize 'Illegal' Technology"
MSR_Seize_Illegal_Technology_desc:0 "Seems like some of our 'allies' have been secretly hoarding technology from us. This will not do at all; how are we supposed to trust each other if them do things like this. Looks like I am going to have to send some Rangers in to seize these stockpiles and ensure that our allies don't go behind my back again."

MSR_Occupy_Strategic_Locations:0 "Occupy Strategic Locations"
MSR_Occupy_Strategic_Locations_desc:0 "It has been confirmed that some of our 'allies' have locations of strategic importance within their territories. These locations could prove useful to us given that we are allowed to take them over. It should be a relatively simple task, but we must also be prepared just in case they refuse."

MSR_A_City_In_Ruins:0 "A City in Ruins"
MSR_A_City_In_Ruins_desc:0 "Manehattan was once one of the largest centers of trade and commerce in Equestria. Now, it sits in ruin; slowly wasting away. It's about time somepony changes that. Thanks to our technological knowhow and military might, we will begin to rebuild this glorified junk yard into a prosperous community."

MSR_Repairing_Bucklyn_Cross:0 "Repairing Buckyln Cross"
MSR_Repairing_Bucklyn_Cross_desc:0 "Bucklyn Cross may be our home, but it is also a logistical nightmare. Almost every road in and out of the area is covered by some sort of hazard. If we wish to be able to carry out operations with relative ease, we need to make sure our supply and communication lines are fully open to us."

MSR_Securing_Bucklyn_Proper_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our supply routes withing Bucklyn Cross; it would be wise to move towards cleaning up Bucklyn proper. Doing so would allow us to not only expand our area of operation within Manehattan, but also expand our ability to trade."

MSR_Rebuilding_Rail_Lines:0 "Rebuilding the Rail Lines"
MSR_Rebuilding_Rail_Lines_desc:0 "Bucklyn was once home to a system of commuter trains that allowed ponies to move around the city with ease. There is great potential if we could find a way to repair these rails lines. Doing so, would not only increase our ability to move supplies around, but also allow for the rapid deployment of our troops."

MSR_Arms_Salvaging:0 "Arms Salvaging"
MSR_Arms_Salvaging_desc:0 "A Steel Ranger is nothing more than a glorified civilian without their equipment. So, in order to make sure each Steel Ranger is properly armed and equipped, we must increase our efforts in salvaging pre-war military warehouses."

MSR_Hiring_Weaponsmith:0 "Hiring Weaponsmiths"
MSR_Hiring_Weaponsmith_desc:0 "As our military strength continues to grow, so does out need for more equipment. Scavenging isn't going to meet are expanding needs as it once did. So, we have begun hiring weaponsmiths to aid in the production of new equipment."

MSR_Vigilant_Recycling:0 "Vigilant Recycling"
MSR_Vigilant_Recycling_desc:0 "Waste not, want not. From toasters to broken MEW's; every piece of scrap technology can be broken down into useable parts. Making sure we recycle every piece of broken technology we come across, will ensure we never run out of these vital components."

MSR_Foundries_Of_Steel:0 "Foundries of Steel"
MSR_Foundries_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Our military-industrial complex has grown to such a point that not even the weaponsmiths can keep up. So, to remedy this, we have begun converting some of the old factories into centers of arms production. Never again will we have to scavenge the leftovers of the old world for new equipment."

MSR_Metailurgy_Reborn:0 "Metallurgy Reborn"
MSR_Metailurgy_Reborn_desc:0 "As the Steel Rangers continue to grow, so does our need for more advanced metals. Lucky for us, we have been able to find a number of holotapes containing information on the science of metallurgy. Thanks to these, we should be able to produce more refined alloys."

MSR_Stripping_World_Facilities:0 "Stripping Old-World Facilities"
MSR_Stripping_World_Facilities_desc:0 "If we want to be able to produce more advanced equipment, we must maintain a large stockpile of advanced components. However, the only way to do that is by stripping every pre-war government complex and research facility we come across. It will be highly dangerous work, but our need for these parts outweigh those costs."

MSR_Back_Yard_Forages:0 "Back Yard Forages"
MSR_Back_Yard_Forages_desc:0 "If we wish to continue our efforts in rebuilding Manehattan, we need to first build up an industrial base. Though it will start off rather small, given enough time we could soon turn Manehattan back into the industrial center on Equestria."

MSR_Civilian_Labor_Corp:0 "Civilian Labor Corp"
MSR_Civilian_Labor_Corp_desc:0 "There are a number of ponies who have made their way to Manehattan in the hopes of seeking shelter with us. And even though we loath the idea of doing charity work, a number of these ponies hold skills that we are sorely lacking in. Because of this we have begun hiring them on to start doing work that our own scribes could care less about."

MSR_City_Of_Steel:0 "City of Steel"
MSR_City_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Bucklyn, even in the ruined state it is, can still serve a great purpose to us. Many of the old structures were made from a multitude of metals that we could easily reuse for our own benefit. Thanks to this, we are certain we will never run out of scrap to use."

MSR_Rebuilding_Old_Canneries:0 "Repairing the Old Canneries"
MSR_Rebuilding_Old_Canneries_desc:0 "Reconstruction is going slow, but steady. Our industrial base has taken roots which has allowed us to look into expanding it. Lucky for us, there are some old canneries nearby that are still in decent condition. Hopefully with a little TLC, we can get them back into working order."

MSR_Repairing_The_Generators:0 "Repairing the Generators"
MSR_Repairing_The_Generators_desc:0 "Electricity is crucial to our survival. It is what keeps the factories running, the communications flowing, and our weapon systems operating. So, in order to keep up with the ever-increasing demand, we must continue to rebuild and repair any power generator we come across."

MSR_Buckyln_Reborn:0 "Bucklyn Reborn"
MSR_Buckyln_Reborn_desc:0 "It has taken us quite some time, but it was worth all of the hardships. Thanks to the efforts of every Steel Ranger and wasteland volunteer, the once desolate ruins of Bucklyn have been transformed into a thriving community. No longer are we hiding away in Bucklyn Cross, fearful of what lay in the ruins. No longer are we barely managing to scrape together enough supplies to get by on. Our factories produce new equipment for us; while our repaired roads allow for ease of trade with the outside. The industrial might of Equestria is waking once more, and the Steel Rangers shall be there to guide it every step of the way."

### Army Tree ###

MSR_Army_Reorganization:0 "Army Reorganization"
MSR_Army_Reorganization_desc:0 "Thanks to all the political infighting, our armed forces have become somewhat neglected over the past years. This is something we cannot have. We must reorganize and reevaluate our forces if we hope to still be able to put up a fight."

MSR_Combat_Log:0 "Pre-War Combat Logs"
MSR_Combat_Log_desc:0 "A wise pony once said that "if one wants to define the future, they must study the past.". And study the past we shall. Our vast collection of pre-war combat logs provides us with valuable information involving numerous types of military engagements. With these logs, we can better understand what the militaries of the past did right and what they did wrong. From there, we should be able to formulate new plans that better fit the battlefields of today."

MSR_Raider_Wars:0 "Raider Wars"
MSR_Raider_Wars_desc:0 "Given our plethora resources and weapons, we are a prime target for raider factions. Though some of these wars have been costly, they have given us valuable amounts of combat logs that we can review. With each new combat log, we can come up better plans and tactics to use against these varying groups."

MSR_Combat_Simulation:0 "Combat Simulations"
MSR_Combat_Simulation_desc:0 "Though it will never be as good as experiencing a battle firsthoof. The use of simulations has been a proven military training tactic since before the Great War. And they can still provide us with the necessary training needed if these certain situations are to arise during combat."

MSR_Reverse_Engineering:0 "Reverse Engineering"
MSR_Reverse_Engineering_desc:0 "Thanks to the hard work of our scribes, we now have a better understanding of our magical energy weapons. Hopefully this will allow us to better streamline our production of them; along with reducing their overall production cost."

MSR_Old_World:0 "Old World Efficiency"
MSR_Old_World_desc:0 "Why try to fix something if it isn't broken? That's the thought when it comes to whether we should upgrade our magical energy weapons. We have been using the same MEW's for centuries now and they have more than proved themselves reliable."

MSR_New_World:0 "New World Design"
MSR_New_World_desc:0 "Though our MEW's of old have done us well, they are beginning to show their age. Luckily, our scribes have been prototyping an advanced MEW weapon system. This step towards the future is essential to keeping ourselves in the fight, though it does mean we will have to move more resources towards their production."

MSR_Routine_Maintenance:0 "Routine Maintenance"
MSR_Routine_Maintenance_desc:0 "Our power armor is centuries old and could easily breakdown in combat. In trying to prevent this, the scribes have implemented a routine maintenance program for all of our power armor. With this in place, our armor will always be combat ready."

MSR_Streamlined_Parts:0 "Streamlined Parts"
MSR_Streamlined_Parts_desc:0 "Some of the scribes have concluded that we could easily streamline the production of power armor, given enough time. This would greatly increase the number of units we can produce. However, it would also decrease the reliability of the power armor, as well as, compromise some of its integrity."

MSR_Reinforced_Alloys:0 "Reinforced Alloy's"
MSR_Reinforced_Alloys_desc:0 "Some of the scribes have found a way to reinforce our power armor with a new type of super alloy. With this alloy added into the power armor, the hull integrity would increase significantly. Though it would make producing power armor more costly."

MSR_PBF:0 "Pony's Best Friend. Reinvented, again."
MSR_PBF_desc:0 "Robots were once a vital asset to the Equestrian war effort. However, many now lie in scrap piles collecting rest. It might be beneficial to start looking into researching them once again, as they could prove a valuable asset."

MSR_Legion_Of_Steel:0 "Legions of Steel"
MSR_Legion_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Robots are nothing more than the perfect cannon fodder. Make their design simple enough and you could field thousands of them. Then all you have to do is sit back and watch them soften up the enemy before sending in the more valuable troops in to clean up."

MSR_Mobile_Weapon_System:0 "Mobile Weapon Systems"
MSR_Mobile_Weapon_System_desc:0 "Robronco had the right idea when creating heavy assault robots like the sentinels. Their increased armor and compliment of weaponry more than outweigh their costly production. Having these mobile tanks on our side would give us a massive advantage on the battlefield."

MSR_Promoting_Initiates:0 "Promoting Initiates"
MSR_Promoting_Initiates_desc:0 "With our ponypower reserves starting to faulter, we have decided to hasten the promotion of many of our initiates. They may have not fully finished their training, but this influx will hopefully fill in a number of gaps we have. It may not be the most ideal situation, but we don't really have time to argue about that."

MSR_Wasteland_Conscription:0 "Wasteland Conscription"
MSR_Wasteland_Conscription_desc:0 "In order to keep up our strength we need to have a constant flow of new recruits. However, the problem is that the number of our foals coming of age to join the Steel Rangers is still low. Because of this, we have authorized the conscription of 'outsiders' who show interest and/or loyalty to us, in the hopes of bolstering our numbers."

MSR_Multirole_Training:0 "Multirole Training"
MSR_Multirole_Training_desc:0 "We have recently come across some old military texts that talk about something called 'Multirole Training'. This training was supposed to allow soldiers to do each other's jobs incase certain specialists were 'incapacitated'. With this in mind, we shall immediately begin implementing this 'Multirole Training' into our regular training courses. Hopefully this will increase the number of combat ready troops we have."

MSR_Rangers_Lead_The_Way:0 "Ranger Lead the Way"
MSR_Rangers_Lead_The_Way_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts both the Paladins and Scribes, we have been able to completely overhaul how our armed forces function. They are better trained and better equipped to deal with what the wasteland throws at them. Now nothing can stand in the way of the Steel Rangers. Ad Victoriam!"

#MSR.1.title:0 "The MAS hub"
#MSR.1.desc:0 "MSRpony Tower. A luxury hotel, known for housing the Ministry of Arcane Science's ManehatMSR Hub. When Balefire began raining from the sky, those ponies working within the Hub were some of the first to know. Orders came in from Canterlot to fire the prototype megaspell Celestia One at Roam, capital of the Zebra empire. Knowing that ManehatMSR would be a primary target, the ponies of the Ministry had to make a choice. They could follow their orders and focus on casting the megaspell, or ignore their orders and focus on using the ManehatMSR Emergency Broadcasting System to warn the residents of the city. There wouldn't be enough time to do both, and the seconds were ticking down."

MSR.4.a:0 "Focus our efforts on growing our economy."
MSR.4.b:0 "Focus on rebuilding our military capacity."

MSR.5.title:0 "Gaining Support"

MSR.6.title:0 "Final Decision"
MSR.6.desc:0 "Our path forward must not be rot with petty arguments and ideological quarals. We must choose a single path forward that all of us can agree with."
MSR.6.a:0 "We must focus our efforts to the common pony. Without them, we are nothing."
MSR.6.b:0 "The preservation of technology is our only focus. And nothing else."
MSR.6.c:0 "There is more to the Steel Rangers than technology. We just have to find it."
MSR.6.d:0 "Why bother with the filth of the wasteland. They'll only drag us down."
