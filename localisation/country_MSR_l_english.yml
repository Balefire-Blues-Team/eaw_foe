### EVENTS ###
##############
#MSR.1.title:0 "The MAS hub"
#MSR.1.desc:0 "MSRpony Tower. A luxury hotel, known for housing the Ministry of Arcane Science's ManehatMSR Hub. When Balefire began raining from the sky, those ponies working within the Hub were some of the first to know. Orders came in from Canterlot to fire the prototype megaspell Celestia One at Roam, capital of the Zebra empire. Knowing that ManehatMSR would be a primary target, the ponies of the Ministry had to make a choice. They could follow their orders and focus on casting the megaspell, or ignore their orders and focus on using the ManehatMSR Emergency Broadcasting System to warn the residents of the city. There wouldn't be enough time to do both, and the seconds were ticking down."
#MSR.1.a:0 "Sound the Emergency Broadcast System"
#MSR.1.b:0 "Fire Celestia One!"
MSR.1.title:0 "The Survivors"
MSR.1.desc:0 "We never expected it to come to this. The city around us burned while we just stood there, doing nothing. Eventually a stallion, possibly a commanding officer, began yelling at us, trying to get us to do something. But with the world ending right infront of us, what can we do?"
MSR.1.a:0 "Look for supplies before leaving."
MSR.1.b:0 "Look for survivors before leaving."
MSR.1.c:0 "Embrace the Darkness"

MSR_Continue_1.title:0 "Foundations of Steel"
MSR_Continue_1.desc:0 "The war has thrown us back to the stone age and if we wish to survive, we must rebuild. What industry do we want to rebuild first?"
MSR_Continue_1.a:0 "Fix up the old cannery."
MSR_Continue_1.b:0 "Rebuild the munitions factory."

#MSR.3.title:0 "Rising Phoenix"
#MSR.3.desc:0 "It is time we focus on strengthening ourselves. Only through our understanding of pre-war tech and years of experiance combating the horros created by the balefire, can we defend our claim in this wasteland."

MSR.4.title:0 "Foraged Steel"
MSR.4.desc:0 "Technology is the only true way to move forward. We must salvage and rebuild as much as we can if we wish to not just survive, but thrive."
MSR.4.a:0 "Focus our efforts on growing our economy."
MSR.4.b:0 "Focus on rebuilding our military capacity."

#MSR.5.title:0 "Gaining Support"
#MSR.5.desc:0 "Our path forward must not be rot with petty arguments and ideological quarals. We must choose a single path forward that all of us can agree with."

MSR.6.title:0 "Final Decision"
MSR.6.desc:0 "Our path forward must not be rot with petty arguments and ideological quarals. We must choose a single path forward that all of us can agree with."
MSR.6.a:0 "We must focus our efforts to the common pony. Without them, we are nothing."
MSR.6.b:0 "The preservation of technology is our only focus. And nothing else."
MSR.6.c:0 "There is more to the Steel Rangers than technology. We just have to find it."
MSR.6.d:0 "Why bother with the filth of the wasteland. They'll only drag us down."

#MSR.7.title:0 "Staying On The Beaten Path"
#MSR.7.desc:0 "It was a good feeling knowing that the contingent still believed in honoring tradition. Even with all the political divisions caused by Steel Hooves and Autumn River, the Steel Rangers of the Manehattan Contingent stood true to their oaths to Equestria. Now with power firmly back in the hooves of those who know how to properly wield it, Elder Cottage Cheese wasted no time getting things back into order."
#MSR.7.a:0 "Glad that's finally over."

#MSR.8.title:0 "A Means To An End"
#MSR.8.desc:0 "Standing over the ashes of what once was Elder Cottage Cheese, a smile began to form on Autumn River’s face. Though this was only the beginning of her plan and there would be much turmoil down the road. She felt that she was wholly justified in her action against her former elder. The Steel Rangers were a broken and corrupt group of technophiles. Only through the guidance of Elder River Autumn, would they ever know true prosperity."
#MSR.8.a:0 "What have you done!"

#MSR.9.title:0 "New Horizons"
#MSR.9.desc:0 "It was a difficult choice, but ultimately the right one. Steel Hooves knew that this wouldn’t be easy, but it had to be done. For too long, the Steel Rangers took anything they believed was rightfully theirs. Now it was time for change. Tossing away the ideals of old, the Steel Rangers would forage a new path for themselves. A path that would hopefully see them as protectors of the wasteland."
#MSR.9.a:0 "Hopefully we made the right choice."

#MSR.10.title:0 "Takeing The Road Less Traveled"
#MSR.10.desc:0 "It was unexpected to say the least. Paladin Crossroads never though she would even be considered for elder. But with how divided the contingent has become, many have looked to her as a voice of reason. A strong balance between those who wish to stay on the path and those who wish to veer right off it. It would be tuff task to endure, but hopefully by then end of it, the Steel Rangers will find their place in the wasteland."
#MSR.10.a:0 "A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one."
