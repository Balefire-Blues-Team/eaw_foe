MSR_Cottage_Council:0 "The Council"
MSR_Cottage_Council_desc:0 "The provisional council was just a temporary means to solve the issue of who would be Elder of this contingent. So, is there really any need to keep them around?"

MSR_Securing_Info:0 "Securing Information"

MSR_A_New_Objective:0 "A New Objective"
MSR_A_New_Objective_desc:0 "Now that we have discovered the location of a functional Crusader Maneframe, all that's left to do is to actually secure said maneframe. Unfortunately, it is currently within the domain of a bunch of bloodthirsty raiders. In much better news, it seems that they lack advanced power armor and proper weaponry. There's only one way that this can end."

MSR_The_Mainframe:0 "The Maneframe"

MSR_The_Black_Book:0 "The Black Book"
MSR_The_Black_Book_desc:0 "I did it! I found the location of this so called 'Black Book'. The only problem is that it is located within the ruins of Canterlot. This will prove difficult, but if I can persuade some Rangers to go in, I may be able to complete this project."

MSR_A_New_Era:0 "A New Era for the Steel Rangers"
MSR_A_New_Era_desc:0 "With my mind and soul now fully integrated into the Crusader Maneframe, it is time to get to work. There is so much that I can do; so many new avenues opening up.

MSR_Review_Our_Ind:0 "Review Our Industry"
MSR_Review_Our_Ind_desc:0 "Our industry is something I am proud of, but I know it can grow beyond its current state. Hopefully, with my new found processing power, I can work to increase our industrial capabilities to pre-war standards."

MSR_Recal_Ind_Out:0 "Recalculate Industrial Output"
MSR_Recal_Ind_Out_desc:0 "Our scribes work on repairing or stripping technology individually. This process is only effective if they are given small batches of technology at a time. With some simple calculations, I am sure I could help increase the scribes' technological output by at least 70%."

MSR_Anal_Res_Ext:0 "Analyze Resource Extraction"
MSR_Anal_Res_Ext_desc:0 "When we send out scavenging teams, they just start searching for anything useful to us. This process of scavenging is greatly inefficient and feels almost like a waste of their time. However, using my new capabilities, I will be able to reorganize our scavenging teams into highly efficient resource extractors."

MSR_Auto_Eff:0 "Automated Efficiency"
MSR_Auto_Eff_desc:0 "There are so many mundane tasks that our scribes and knights are forced to do in order to keep Bucklyn Cross running. This is a blatant waste of perfectly good ponypower; one that should not have gone unnoticed for this long. Now that I am in control of our base's robots, I intend to make good use of those old Mr. Handy's."

MSR_Rev_Our_Army:0 "Review Our Armed Forces"
MSR_Rev_Our_Army_desc:0 "Our Steel Rangers have been a force to be reckoned with within the ruins of Manehattan. However, they still can become better; it is just going to take some work. Luckily, I have all the time in the world now to make sure our Rangers are at their absolute best."

MSR_Eval_Ranger_Training:0 "Evaluate Ranger Training Programs"
MSR_Eval_Ranger_Training_desc:0 "The training to become a Steel Ranger is something to not be taken lightly. I should know, I went through it. However, I know I can do more to make sure the training the initiates receive is truly the best.

MSR_Enforce_Chain_Binds:0 "Enforcing the Chain That Bind"
MSR_Enforce_Chain_Binds_desc:0 "The Chain That Binds is the cornerstone of our organization, the rock that supports the great tree of the Steel Rangers and its myriad of branches.

MSR_A_New_Army:0 "A New Army of Steel"
MSR_A_New_Army_desc:0 "Our troops have been more of a glorified defense force, rather than a fully-fledged army. But, thanks to my now endless computing capability and increased lifespan, I have been able to drastically change how our armed forces function. Soon, the wasteland will tremble at the might of the Manehattan Steel Rangers!"

MSR_Looking_Out:0 "Looking Outwards"
MSR_Looking_Out_desc:0 "For too long, the Steel Rangers of Manehattan have been stuck in the background. Hiding away in Bucklyn Cross; surrounded from all sides by potential enemies. It is time we stand up and say no more. We will rise, like a phoenix from its ashes, and take back the city of Manehattan for ourselves."

MSR_Looking_Westward:0 "Looking Westward"
MSR_Looking_Westward_desc:0 "The west is home to two very powerful factions, both of which hold vast quantities of land and resources.

MSR_Enter_New_Trotbany:0 "Entering New Trotbany"
MSR_Enter_New_Trotbany_desc:0 "Just like when the Visigoths marched into Roam after conquering the city, so did my Steel Rangers march into New Trotbany as conquerors.

MSR_A_Summer_In_Summer:0 "A Summer in Summerfield"
MSR_A_Summer_In_Summer_desc:0 "Before the Great War, Summerfield was supposed to be a quiet suburb. Where young couples would go to start families and old couples would live out the rest of their lives. Nowadays, it sits in a state of ruin, rotting away as raiders turned it into their home. Maybe after we clear out the raiders, we could turn this trash heap back into something livable."

MSR_Repairing_the_roads:0 "Repairing the Roadways"
MSR_Repairing_the_roads_desc:0 "With the lands to our east now secured, we can begin focusing on some reconstruction efforts. There isn't much out in this region, but there are a number of old roads that could serve some purpose. If we spend the time and resources to repair them, I calculate that both our trade and military deployment speed would increase by at least 35%."

MSR_Moving_South:0 "Moving South"
MSR_Moving_South_desc:0 "Just south of Bucklyn Cross lies a number of very minor factions; most of whom, have never presented a real threat to us. However, if any one of them gained full control of the peninsula, then they would pose a threat to our security. So, in order to prevent that, we will move in and secure the region before any of them can."

MSR_Breaking_Peninsula:0 "Breaking the Peninsula"
MSR_Breaking_Peninsula_desc:0 "There is still much resistance to my rule within the Manehattan peninsula. They may not be privy to our sudden arrival, but they must understand that we are here to do them good. However, if they still won't accept me as their new guardian, I will gladly show them why they shouldn't disobey my rule."

MSR_Getting_Rid_Raiders:0 "Getting Rid of the Raiders"
MSR_Getting_Rid_Raiders_desc:0 "Even after we destroyed the bulk of their raider forces, the Manehattan raiders continue to be a nuisance to anypony who move through that region.

MSR_Securing_Tenpony:0 "Securing Tenpony"
MSR_Securing_Tenpony_desc:0 "Tenpony is the pride and jewel of the Manehattan ruins. It has stood strong for over 200 years, housing those who have the caps to pay; in luxury that isn't seen anywhere else. However, what many don't know, is that Tenpony also houses a large stockpile of technology that once belonged to the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. Now with Tenpony under our control, we can begin to crack open those vaults."

MSR_Retaking_the_East:0 "Retaking the East"
MSR_Retaking_the_East_desc:0 "There may not be a lot to the east of us, but that doesn't mean that they are entirely useless. There are still some resources we could gain from controlling that territory, not to mention the old dockyards."

MSR_Clearing_Arbu:0 "Clearing Arbu"
MSR_Clearing_Arbu_desc:0 "Arbu surprisingly tried to fight back against my sudden takeover; something I did not expect from them. They seemed like they were trying to hide something from us, but we haven't figured out what. Our best guess is that they might have some technology that they don't want us to have. I'll be sure to have some knights search every inch of that settlement once we clean up the last of the resistance."

MSR_Controlling_Ports:0 "Controlling the Ports"
MSR_Controlling_Ports_desc:0 "Portshoof may not seem like such a strategic location to others, but I know better. The old Manehattan drydocks hold many secrets within them, especially since Equestria's Eastern fleet called them home. Maybe we will even get lucky and find a still intact warship. One can only hope."

MSR_Rebuilding_Dockyards:0 "Rebuilding the Dockyards"
MSR_Rebuilding_Dockyards_desc:0 "The Manehattan dockyards were once a bustling center of trade, shipping a plethora of goods to various locations. Now they are just another scrap heap in the ruins of the city. However, using some of our newly gained resources, we could attempt to get these docks back into working order. This could prove beneficial if we wish to increase our ability to trade, or even decide to build a navy of our own."

MSR_A_Wealth_Technology:0 "A Wealth of Technology"
MSR_A_Wealth_Technology_desc:0 "Ever since I completed my goal of becoming one with technology, the Steel Rangers have become more than I imagined. Not only have we had a territorial increase of well beyond 1000%, but we have increased out tech stockpiles way beyond their capacity. Never have I been prouder to see our mission come to pass. This is truly a great era for the Steel Rangers."

MSR_A_New_City_Rises:0 "A New City Rises"
MSR_A_New_City_Rises_desc:0 "I may have been called crazy in the past, but there is no doubt that I have brought greatness to the Steel Rangers. For the first time in 200 years, the entire city of Manehattan is under the control of a single faction. With the cities combined resources I could not just rebuild Bucklyn Cross, but the entire city of Manehattan. It may be a costly endeavor to take on, but it would also cement the Steel Ranger name into history, forever."

MSR_Testing_The_Waters_F:0 "Testing the Waters"

MSR_Call_Back_Teams_desc:0 "With so many issues on the home front, the Council doesn't think it is wise to continue sending out scavenging teams. So, it has been decided that we will be ceasing all outside scavenging operations; at least until things settle down."

MSR_Secure_Our_Ass:0 "Secure Our Assets"
MSR_Secure_Our_Ass_desc:0 "With so many stockpiles of technology within our territory, we need to make sure that they are all accounted for. We can't afford losing anything from them, as that could cause problems for us in the future."

MSR_Geat_Head_Count_desc:0 "With so many Steel Rangers working outside Bucklyn Cross, we need to ensure that each of them has heeded our call to return. If any Ranger is missing, we must figure out where they have gone to and bring them back."

MSR_Limit_Outside_Operation:0 "Limit Outside Operations"
MSR_Limit_Outside_Operation_desc:0 "We can't fully cut ourselves off, as we still have missions to conduct and resources to gather. So, we will limit outside operations to only those that the Council deems necessary."

MSR_Deal_With_The_Traitors:0 "Deal With the 'Traitors'"
MSR_Deal_With_The_Traitors_desc:0 "The idea that our Elder was using dark magic to achieve immortality within a machine, is knowledge that the council does not want to get out. Because of this, it has been decided that we will label anypony who had intimate knowledge of the Elders plans as 'traitors', and deal with them immediately."

MSR_Reinforce_Old_Ways:0 "Reinforce the Old Ways"
MSR_Reinforce_Old_Ways_desc:0 "Due to the Elders obsession with his project, we had begun to stray from our mission. If we wish to regain any of our lost honor, we must reinforce the old ways by any means necessary."

MSR_Purge_Any_Opposition:0 "Purge Any Opposition"
MSR_Purge_Any_Opposition_desc:0 "We must ensure that the Manehattan Steel Rangers are united as one. Because of this, we will have to rid ourselves of anypony who doesn't fully agree with what we are doing."

MSR_Enforce_Lock_Down:0 "Enforce Lockdown Protocol"
MSR_Enforce_Lock_Down_desc:0 "Our enemies hunt us like animals; if we wish to protect ourselves, we must hide. Enacting the lockdown protocol will ensure that our enemies can't find us and our rangers stay say. It will be tough to endure, but we do this for the greater good on out contingent."

MSR_Evaluate_Our_Contingent:0 "Evaluate Our Contingent"
MSR_Evaluate_Our_Contingent_desc:0 "This contingent has been through a lot in the past couple of weeks. The Council has deemed it necessary to evaluate the contingent to make sure that we are still up to Steel Ranger Standards."

MSR_Cease_Outsider_Recruitment:0 "Cease Outsider Recruitment"
MSR_Cease_Outsider_Recruitment_desc:0 "It is hard to say if we can really trust any of these outsiders. With no way to truly pinpoint exactly who these ponies are or where they came from, the Council has decided that it would be best to cease all outside recruitment until 'further notice'."

MSR_Dissuade_Outside_Contact:0 "Dissuade Outside Contact"
MSR_Dissuade_Outside_Contact_desc:0 "Many of these outsiders carry diseases, leech off our limited resources, or have ulterior motives.

### River Autumn Intro - Deposime Path ###
MSR_River:0 "River Autumn Becomes Elder?"
MSR_River_desc:0 "The provisional council has gone quiet. No one knows what has happened to them, but some are beginning to worry. That worry only increases when the sound of energy weapons can be heard from the Elders quarters."

MSR_The_New_Dev:0 "The New Elder"
MSR_The_New_Dev_desc:0 "As much as River Autumn wanted to dance on the ashes of her former Elder, she knew she couldn't celebrate just yet. There was still a long way to go before she could truly claim victory and declaring herself Elder was only the first step."

MSR_Secure_Our_Tech:0 "Secure our Tech"
MSR_Secure_Our_Tech_desc:0 "Over the past couple of months, my co-conspirators and I have been diligent enough to stash away a large quantity of valuable technology. If we want to be able to keep the momentum going, we must secure these stashes."

MSR_Seize_The_Memes:0 "Seize the Means of Production"

MSR_Storm_The_Armory_desc:0 "With my troops ready to go, we can now begin our final push towards the armory. If we can secure its contents before they seal it off, nothing will stand in our way of achieving victory."

MSR_Gather_The_Rangers:0 "Gather the Rangers"
MSR_Gather_The_Rangers_desc:0 "Going to convince those within the lower ranks to join with me it not as hard as one may think. The hard part, is making them believe that I was in the right to kill the former Elder and take his place."

MSR_Secure_Loyalty:0 "Secure Paladin Loyalty"
MSR_Secure_Loyalty_desc:0 "The Paladins are a fierce bunch of warriors who are completely devoted to the Steel Ranger cause. And as much as it would be easy to just kill them, convincing a few to join me could help legitimize my position even more."

MSR_Dissent:0 "Deal with Dissent"
MSR_Dissent_desc:0 "It is disheartening to see that there are still some who still see me as a murderer who took power for personal gain. And as much as they are correct, I would prefer that they didn't voice their opinions so openly."

MSR_Night_Of_Long_Knives:0 "Night of Long Knives"
MSR_Night_Of_Long_Knives_desc:0 "It is a shame to waste such good talent, but then again, I never fully trusted any of them. In the end, this is just another chore I am going to have to deal with before reaching my end goal."

MSR_Thorn_In_My_Side_desc:0 "Though my power continues to grow each day, one persistent stallion keeps attempting to stop me.

MSR_Steel_Rangers_No_More:0 "Steel Rangers No More"
MSR_Steel_Rangers_No_More_desc:0 "With power now firmly in my hooves, I can finally do away with the Steel Rangers.

MSR_A_Nation_Reborn:0 "A Nation Reborn"

MSR_Giving_Out_Aid:0 "Giving Out Aid"
MSR_Giving_Out_Aid_desc:0 "In order to help secure our legitimacy of the New Equestrian Enclave within the wasteland, we need to start improving our nations image.

MSR_Outlaw_Slavery:0 "Outlaw Slavery"
MSR_Outlaw_Slavery_desc:0 "It seems one of the easiest ways to garner large swaths of support within the wasteland it to become a so called 'liberator of the oppressed'.

MSR_Healthcare_For_All:0 "Healthcare for All"
MSR_Healthcare_For_All_desc:0 "Free healthcare may seem like a giant waste of resources to almost anypony with half a brain, but I say otherwise.

MSR_Project_Purity:0 "Project Purity"
MSR_Project_Purity_desc:0 "I have been told on numerous occasions that this will be a massive waste of resources.

MSR_New_Construction_Methods:0 "New Construction Methods"
MSR_New_Construction_Methods_desc:0 "The Great War destroyed many old-world ideas; one of which being standardized construction methods.

MSR_Rebuild_The_Roads:0 "Rebuilding the Roads"
MSR_Rebuild_The_Roads_desc:0 "Roads are the veins of any function society; allowing vital supplies to quickly move around. And though all of Equestria's original roads are now rot with wear and tear, we now have ample supplies to begin both repairing the old roads and building new ones."

MSR_Standardize_Production:0 "Standardize Production"
MSR_Standardize_Production_desc:0 "For too long we have been reliant on any old-world equipment we could get out hooves on.

MSR_Create_New_Labor_Laws:0 "Create New Labor Laws"
MSR_Create_New_Labor_Laws_desc:0 "I believe that ensuring the rights of every working pony is essential to our nation's survival.

MSR_Industrial_Hearland_Reborn:0 "Industrial Heartland Reborn"
MSR_Industrial_Hearland_Reborn_desc:0 "Not in the past 200 years, has a nation become such a powerhouse within the ruins of Manehattan. Our economy has reached that of a small pre-war country, while our position within the wasteland has grown far beyond what even the Steel Rangers could dream of. If we can keep this momentum going, we could soon begin to rival the likes of Red Eye and his Slavers."

MSR_Expanding_Our_Borders:0 "Expanding Our Borders"
MSR_Expanding_Our_Borders_desc:0 "Our current position is pitiful. We are trapped within the ruins of Bucklyn with barely any room to stand, while struggling daily to gather enough recourses to get by.

MSR_Sacking_The_Empire:0 "Sacking the Empire"
MSR_Sacking_The_Empire_desc:0 "The Empire has sat comfortably against our north-western border for quite some time now. Their vast swaths of land and resources silently mocking us. I think it is time we march into their lands and take what should rightfully be ours."

MSR_Clearing_Out_Cannibals_desc:0 "I've been getting reports that there might be cannibals within the settlement of Arbu. Such an abominable thing to even consider and I would hope that these rumors aren't true. However, if they are, then I think we just gained a solid excuse to send the troops in."

MSR_Pushing_Towards_Portshoof:0 "Pushing Towards Portshoof"
MSR_Pushing_Towards_Portshoof_desc:0 "Portshoof has become quite the center for trade. The vast amount of resources moving in and out of their markets is quite impressive. Such a shame that we will be confiscating it all."

MSR_Taking_Stable_29:0 "Taking Stable 29"
MSR_Taking_Stable_29_desc:0 "Stable 29 has always been of a place of great interest to the Steel Rangers, especially to Elder Cottage Cheese. If I wish to find out what was keeping the late Elder up every night, I will have to also deal with the Raiders the occupy the area around it."

MSR_Crossing_Into_Marelem:0 "Crossing into Marelem"
MSR_Crossing_Into_Marelem_desc:0 "Marelem sits right across the pond from us, quietly waiting for somepony to aid them against their raider neighbors. Well, that day has come, as the New Equestrian Enclave will gladly stand up and protect them. As long as they submit to us."

MSR_Dinner_In_Tenpony:0 "Dinner at Tenpony"
MSR_Dinner_In_Tenpony_desc:0 "Tenpony is quite a sight to see in the wasteland. And with how much they have to offer for those that can afford it, annexing them could provide quite a nice place for me to dine along with fellow officers and politicians."

MSR_Moving_To_End_Friendship:0 "Moving to End Friendship"
MSR_Moving_To_End_Friendship_desc:0 "Friendship City has always served as a safe haven for those that wish to try and escape the horrors of the wasteland. And as much as I admire what they are doing to help those in need, I also don't like seeing others trying to outdo my work."

MSR_Eastward_Expansion:0 "Eastward Expansion"

MSR_March_Along_the_Coast:0 "Shadow over Sunrise"
MSR_March_Along_the_Coast_desc:0 "The Sunrise region of the Equestrian Wasteland is home a number of varying nations who claim ownership of its lands. Such a pity that none of these nations know that, I too, lay claim to their lands."

MSR_Send_in_The_Peace_Keepers:0 "Send in the Peace Keepers"
MSR_Send_in_The_Peace_Keepers_desc:0 "It seems like not everypony appreciates being told that they are now part of the New Equestrian Enclave. That they will no longer have to worry about barely scrapping by, as we will be there to ensure their continued survival. Well, if they want to speak out against all the good things we are doing for them, then I will just have to show them how I deal with dissent."

MSR_Stirring_Up_Trouble:0 "Stirring Up Trouble"
MSR_Stirring_Up_Trouble_desc:0 "It seems like a new threat has begun to rub against our borders. This stallion, Red Eye, and his army of slavers are possibly the biggest threat we have ever seen. This will be our greatest challenge yet and we must use every advantage we can get if we hope to defeat them. Lucky for us, I think I have an idea."

MSR_Ending_Red_Eyes_Reign:0 "Ending Red Eye's Reign"
MSR_Ending_Red_Eyes_Reign_desc:0 "With our forces now in position and the rebels now properly armed, it is time to bring an end to Red Eye's parade. If we can win this war, nothing will stand in my way of achieving greatness."

MSR_Freeing_the_Enslaved_desc:0 "As I drive around Red Eye's former territories, I am greeted by the cheers and admiration of his former slaves. They view me as their hero in the wastes; a messiah sent to free them from their shackles. It fills my heart knowing that they think that they are truly free under my rule. But I won't say anything, as I would hate to spoil their fun."

MSR_Meeting_Old_Friends:0 "Meeting Old Friends"
MSR_Meeting_Old_Friends_desc:0 "It seems that the Fillydelphia Steel Rangers have managed to remain alive, even after all that has happened around them. Maybe I should go and pay them a visit, just to see how they are doing."

MSR_Retaking_the_Heartland:0 "Retaking the Heartland"
MSR_Retaking_the_Heartland_desc:0 "The New Equestrian Enclave stands on top; no other nation dares to threaten us. Our recent territorial gains have given us vast quantities of resources and ponypower which help to further my goals. With our position in the wasteland better than ever before, it is time to for us to move to the final stage of my ultimate plan. Retaking all of Equestria."

MSR_A_New_Equestrian_Army:0 "A New Equestrian Army"
MSR_A_New_Equestrian_Army_desc:0 "My forces are currently poorly organized, under trained, and barely disciplined. My only saving grace being that the majority of them are former Steel Ranger veterans. If we want to be able to stand hoof to hoof with those around us, I am going to have to reorganize my forces into a proper army."

MSR_A_Organized_Army:0 "An Organized Army"
MSR_A_Organized_Army_desc:0 "A well organized and well-equipped army stands above all who face it. Making sure every soldier has a proper rifle and equipment should be our top priority in the face of war."

MSR_Infantry_Support_Weapons:0 "Infantry Support Weapons"
MSR_Infantry_Support_Weapons_desc:0 "It would be wise to make sure that each of our divisions are properly supported. From medics to machine guns; maintenance to artillery. These Combat Support and Combat Service Support teams will be crucial in making sure our soldiers can stay in the fight."

MSR_Raining_Fire:0 "Raining Fire"
MSR_Raining_Fire_desc:0 "Thanks to our ever-expanding industrial base, we have begun the production of new Artillery guns that will surely turn the tables in our favor.

MSR_An_Highly_Mobile_Army:0 "A Highly Mobile Army"
MSR_An_Highly_Mobile_Army_desc:0 "A force that is quick enough to react to any situation is crucial to waging was in the wasteland. These motorized units will be able to outpace and foot soldier while still maintaining combat effectiveness."

MSR_Putting_Guns_On_Trucks:0 "Putting Guns on Trucks"
MSR_Putting_Guns_On_Trucks_desc:0 "Some of our soldiers have decided to add steel plates and heavy machine guns to some of the old trucks we have been repairing. At first it seemed like a waste of resources, but after reading about how well they have performed, I think it is time I gave them another look."

MSR_Beasts_of_Steel:0 "Beasts of Steel"
MSR_Beasts_of_Steel_desc:0 "Tanks were once considered to be an essential part of modern warfare, but thanks to the Great War, they are nothing more that massive scrap heaps. However, now that our industrial base has grown quite a considerable size, we could bring life back into these steel beasts."

MSR_Hiring_New_Generals:0 "Hiring New Generals"
MSR_Hiring_New_Generals_desc:0 "Thanks to those little purges of mine, we are entirely lacking a competent command staff.

MSR_Office_of_Internal_Integrity_desc:0 "There will always be those who wish to speak out against, protest against, or even attempt to overthrow me.

MSR_Keeping_the_Peace:0 "Keeping the Peace"
MSR_Keeping_the_Peace_desc:0 "With threats looming around every corner, trying to ensure that peace is maintained within the state is going to be difficult to achieve. So, to remedy this, a specialized unit of enforces has been created to deal with any major threat thrown their way. These 'Peacekeepers' will become the spearhead for the New Equestrian Enclave military; installing fear into those who get in their way."

MSR_Service_Gurantees_Citizenship:0 "Service Guarantee's Citizenship"
MSR_Service_Gurantees_Citizenship_desc:0 "We can't just have anypony be considered a citizen of the New Equestrian Enclave; we only want the best. And only through serving the needs of the state could one even fathom the idea of becoming a citizen. Because, becoming a citizen should be considered a privilege and never something taken for granted."

MSR_Deployment_Groups:0 "Deployment Groups"
MSR_Deployment_Groups_desc:0 "As much as I resented how much the Steel Rangers worshiped power armor, you can't ignore how useful it is in combat.

MSR_Going_In_Guns_Blazing:0 "Going in Guns Blazing"
MSR_Going_In_Guns_Blazing_desc:0 "Power armor leaves little in the way of conducting operations behind enemy lines. The best we can do is have the units show up at a strategic location and start gunning down anything that moves.

MSR_Vertibuck_Assault_Teams:0 "Vertibuck Assault Teams"
MSR_Vertibuck_Assault_Teams_desc:0 "To help increase the effectiveness of our Deployment Groups, we have allotted them the use of some of our recently built Vertibucks.

MSR_Special_Intervention_Force:0 "Special Intervention Force"
MSR_Special_Intervention_Force_desc:0 "Power armor may make you a walking tank, but when it comes to conducting special or covert operations, it is pretty much useless. What we need instead, are specially designated, organized, trained, and equipped forces, who can use unconventional means to wage war against our enemies."

MSR_Asymmetric_Warfare:0 "Asymmetric Warfare"
MSR_Asymmetric_Warfare_desc:0 "The Special Intervention Force knows that no amount of training or top of the line equipment will save them if they get into a fierce firefight.

MSR_Long_Range_Wasteland_Group:0 "Long Range Wasteland Group"
MSR_Long_Range_Wasteland_Group_desc:0 "Conducting operations outside our borders is in no way an easy task. These long-range special operations units will do everything within their power to make sure that any outside threat to this nation is swiftly dealt with.

MSR_Army_of_Freedom:0 "Army of 'Freedom'"
MSR_Army_of_Freedom_desc:0 "Never before has a military force of such standing professionalism been seen within the wasteland in over 200 years.

MSR_Hooves:0 "Steel Hooves Becomes Elder"
MSR_Hooves_desc:0 "The provisional council has chosen Steel Hooves as the new Elder of the Manehattan Contingent. Many of the contingent is surprised by this, but some are hopeful that he will lead them into a brighter tomorrow."

MSR_Hold_Speech:0 "Hold a Speech"
MSR_Hold_Speech_desc:0 "I am not one to give speeches, but I was told this might help to ease some of the tension building up. Let's just hope I don't mess this one up."

MSR_Talk_With_Paladins:0 "Talk with the Paladins"
MSR_Talk_With_Paladins_desc:0 "Many of the Paladins within this contingent weren't too happy when they heard that I was chosen as their next Elder. I think it would be wise to talk with them before they do something brash."

MSR_Meet_With_Scribes:0 "Meet with the Scribes"
MSR_Meet_With_Scribes_desc:0 "The scribes have always been partial to the politics of the Steel Rangers; focusing more on their work than what's going on around them. If I could convince them to support me, it could help in legitimizing my position."

MSR_Exile_Extremists:0 "Exile the Extremists"
MSR_Exile_Extremists_desc:0 "The Steel Rangers has always been home to a number of unsavory characters; ones who would rather do as they please without interference. I can't allow these types within our ranks and know that we must rid ourselves of them before they attempt to push back. It will be tough to let so many Rangers go, but it must be done if we wish to change who we are."

MSR_Rid_The_Old_Ways:0 "Rid of the Old Ways"
MSR_Rid_The_Old_Ways_desc:0 "The old ways have held us back for a long time; preventing us from becoming something more. From our distrust of outsiders, to our complete obsession with technology. It is time we rid ourselves of these ideals and look towards something new."

MSR_Rally_The_Rangers:0 "Rally the Steel Rangers"
MSR_Rally_The_Rangers_desc:0 "With the majority of the Manehattan contingent on my side, it is time we rally them to our cause; only then can we begin to bring change to the Steel Rangers. The road ahead is going to be a tough one and there will be many obstacles in our way. But if we stand united, we shall endure anything that comes our way."

MSR_Break_The_Chains:0 "Break the Chains"
MSR_Break_The_Chains_desc:0 "The 'Chain That Binds' is something that only brought more harm than good, when in it was implemented. My years in the military showed me that a flexible command structure works more efficiently than one that is rigid."

MSR_Change_Our_Approach:0 "Change our Approach"
MSR_Change_Our_Approach_desc:0 "Whenever we dealt with any kind of situation our approach always seemed to barge in and do as we please. I think it is time we find a more diplomatic approach to solving an issue and only start barging in when that option has truly failed."

MSR_Our_Original_Mission:0 "Our Original Mission"
MSR_Our_Original_Mission_desc:0 "We turned away almost any outsider who begged for our help, because they weren't one of us. We refused to shelter those who needed protection, leaving them to fend for themselves. I say, no more. For the first time in almost 200 years, we shall cast aside what made us who we are and find a new purpose in life. From this day forth, we shall dedicate ourselves to our original mission; protecting the ponies of Equestria from those who wish to do them harm."

### Steel Hooves Route ###

MSR_Steel_Rangers_Reborn:0 "Steel Rangers Reborn"
MSR_Steel_Rangers_Reborn_desc:0 "If we wish to try and distance ourselves from the Steel Rangers, we must come up with a new name for ourselves. I believe I have an idea that will not only honor our oaths to Equestria, but the mare that helped to create us."

MSR_Allow_More_Outsiders:0 "Allow More Outsiders"
MSR_Allow_More_Outsiders_desc:0 "There have been many ponies that have come to us eager to join, only for us to turn them away because of our policies against outsiders. However, after talking to some of the members of this contingent, I have found it not necessary to continue this policy. From now on, we will allow any able-bodied ponies into our ranks as fully fledged members of the Applejack Rangers."

MSR_Open_Up_Outside_Relations:0 "Open Up Outside Relations"
MSR_Open_Up_Outside_Relations_desc:0 "We have isolated ourselves for too long and the strain on resources is beginning to show itself. It would be a good idea to begin opening up relations with outside settlements if we wish to survive. We need to get the ball rolling on this, as it may take some time for settlements to agree to the idea of trading with us."

MSR_Increase_Patrols:0 "Increase Patrols"
MSR_Increase_Patrols_desc:0 "Before, patrol groups only patrolled the area immediately around Bucklyn Cross. I think it would be wise to not only increase the number of patrols we have, but also extend the area in which they patrol. This would allow us to better deter raider attacks, while also showing the local wastelanders that we are there to protect them."

MSR_Protecting_Wastelanders:0 "Protecting Wastelanders"
MSR_Protecting_Wastelanders_desc:0 "It seems our work is starting to pay off. Ponies in, and around, the Bucklyn area have begun to thank us for our service to them. With this initial success, I feel it is a good time to begin having groups of Rangers begin actively helping any wastelander that is moving through our territory. Hopefully this will continue to show outsiders that we can be trusted."

MSR_Support_Local_Settlement:0 "Support Local Settlements"
MSR_Support_Local_Settlement_desc:0 "With the success we are seeing in helping those within our territorial borders, many nearby settlements have asked us to help support them against possible raids. I didn't expect them to reach out to us so quickly, but that doesn't mean it is a bad thing. I am just happy that they are starting to see us as a group to seek help from."

MSR_Incentivize_Trade:0 "Incentivize Trade"
MSR_Incentivize_Trade_desc:0 "Trade talks have begun, but are moving at a snail's pace. Nearby settlements are still unwilling to conduct major trade with us, as they feel we really don't have much to offer them. Because of this, I have authorized that we allow the trade of some of our nonessential tech for these much-needed resources."

MSR_Support_Local_Caravans:0 "Support Local Caravans"
MSR_Support_Local_Caravans_desc:0 "With trade now starting to grow between us and a number of outside settlements. It would be wise to start giving out support for some of the caravans that help us conduct our business. If we show them how much we appreciate their work, they will be more likely to continue working with us."

MSR_Become_A_Force_For_Good:0 "Becoming a Force for Good"
MSR_Become_A_Force_For_Good_desc:0 "It is high time we truly show the wasteland that we are a force for good. No longer will we bring unwarranted harm to those who peacefully cross our paths. From here on out, we will strive to show the wasteland that there is still good within the heart of every Equestrian."

MSR_A_Fork_In_The_Road:0 "A Fork in the Road"
MSR_A_Fork_In_The_Road_desc:0 "Even though so much good has been done by the Applejack Rangers, there is still a lot of work to do. However, I am unsure if I want to continue doing all this work; I need some time to think."

MSR_Manehattan_Treaty_Organization:0 "Manehattan Treaty Organization"
MSR_Manehattan_Treaty_Organization_desc:0 "With how harsh the Equestrian Wasteland can be, the idea of a multi-settlement treaty organization centered within ruin of Manehattan could benefit many. With this type of treaty organization, we could ensure both military and economic cooperation with those who wish to join. It won't be easy to create, but with enough time it could bring stability to this region."

MSR_Offer_Membership_To_Others:0 "Offer Membership to Others"
MSR_Offer_Membership_To_Others_desc:0 "With the charter drafter and the paperwork almost complete, it is now time to move to the next step of this plan. We will send out a number of evnoys to some of the surrounding settlements, asking if they wish to join the MTO. Hopefully we can gain a few new member-settlements."

MSR_Create_A_Mutual_Defense_Pact:0 "Create a Mutual Defense Pact"
MSR_Create_A_Mutual_Defense_Pact_desc:0 "Now that we have a number of member-settlement in the MTO now, it is time to gather the representatives of each settlement and start getting to work. Our first order of business is to ensure that each settlement is ready in the event that another member-state is attacked. Because if one state is attacked, all states are attacked."

MSR_Joint_Military_Exercises:0 "Joint Military Exercises"
MSR_Joint_Military_Exercises_desc:0 "In order to make sure that each settlement is ready for the event of a sudden attack, we have devised a number of joint military exercises to be conducted. It will be hard on them at first, as many of these settlements have never had anything more than a militia force to protect them. But by the time we are done, those militia forces will come ready to face anything."

MSR_Aid_In_Re_Industrialization:0 "Aid in Re-industrialization"
MSR_Aid_In_Re_Industrialization_desc:0 "Helping to build industry within each member-settlement is big factor in ensuring their survival. So, we have agreed to lend a number of our scribes out to help the settlements understand what it will take to create an industrial base from scratch."

MSR_Manehattan_Recovery_Program:0 "Manehattan Recovery Program"
MSR_Manehattan_Recovery_Program_desc:0 "The survival of each member-settlement is key to the survival of the MTO as a whole. Because of this, we have decided to lend whatever resources we can spare to every member-settlement. It may put a strain on our resources for some time, but it will do much good for all of us in the long run."

MSR_Keeping_The_Flame:0 "Keeping the Flame"
MSR_Keeping_The_Flame_desc:0 "There is still so much that can be done to improve the situation within Manehattan. I can't stop, won't stop until I ensure that the safety of all who live here is guaranteed."

MSR_Carrying_On_A_Memory:0 "Carrying on a Memory"
MSR_Carrying_On_A_Memory_desc:0 "Though Applejack is all but a memory for me now, her dream of helping those in need still reside within me. I never realized the good we could have done if we followed her example instead of hiding away. It is time we carry that dream in honor of her, so that its message can be seen by all of the Equestrian Wasteland."

MSR_Talk_With_Crossroads:0 "Talk with Crossroads"
MSR_Talk_With_Crossroads_desc:0 "Crossroads has been very vocal about her animosity towards some of the decisions I have made. She says that the Applejack Rangers are changing too rapidly, causing us to alienate many former Rangers. I understand her concerns, but I know I will have to talk with her in the hopes of making her realize that costs that come with change."

MSR_Remember_Our_Oaths:0 "Remember Our Oaths"
MSR_Remember_Our_Oaths_desc:0 "When the Steel Rangers were first created, we all took an oath; one that stated that we would protect and defend Equestria and its citizens. Since the Great War, that oath has been lost to time; replaced with a more twisted version. For too long we have followed this false oath and it is high time we rid ourselves of it and return to our roots. It is time we remember our oaths to Equestria and, once again, swear to protect her. Even in her darkest hour."

MSR_Embracing_Outsiders:0 "Embracing Outsiders"
MSR_Embracing_Outsiders_desc:0 "We have had outsiders within our ranks for some time now, but it seems like there are still some who hold animosity towards them. It is shameful to see so called 'Brothers in Hooves' distrust one another and put their lives in possible jeopardy. We must show them that these outsiders are not only to be trusted, but embraced, as if they were an old friend."

MSR_The_Spirit_Of_Honesty:0 "The Spirit of Honesty"
MSR_The_Spirit_Of_Honesty_desc:0 "Applejack represented the spirit of honesty as she was always willing to tell the truth, no matter what. She went above and beyond to help, not just her friends, but anypony that needed help. If we want to continue to show the wasteland that the Applejack Rangers are their friends, we must strive to follow her example."

MSR_An_Unwavering_Vision:0 "An Unwavering Vision"
MSR_An_Unwavering_Vision_desc:0 "We have come so far in the past couple of years, more than I thought we ever would. Our fledgling organization, built from the ashes of the Steel Rangers, has become a beacon of hope within the wasteland. No more will the ponies of the wasteland be fearful of what may lay around the corner, as we will be there to help them along the way. There is a long road ahead of us, but I believe that if we stray true to our vision, nothing will stand in our way."

MSR_Investigate_Arbu:0 "Investigate Arbu"
MSR_Investigate_Arbu_desc:0 "Some of our scouts have begun noticing strange things happening at Arbu. Let's hope their post-op reports can shed some light on the situation."

MSR_Take_Out_The_Empire:0 "Take Out the Empire"
MSR_Take_Out_The_Empire_desc:0 "The Empires power within the Manhattan region has been growing for quite some time. Their forces lining against our borders; threatening our sovereignty. Because of this, we had put plans in place to preemptively strike their positions with the hopes of taking their forces out in one fell swoop."

MSR_Crush_The_Manehattan_Raiders:0 "Crush the Manehattan Raiders"
MSR_Crush_The_Manehattan_Raiders_desc:0 "The Manhattan Raiders have been a threat in the region to too long. Their blatant disregard for pony life is something we won't stand for. It is high time that the swift hoof of justice is brought down on them and their reign of terror ended."

MSR_Deal_With_The_Rain_Raiders:0 "Deal with the Rain Raiders"
MSR_Deal_With_The_Rain_Raiders_desc:0 "The Rain Raiders continue to be a threat to anypony traveling within the area. If we wish to ensure the safety of all travelers coming to the Manehattan ruins, we will have to take them out for good."

MSR_Passing_The_Torch:0 "Passing the Torch"
MSR_Passing_The_Torch_desc:0 "It was unexpected to say the least; I never thought I would even be considered for elder. But with how fast thing are changing around here, some are looking towards as a voice of reason. It will be tough task to endure, but hopefully by then end of it, I can bring some balance back to the Applejack Rangers."

MSR_Necessary_Compromise:0 "Necessary Compromise"
MSR_Necessary_Compromise_desc:0 "Steel Hooves may have initially had the right idea; working to make the Steel Rangers a force for good. But he tried to change too many things too quickly, causing rifts to form within our ranks. If we wish to keep ourselves from collapsing, I need to make some compromises to appease the more hardline groups."

MSR_Realism_Not_Idealism:0 "Realism, Not Idealism"
MSR_Realism_Not_Idealism_desc:0 "Steel Hooves was so focused on changing the Steel Rangers into something new, that he lost sight of what was going on in front of him. His new policies were pushing away many of his former supporters while forcing us to give up more of our resources. Though his intentions were noble, they were in no way grounded in reality."

MSR_Remember_Our_Mission:0 "Remember Our Mission"
MSR_Remember_Our_Mission_desc:0 "We cannot hold ourselves to such old-world ideas. As much as our oaths still hold meaning to our cause, they also have us swear loyalty for a nation that does not exist anymore. The only thing we can hold ourselves too now is collecting and securing harmful technology from those who wish to use it for malice."

MSR_Bring_Back_The_Outcasts:0 "Bring Back the Outcasts"
MSR_Bring_Back_The_Outcasts_desc:0 "When Steel Hooves began reforming the Steel Rangers into the Applejack Rangers, he forced a large number of non-supporters out. In doing this, we lost a lot of ponies with both valuable skill and equipment. I feel that Steel Hooves was too harsh on some of them and that we should allow some of them to return."

MSR_The_Supremacy_Of_Steel:0 "The Supremacy of Steel"
MSR_The_Supremacy_Of_Steel_desc:0 "The Equestrian Wasteland is unforgiving and steel, not honesty, is the best policy within the wasteland. It takes more than sharing your true emotions to survive; you need guts, grits, and a lot of guns. We are called the Steel Rangers for a reason, and it wasn't because we shared our feelings with each other."

MSR_A_Reasonable_View:0 "A Reasonable View"
MSR_A_Reasonable_View_desc:0 "Steel Hooves thought that he could bring forth change in a matter of weeks, but all it did was divide us even more. If I not had been chosen to be Elder when I did, the Applejack Rangers would not have lasted more than a year. I may not have been as idealistic as Steel Hooves was, but I have still set the Applejack Rangers on the right path."

MSR_Bucklyn_Defense_Initiative:0 "Bucklyn Defense Initiative"
MSR_Bucklyn_Defense_Initiative_desc:0 "The need to protect ourselves is great, but something we can't do alone. Even with all the changes we have enacted, we are still not the most liked group within the wasteland. I think it is high time we create some kind of defense initiative to make sure that safety of Bucklyn is ensured."

MSR_Convince_Others_To_Join:0 "Convince Others to Join"
MSR_Convince_Others_To_Join_desc:0 "In order for this initiative to succeed, we need other settlements to act as buffer states for us. But that requires them to willingly joins us; something the other settlements might not agree too. So, to remedy that, we'll make sure that that don't have much of a choice in the matter."

MSR_Offer_Military_Protection:0 "'Offer' Military Protection"
MSR_Offer_Military_Protection_desc:0 "Now that we were able to 'convince' all of these settlements to join our little defense pact, we can begin to move troops into their territories. This is to ensure that our 'allies' are properly protected from any outside threat. It would be a shame to see them get pushed over by some raider group, now wouldn't it."

MSR_Create_A_Technology_Tax:0 "Create a Technology Tax"
MSR_Create_A_Technology_Tax_desc:0 "With the safety of our 'allies' ensured; we can begin to focus on creating some reforms. Our first order of business is to institute a technology tax within their territories. This is to help compensate for the fact that we are deploying so many of our Rangers outside Bucklyn. It will in no way hurt their economic situation, as long as they comply."

MSR_Seize_Illegal_Technology:0 "Seize 'Illegal' Technology"
MSR_Seize_Illegal_Technology_desc:0 "Seems like some of our 'allies' have been secretly hoarding technology from us. This will not do at all; how are we supposed to trust each other if them do things like this. Looks like I am going to have to send some Rangers in to seize these stockpiles and ensure that our allies don't go behind my back again."

MSR_Occupy_Strategic_Locations:0 "Occupy Strategic Locations"
MSR_Occupy_Strategic_Locations_desc:0 "It has been confirmed that some of our 'allies' have locations of strategic importance within their territories. These locations could prove useful to us given that we are allowed to take them over. It should be a relatively simple task, but we must also be prepared just in case they refuse."

MSR_A_City_In_Ruins:0 "A City in Ruins"
MSR_A_City_In_Ruins_desc:0 "Manehattan was once one of the largest centers of trade and commerce in Equestria. Now, it sits in ruin, slowly wasting away. It's about time somepony changed that. Thanks to our technological know-how and military might, we will begin to rebuild this glorified junk yard into a prosperous community."

MSR_Repairing_Bucklyn_Cross:0 "Repairing Bucklyn Cross"
MSR_Repairing_Bucklyn_Cross_desc:0 "Bucklyn Cross may be our home, but it is also a logistical nightmare. Almost every road in and out of the area is covered by some sort of hazard. If we wish to be able to carry out operations with relative ease, we need to make sure our supply and communication lines are fully open to us."

MSR_Securing_Bucklyn_Proper_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our supply routes within Bucklyn Cross, it would be wise to move towards cleaning up Bucklyn proper. Doing so would allow us to not only expand our area of operation within Manehattan, but also expand our ability to trade."

MSR_Rebuilding_Rail_Lines:0 "Rebuilding the Rail Lines"
MSR_Rebuilding_Rail_Lines_desc:0 "Bucklyn was once home to a system of commuter trains that allowed ponies to move around the city with ease. There is great potential if we could find a way to repair these rails lines. Doing so, would not only increase our ability to move supplies around, but also allow for the rapid deployment of our troops."

MSR_Arms_Salvaging:0 "Arms Salvaging"
MSR_Arms_Salvaging_desc:0 "A Steel Ranger is nothing more than a glorified civilian without their equipment. So, in order to make sure each Steel Ranger is properly armed and equipped, we must increase our efforts in salvaging pre-war military warehouses."

MSR_Hiring_Weaponsmith:0 "Hiring Weaponsmiths"
MSR_Hiring_Weaponsmith_desc:0 "As our military strength continues to grow, so does our need for more equipment. Scavenging isn't going to meet our expanding needs as it once did. So, we have begun hiring weaponsmiths to aid in the production of new equipment."

MSR_Vigilant_Recycling:0 "Vigilant Recycling"
MSR_Vigilant_Recycling_desc:0 "Waste not, want not. From toasters to broken MEW's, every piece of scrap technology can be broken down into useable parts. Making sure we recycle every piece of broken technology we come across, will ensure we never run out of these vital components."

MSR_Foundries_Of_Steel:0 "Foundries of Steel"
MSR_Foundries_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Our military-industrial complex has grown to such a point that not even the weaponsmiths can keep up. So, to remedy this, we have begun converting some of the old factories into centers of arms production. Never again will we have to scavenge the leftovers of the old world for new equipment."

MSR_Metailurgy_Reborn:0 "Metallurgy Reborn"
MSR_Metailurgy_Reborn_desc:0 "As the Steel Rangers continue to grow, so does our need for more advanced metals. Lucky for us, we have been able to find a number of holotapes containing information on the science of metallurgy. Thanks to these, we should be able to produce more refined alloys."

MSR_Stripping_World_Facilities:0 "Stripping Old-World Facilities"
MSR_Stripping_World_Facilities_desc:0 "If we want to be able to produce more advanced equipment, we must maintain a large stockpile of advanced components. However, the only way to do that is by stripping every pre-war government complex and research facility we come across. It will be highly dangerous work, but our need for these parts outweigh those costs."

MSR_Back_Yard_Forages:0 "Back Yard Forges"
MSR_Back_Yard_Forages_desc:0 "If we wish to continue our efforts in rebuilding Manehattan, we need to first build up an industrial base. Though it will start off rather small, given enough time we could soon turn Manehattan back into the industrial center of Equestria."

MSR_Civilian_Labor_Corp:0 "Civilian Labor Corp"
MSR_Civilian_Labor_Corp_desc:0 "There are a number of ponies who have made their way to Manehattan in the hopes of seeking shelter with us. And even though we loath the idea of doing charity work, a number of these ponies hold skills that we are sorely lacking in. Because of this we have begun hiring them on to start doing work that our own scribes could care less about."

MSR_City_Of_Steel:0 "City of Steel"
MSR_City_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Bucklyn, even in the ruined state it is, can still serve a great purpose to us. Many of the old structures were made from a multitude of metals that we could easily reuse for our own benefit. Thanks to this, we are certain we will never run out of scrap to use."

MSR_Rebuilding_Old_Canneries:0 "Repairing the Old Canneries"
MSR_Rebuilding_Old_Canneries_desc:0 "Reconstruction is going slow, but steady. Our industrial base has taken roots which has allowed us to look into expanding it. Lucky for us, there are some old canneries nearby that are still in decent condition. Hopefully with a little TLC, we can get them back into working order."

MSR_Repairing_The_Generators:0 "Repairing the Generators"
MSR_Repairing_The_Generators_desc:0 "Electricity is crucial to our survival. It is what keeps the factories running, the communications flowing, and our weapon systems operating. So, in order to keep up with the ever-increasing demand, we must continue to rebuild and repair any power generator we come across."

MSR_Restoring_Water_Plant:0 "Restoring the Bucklyn Water Plant"
MSR_Restoring_Water_Plant_desc:0 "The Mare River is by no means a safe source of drinking water. Fortunately, Bucklyn just so happens to be home to a rather sizable water treatment facility. With a bit of work, we could have it up and running again in no time."

MSR_Buckyln_Reborn:0 "Bucklyn Reborn"
MSR_Buckyln_Reborn_desc:0 "It has taken us quite some time, but it was worth all of the hardships. Thanks to the efforts of every Steel Ranger and wasteland volunteer, the once desolate ruins of Bucklyn have been transformed into a thriving community. No longer are we hiding away in Bucklyn Cross, fearful of what lay in the ruins. No longer are we barely managing to scrape together enough supplies to get by on. Our factories produce new equipment for us, while our repaired roads allow for ease of trade with the outside. The industrial might of Equestria is waking once more, and the Steel Rangers shall be there to guide it every step of the way."

### Army Tree ###

MSR_Army_Reorganization:0 "Army Reorganization"
MSR_Army_Reorganization_desc:0 "Thanks to all the political infighting, our armed forces have become somewhat neglected over the past years. This is something we cannot allow. We must reorganize and reevaluate our forces if we hope to still be able to put up a fight."

MSR_Combat_Log:0 "Pre-War Combat Logs"
MSR_Combat_Log_desc:0 "A wise pony once said that "if one wants to define the future, they must study the past.". And study the past we shall. Our vast collection of pre-war combat logs provides us with valuable information involving numerous types of military engagements. With these logs, we can better understand what the militaries of the past did right and what they did wrong. From there, we should be able to formulate new plans that better fit the battlefields of today."

MSR_Raider_Wars:0 "Raider Wars"
MSR_Raider_Wars_desc:0 "Given our plethora resources and weapons, we are a prime target for raider factions. Though some of these wars have been costly, they have given us valuable amounts of combat logs that we can review. With each new combat log, we can come up better plans and tactics to use against these varying groups."

MSR_Combat_Simulation:0 "Combat Simulations"
MSR_Combat_Simulation_desc:0 "Though it will never be as good as experiencing a battle firsthoof, the use of simulations has been a proven military training tactic since before the Great War. And they can still provide us with the necessary training needed if these certain situations are to arise during combat."

MSR_Reverse_Engineering:0 "Reverse Engineering"
MSR_Reverse_Engineering_desc:0 "Thanks to the hard work of our scribes, we now have a better understanding of our magical energy weapons. Hopefully this will allow us to better streamline our production of them, along with reducing their overall production cost."

MSR_Old_World:0 "Old World Efficiency"
MSR_Old_World_desc:0 "Why try to fix something if it isn't broken? That's the thought when it comes to whether we should upgrade our magical energy weapons. We have been using the same MEW's for centuries now and they have more than proved themselves reliable."

MSR_New_World:0 "New World Design"
MSR_New_World_desc:0 "Though our MEW's of old have done us well, they are beginning to show their age. Luckily, our scribes have been prototyping an advanced MEW weapon system. This step towards the future is essential to keeping ourselves in the fight, though it does mean we will have to move more resources towards their production."

MSR_Routine_Maintenance:0 "Routine Maintenance"
MSR_Routine_Maintenance_desc:0 "Our power armor is centuries old and could easily breakdown in combat. In trying to prevent this, the scribes have implemented a routine maintenance program for all of our power armor. With this in place, our armor will always be combat ready."

MSR_Streamlined_Parts:0 "Streamlined Parts"
MSR_Streamlined_Parts_desc:0 "Some of the scribes have concluded that we could easily streamline the production of power armor, given enough time. This would greatly increase the number of units we can produce. However, it would also decrease the reliability of the power armor, as well as compromise some of its integrity."

MSR_Reinforced_Alloys:0 "Reinforced Alloys"
MSR_Reinforced_Alloys_desc:0 "Some of the scribes have found a way to reinforce our power armor with a new type of super alloy. With this alloy added into the power armor, the hull integrity would increase significantly, though it would make producing power armor more costly."

MSR_PBF:0 "Pony's Best Friend. Reinvented, again."
MSR_PBF_desc:0 "Robots were once a vital part of the Equestrian war effort. However, many now lie in scrap piles collecting rest. It might be beneficial to start looking into researching them once again, as they could prove a valuable asset."

MSR_Legion_Of_Steel:0 "Legions of Steel"
MSR_Legion_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Robots are nothing more than the perfect cannon fodder. Make their design simple enough and you could field thousands of them. Then all you have to do is sit back and watch them soften up the enemy before sending in the more valuable troops in to clean up."

MSR_Mobile_Weapon_System:0 "Mobile Weapon Systems"
MSR_Mobile_Weapon_System_desc:0 "Robronco had the right idea when creating heavy assault robots like the sentinels. Their increased armor and complement of weaponry more than outweigh their costly production. Having these mobile tanks on our side would give us a massive advantage on the battlefield."

MSR_Promoting_Initiates:0 "Promoting Initiates"
MSR_Promoting_Initiates_desc:0 "With our ponypower reserves starting to falter, we have decided to hasten the promotion of many of our initiates. They may have not fully finished their training, but this influx will hopefully fill in a number of gaps we have. It may not be the most ideal situation, but we don't really have time to argue about that."

MSR_Wasteland_Conscription:0 "Wasteland Conscription"
MSR_Wasteland_Conscription_desc:0 "In order to keep up our strength we need to have a constant flow of new recruits. However, the problem is that the number of our foals coming of age to join the Steel Rangers is still low. Because of this, we have authorized the conscription of 'outsiders' who show interest and/or loyalty to us, in the hopes of bolstering our numbers."

MSR_Multirole_Training:0 "Multirole Training"
MSR_Multirole_Training_desc:0 "We have recently come across some old military texts that talk about something called 'Multirole Training'. This training was supposed to allow soldiers to do each other's jobs incase certain specialists were 'incapacitated'. With this in mind, we shall immediately begin implementing this 'Multirole Training' into our regular training courses. Hopefully this will increase the number of combat ready troops we have."

MSR_Rangers_Lead_The_Way:0 "Ranger Lead the Way"
MSR_Rangers_Lead_The_Way_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of both the Paladins and Scribes, we have been able to completely overhaul how our armed forces function. They are better trained and better equipped to deal with what the wasteland throws at them. Now nothing can stand in the way of the Steel Rangers. Ad Victoriam!"

### Aviation Tree ###

MSR_Taking_To_The_Skies:0 "Taking to the Skies"
MSR_Taking_To_The_Skies_desc:0 "Pegasi and Gryphons thought they were the only ones who could tame the sky. Now it is our turn. Thanks to some 'generous' wrecks left behind by the Grand Pegasus Enclave, we have begun work on researching flight for the flightless."

MSR_Repairing_Old_Airfields:0 "Repairing Old Airfields"
MSR_Repairing_Old_Airfields_desc:0 "Bucklyn had very little in the way of a functioning air field, as it was only a part of the greater city of Manehattan. However, we got lucky, as the old borough did have a small municipal airport for pre-war civilian craft. With a bit of work, we could get it back up and running."

MSR_Secure_The_Skies:0 "Securing the Skies"
MSR_Secure_The_Skies_desc:0 "Complete air dominance is key for any military victory; at least it did in the old world. That may not be the biggest concern nowadays, but there is still sound logic too it."

MSR_Focus_On_Fighters:0 "Focus on Fighters"
MSR_Focus_On_Fighters_desc:0 "Due to resource constraints, we are greatly limited in our plane production capability. Because of this, we will focus on building fighters over CAS."

MSR_Dominate_The_Skies:0 "Dominate the Air-War"
MSR_Dominate_The_Skies_desc:0 "With our air power slowly increasing, no longer will the Pegasi control the sky unabated. Our brand new fighters will soon take to the air, showing that the Steel Ranger are not to be underestimated."

MSR_Flying_Fortresses:0 "Flying Fortresses"
MSR_Flying_Fortresses_desc:0 "Fighters are good, but if we really want to get an edge in the air war, we need to go big. Though they may be costly to produce, these airships are just what we need to gain the upper hoof."

MSR_Support_Our_Troops:0 "Support our Troops"
MSR_Support_Our_Troops_desc:0 "Our soldiers are the real concern of any military action; there is no doubt about that. Whether from the ground or from the air, we must make sure they are always supported."

MSR_Focus_On_CAS:0 "Focus on CAS"
MSR_Focus_On_CAS_desc:0 "Due to resource constraints, we are greatly limited on our plane production capability. Because of this, we will focus on building CAS over fighters."

MSR_Death_From_Above:0 "Death from Above"
MSR_Death_From_Above_desc:0 "Sturdy, accurate, and very effective against ground targets; dive bombers are perfect for dealing with any ground target. Our enemies won't know what hit them as we rain explosives from the sky."

MSR_Strategic_Bombing:0 "Strategic Bombing"
MSR_Strategic_Bombing_desc:0 "Sometimes the way to deal with the enemy, is to destroy everything that aides their war effort. This is where the genius of strategic bombing comes in; with these on our side, the enemy will surely be crushed."

MSR_birds_of_steel:0 "Birds of Steel"
MSR_birds_of_steel_desc:0 "Our air force has come a long way; never did I imagine that we would take to the skies ever again. It is such an amazing site, watching our planes take off towards their target mission. With our pilots watching our backs, we will surely become unstoppable."

#MSR.1.desc:0 "MSRpony Tower. A luxury hotel, known for housing the Ministry of Arcane Science's ManehatMSR Hub. When Balefire began raining from the sky, those ponies working within the Hub were some of the first to know. Orders came in from Canterlot to fire the prototype megaspell Celestia One at Roam, capital of the Zebra empire. Knowing that ManehatMSR would be a primary target, the ponies of the Ministry had to make a choice. They could follow their orders and focus on casting the megaspell, or ignore their orders and focus on using the ManehatMSR Emergency Broadcasting System to warn the residents of the city. There wouldn't be enough time to do both, and the seconds were ticking down."

MSR.1.title:0 "The Survivors"
MSR.1.desc:0 "We never expected it to come to this. The city around us burned while we just stood there, doing nothing. Eventually a stallion, possibly a commanding officer, began yelling at us, trying to get us to do something. But with the world ending right infront of us, what can we do?"
MSR.1.a:0 "Look for supplies before leaving."
MSR.1.b:0 "Look for survivors before leaving."
MSR.1.c:0 "Embrace the Darkness"

MSR.2.title:0 "Foundations of Steel"
MSR.2.desc:0 "The war has thrown us back to the stone age and if we wish to survive, we must rebuild. What industry do we want to rebuild first?"
MSR.2.a:0 "Fix up the old cannery."
MSR.2.b:0 "Rebuild the munitions factory."

MSR.3.title:0 "Rising Phoenix"
MSR.3.desc:0 "It is time we focus on strengthening ourselves. Only through our understanding of pre-war tech and years of experience combating the horrors created by the balefire, can we defend our claim in this wasteland."
MSR.3.a:0 "Reborn from the ashes of the old world."

### Cottage Events ###

MSR.7.title:0 "Staying on the Beaten Path"
MSR.7.desc:0 "It was a good feeling knowing that the contingent still believed in honoring tradition. Even with all the political divisions caused by Steel Hooves and Autumn River, the Steel Rangers of the Manehattan Contingent stood true to their oaths to Equestria. Now with power firmly back in the hooves of those who know how to properly wield it, Elder Cottage Cheese wasted no time getting things back into order. "
MSR.7.a:0 "OK"

MSR.8.title:0 "The Fate of the Council"
MSR.8.desc:0 "Though I must thank the council for so graciously letting me continue on as the Elder of the Manehattan Steel Rangers, as well as dealing with the more boring day to day tasks required to govern this contingent. Their need to constantly question some of the things I do is beginning to annoy me. This constant questioning could become a problem later down the road, and ridding myself of them would save me the headache. However, the provisionary council has become quite popular and dissolving the council could cause unrest among the lower ranks. Both choices have equal consequences, but in the end, the best option would be to..."
MSR.8.a:0 "Keep them"
MSR.8.b:0 "Get rid of them"

MSR.9.title:0 "The Visionary and the Despot"
MSR.9.desc:0 "Paladin Steel Hooves and Scribe Autumn River are both ticking time bombs. Their extremist views have already rocked this contingent enough and it's about high time we deal with them. The only problem is, I can't deal with them both. I need help from one of them, in other to rid myself of the other. Steel Hooves, though a big opposer of our current way of doing things, is one of the oldest living members of the Steel Rangers. His experience and knowledge in the field make him very popular among the other Knights and Paladins. This would easily help boost my popularity among the soldiers. However, Scribe Autumn River holds great sway among many of the scribes, as well as, some of the paladins. And even though I know she sees me as an old coot, unfit for Elder. She could greatly increase our technological advantage over the rest of the wasteland. This is a tough choice to make, but I must ultimately choose..."

MSR.9.b:0 "River Autumn"

MSR.11.title:0 "Increase Tech Scavenging"
MSR.11.desc:0 "We need to increase our efforts in recovering technology. The amount of oldworld tech still out there is numerous, but our ponypower is few. Because of this, we can't focus on collecting everything we find. So, in order to keep ourselves from being spread to thin, we have to... "
MSR.11.a:0 "The Weapons"
MSR.11.b:0 "The Power-Armor"

MSR.14.title:0 "A Helping Hoof?"
MSR.14.desc:0 "When I first came across the documents detailing the crusader maneframe, I couldn't believe it. The idea of becoming immortal, by putting both your mind and soul into a computer, sounded beyond absurd. But now, as I grow closer to deaths door, the idea sounds like it could just be my ticket to achieving glory. With my mind and soul in a crusader maneframe, I could continue to lead this contingent and act as a guide for future generations. However, with such little time left for me, I am finding it harder to work on this by myself. I could ask some scribes to help me out, thus giving me more time. However, I don't trust all of the scribes in this contingent. And the idea of trying to play god might not sit well with some of them. In the grand scheme of things, I should..."
MSR.14.a:0 "They will be useful"
MSR.14.b:0 "I'll keep my work to myself"

MSR.15.title:0 "Scavenging for Leads"
MSR.15.desc:0 "The information I am looking for could be anywhere. And with so many possible locations, it will take time to comb through everything we find. Time that I can ill afford. I could easily remedy this problem by increasing the number of scavenging teams I send out, but that could raise suspicion. The others, they might begin to ask what exactly they are looking for. What is so important to send so many Paladins and Knights away. I can't have that, not at all. But on the other hoof, I can't keep wasting the little time I have left; hoping that the small number of teams we currently send out will stumble across something useful. This 'project' is beginning to become a bit of a pain in my side. But, if I wish to succeed in my quest for immortality, I must make a choice."
MSR.15.a:0 "Covert Teams"
MSR.15.b:0 "Right through the Front door!"

MSR.16.title:0 "Stable 29"
MSR.16.desc:0 "Cottage Cheese watched patiently through the video feed, as the Steel Rangers on the other end cautiously made their way through raider territory. After a couple hours of tense silence, they group of Steel Rangers finally came across the marked sewer grate. Soon, the Steel Rangers found themselves standing in front of a large cog shaped door with the number 29 painted on it. The door slowly slid open while the Rangers watched in anticipation for any possible danger; only to be met with an unnerving silence. The Steel Rangers felt hesitant to enter, but the lead Paladin scoffed at them before trotting in. The Rangers crept their way through hallways, checking their EFS for any potential threats; only to still be greeted with same unnerving silence. The point pony continued to follow the schematics that she had downloaded into her helmet, quietly guiding the team to their destination. Eventually, the Ranger team found themselves standing outside a small, sealed hatch. With a bit of grit and some help from their power armor, the Rangers were able to breach the hatch. Cottage Cheese began to smile as the Rangers entered the hidden room. "Elder, is this what you were looking for?" the lead Paladin asked. There was a pause before Cottage responded. "Yes, yes, it is"."

MSR.18.desc:0 "I've been sifting through every ounce of data I have collected on this project of mine and I don't know what I missed. The documents mention the need for something else, but every mention of what it could be is redacted. This has put a massive hold on my work and I fear that I may fail if I can't find this missing piece. I must find what it is no matter the cost. I will leave no stone unturned; no terminal unread. I don't care what resources I waste; I have to find out what it is. It is the key to my ultimate success and nothing will stand in my way towards greatness!"

MSR.19.title:0 "Beyond Comprehension"
MSR.19.desc:0 "I can't believe what I am reading; this has to be made up. The key to this project working rests in some kind of Black Book created by the Zebras. It? It all makes sense now. There is no way that you could just integrate yourself into the maneframe; you would only be uploading you mind, but not your soul. Without this Black Book and whatever magic, it holds, you would be missing a crucial part of yourself. However, I feel hesitant to use this abominable form of magic; no pony should ever use such dark things. But, if I don't use it, my ultimate goal will never be complete. This is a difficult choice, but I already know my answer."
MSR.19.a:0 "I must keep going"

MSR.20.title:0 "Canterlot Expedition"
MSR.20.desc:0 "Cottage Cheese stared out at the group of Steel Rangers standing before him. As he quietly wheeled around them, he eventually made his way to the front of the group.\n\n"Knight and Paladins of this contingent. You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the Steel Rangers are upon you.\n\nYour task will not be an easy one. The area you will be going to is laden with mutated creatures and extreme hazards. The likes of which, you have never seen before.\n\nBut I have full confidence in your devotion to duty and skill in battle. I will accept nothing less than full success. Good luck! And may Celestia guide you through your endeavors.""

Cottage Cheese saluted the Paladin before taking the package from him and returning to room."

Dismissed!". The group of Steel Rangers saluted the Elder as he patiently watched him return to his room."

From there, I want you to begin searching for any possible clues as to who took it.". The group of Steel Rangers saluted the Elder as he patiently watched him return to his room."

They say that they have double checked everything within the Crusader Maneframe and have found nothing of concern. I trust the scribes in this work, mostly because I cared very little for it. All that technical mumbo jumbo; never really understood it. Hopefully they deal with any issues before it becomes a problem. I would hate for something to go wrong."

MSR.44.title:0 "Cannibals?"
MSR.44.desc:0 "Cannibals, right under our noses; I can't believe we never saw that. It is disgusting to think that those seemingly peaceful ponies were actually a bunch of meat crazed cannibals. Some of the knights are wanting to just execute them all, but others are asking me to intervene before things escalate too far. I am going to have to play this situation by ear and hope it doesn't backfire on me."

MSR.51.desc:0 "The scribes began to panic as they tried to figure what went wrong, but everything they did yielded the same bleak results. As the minutes slowly ticked by, the scribes found themselves beginning to lose hope; nothing they did seemed to bring their Elder back. Their luck only seemed to worsen when one of the scribes ran to the door; a group of unarmored Paladins standing on the other side with the look of murder in their eyes. Seizing on the moment, the Paladins stormed into the room and began to arrest the group of scribes."
MSR.51.a:0 "What in Celestia's name is going on?"

MSR.52.title:0 "Questioning"
MSR.52.desc:0 "The scribes broke easily; some of them cracked before we even laid a hoof on them. They spilled what they had been doing with the Elder and we were disturbed by what they told us. Black magic? Immortality? The more they told us about what Elder Cottage Cheese was up to, the more we felt they were lying. After a couple days of interrogation, we finally concluded that the scribes were most likely telling the truth. It was hard for us to accept, but our Elder was gone. May Celestia guide his soul."
