MSR_Finished:0 "Crisis of Faith"
MSR_Finished_desc:0 "The situation within the Contingent has become untenable. Between Cottage Cheese's abrasive and borderline-obsessive tendencies and the rising popularity of a pro-Steelhooves faction, it was rather inevitable that an emergency council would form to discuss the removal of the Elder."

MSR_Continue_1:0 "Foundation of Steel"
MSR_Continue_1_desc:0 "Technology is the only true way to move forward. We must salvage and rebuild as much as we can if we wish to not just survive, but thrive."

### Cottage Cheese - Continuism Path ###
MSR_Cottage:0 "Cottage Cheese Remains"
MSR_Cottage_desc:0 "The provisional council decided to let Cottage Cheese stay as acting Elder of the Manehattan Contingent. Now, with that nonsense out of the way, we can finally go back to doing our jobs."

MSR_Cottage_Council:0 "The Council"
MSR_Cottage_Council_desc:0 "The provisional council was just a temporary means to solve the issue of who would be Elder of this contingent. Is there really any need to keep them around?"

MSR_Cottage_Loyalties:0 "Where Loyalties Lie"
MSR_Cottage_Loyalties_desc:0 "The division that has plagued this contingent can be boiled down to two ponies. However, if I wanted to get rid of one, I would need help from the other."

MSR_Cottage_technician:0 "Reestablishing Control"
MSR_Cottage_technician_desc:0 "Now that the riff raff has been dealt with and the Provisionary Council decided upon. I must now turn my attention to re-affirming my control over this contingent."

MSR_Shoring_Up_Defense:0 "Shoring Up Defenses"
MSR_Shoring_Up_Defense_desc:0 "We are surrounded on all sides by potential enemies. Any of the factions or groups could attack us without warning. If we are to continue to survive here in Manehattan, we must make sure that every possible point of entry is properly secured."

MSR_Focusing_Our_Efforts:0 "Focusing Our Efforts"
MSR_Focusing_Our_Efforts_desc:0 "Our mission statement has been, and always will be the control and regulation of technology within the Equestrian Wasteland. We must continue to focus our efforts on this task if we wish to prevent another Great War from happening."

MSR_crusaders_desc:0 ""

MSR_A_New_Project:0 "A New Project"
MSR_A_New_Project_desc:0 "I am not getting any younger and this 'project' of mine is going to take a while to complete. Do I risk asking the scribes for help in my endeavor?"

MSR_Securing_Info:0 "Securing Information"
MSR_Securing_Info_desc:0 "So much information regarding this 'project' of mine has been scattered over time. If I wish to get any further on it, I must find and secure this information before it is truly lost forever."

MSR_A_New_Objective:0 "A New Objective"
MSR_A_New_Objective_desc:0 "Now that we have discovered the location of a functional Crusader Maneframe, all that's left to do is to actually secure said maneframe. Unfortunately, it is currently within the domain of a bunch of bloodthirsty raiders. In much better news, it seems that they lack advanced power armor and proper weaponry. There's only one way that this can end."

MSR_The_Mainframe:0 "The Maneframe"
MSR_The_Mainframe_desc:0 "We may have lost some good lives but it was all worth it in the end. My Knights and Paladins now move on Stable 29 with the hopes of securing what lies inside."

MSR_An_Unexp_Prob:0 "An Unexpected Problem"
MSR_An_Unexp_Prob_desc:0 "It seems that the Crusader Maneframe was only half of the equation. I am still missing something, but I don't know what."

MSR_Dark_Magic:0 "Dark Magic?"
MSR_Dark_Magic_desc:0 "The information from these documents seem almost... made up. But if they are to be believed, the true key to immortality lies down a very dark path."

MSR_The_Black_Book:0 "The Black Book"
MSR_The_Black_Book_desc:0 "I did it! I found the location of this so called 'Black Book'. The only problem is that it is located within the ruins of Canterlot. This will prove difficult, but if I can persuade some Rangers to go in, I may be able to complete this project."

MSR_Becoming_One:0 "Becoming One with Technology"
MSR_Becoming_One_desc:0 "After waiting so long, I finally have everything I need. All that is left is to conduct the ritual and pray that it succeeds."

### Cottage Success Route ###

MSR_Testing_The_Waters_S:0 "Testing the Waters"
MSR_Testing_The_Waters_S_desc:0 "Now that I am fully integrated with the Crusader Maneframe, it is time to see what I am capable of doing. So many new possibilities have opened up for me and I fully intend to utilize them all."

MSR_A_New_Era:0 "A New Era for the Steel Rangers"
MSR_A_New_Era_desc:0 "With my mind and soul now fully integrated into the Crusader Maneframe, it is time to get to work. There is so much that I can do; so many new avenues opening up. I have all the time in the world and nothing standing in my way. I, alone, will usher in a new era for the Steel Rangers."

MSR_maneframe_improvements:0 "Maneframe Improvements"
MSR_maneframe_improvements_desc:0 ""

MSR_Review_Our_Ind:0 "Review Our Industry"
MSR_Review_Our_Ind_desc:0 "Our industry is something I am proud of, but I know it can grow beyond its current state. Hopefully, with my new found processing power, I can work to increase our industrial capabilities to pre-war standards."

MSR_Recal_Ind_Out:0 "Recalculate Industrial Output"
MSR_Recal_Ind_Out_desc:0 "Our scribes work on repairing or stripping technology individually. This process is only effective if they are given small batches of technology at a time. With some simple calculations, I am sure I could help increase the scribes' technological output by at least 70%."

MSR_Anal_Res_Ext:0 "Analyze Resource Extraction"
MSR_Anal_Res_Ext_desc:0 "When we send out scavenging teams, they just start searching for anything useful to us. This process of scavenging is greatly inefficient and feels almost like a waste of their time. However, using my new capabilities, I will be able to reorganize our scavenging teams into highly efficient resource extractors."

MSR_Auto_Eff:0 "Automated Efficiency"
MSR_Auto_Eff_desc:0 "There are so many mundane tasks that our scribes and knights are forced to do in order to keep Bucklyn Cross running. This is a blatant waste of perfectly good ponypower; one that should not have gone unnoticed for this long. Now that I am in control of our base's robots, I intend to make good use of those old Mr. Handy's."

MSR_Rev_Our_Army:0 "Review Our Armed Forces"
MSR_Rev_Our_Army_desc:0 "Our Steel Rangers have been a force to be reckoned with within the ruins of Manehattan. However, they still can become better; it is just going to take some work. Luckily, I have all the time in the world now to make sure our Rangers are at their absolute best."

MSR_Eval_Ranger_Training:0 "Evaluate Ranger Training Programs"
MSR_Eval_Ranger_Training_desc:0 "The training to become a Steel Ranger is something to not be taken lightly. I should know, I went through it. However, I know I can do more to make sure the training the initiates receive is truly the best. Thanks to my new ability to analyze large amounts of data within seconds, I will be able to figure out what to keep within the training program and what to change."

MSR_Enforce_Chain_Binds:0 "Enforcing the Chain That Bind"
MSR_Enforce_Chain_Binds_desc:0 "The Chain That Binds is the cornerstone of our organization, the rock that supports the great tree of the Steel Rangers and its myriad of branches. For too long we have ignored this policy, giving commands freely and without care. If we wish to continue to survive, we must enforce it once more while punishing those who stray from it."

MSR_A_New_Army:0 "A New Army of Steel"
MSR_A_New_Army_desc:0 "Our troops have been more of a glorified defense force rather than a fully-fledged army. Thanks to my now endless computing capability and increased lifespan, I have been able to drastically change how our armed forces function. Soon, the wasteland will tremble at the might of the Manehattan Steel Rangers!"

MSR_Looking_Out:0 "Looking Outwards"
MSR_Looking_Out_desc:0 "For too long the Steel Rangers of Manehattan have been stuck in the background. Hiding away in Bucklyn Cross; surrounded from all sides by potential enemies. It is time we stand up and say no more. We will rise, like a phoenix from its ashes, and take back the city of Manehattan for ourselves."

MSR_Looking_Westward:0 "Looking Westward"
MSR_Looking_Westward_desc:0 "The west is home to two very powerful factions, both of which hold vast quantities of land and resources. Their presence has been a constant threat to us, but maybe it is time we turn the tables on them. If we could get our hooves on their resources, then we would be set for a while."             

MSR_Enter_New_Trotbany:0 "Entering New Trotbany"
MSR_Enter_New_Trotbany_desc:0 "Just like when the Visigoths marched into Roam after conquering the city, so did my Steel Rangers march into New Trotbany as conquerors. The siege of the city may have put a strain on our already limited resources. But once we get their territories under our control, we should see a massive increase in our resource stockpiles."

MSR_A_Summer_In_Summer:0 "A Summer in Summerfield"
MSR_A_Summer_In_Summer_desc:0 "Before the Great War, Summerfield was supposed to be a quiet suburb. There, young couples would go to start families and old couples would live out the rest of their lives. Now it sits in a state of ruin, rotting away as raiders turned it into their home. Maybe after we clear out the raiders we could turn this trash heap back into something livable."

MSR_Repairing_the_roads:0 "Repairing the Roadways"
MSR_Repairing_the_roads_desc:0 "With the lands to our east now secured, we can begin focusing on some reconstruction efforts. There isn't much out in this region, but there are a number of old roads that could serve some purpose. If we spend the time and resources to repair them, I calculate that both our trade and military deployment speed would increase by at least 35%."

MSR_Moving_South:0 "Moving South"
MSR_Moving_South_desc:0 "Just south of Bucklyn Cross lies a number of very minor factions; most of whom have never presented a real danger. However, if any one of them gained full control of the peninsula, then they would pose a threat to our security. In order to prevent that, we will move in and secure the region before any of them can."

MSR_Breaking_Peninsula:0 "Breaking the Peninsula"
MSR_Breaking_Peninsula_desc:0 "There is still much resistance to my rule within the Manehattan peninsula. They may not be privy to our sudden arrival, but they must understand that we are here to do them good. However, if they still won't accept me as their new guardian, I will gladly show them why they shouldn't disobey my rule."

MSR_Getting_Rid_Raiders:0 "Getting Rid of the Raiders"
MSR_Getting_Rid_Raiders_desc:0 "Even after we destroyed the bulk of their raider forces, the Manehattan raiders continue to be a nuisance to anypony who move through that region. I think it is time we took care of these raider remnants once and for all. Only when they are all completely wiped off the face of Equus will I be satisfied."

MSR_Securing_Tenpony:0 "Securing Tenpony"
MSR_Securing_Tenpony_desc:0 "Tenpony is the pride and jewel of the Manehattan ruins. It has stood strong for over 200 years, housing those who have the caps to pay in luxury that isn't seen anywhere else. However, what many don't know is that Tenpony also houses a large stockpile of technology that once belonged to the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. Now with Tenpony under our control, we can begin to crack open those vaults."

MSR_Retaking_the_East:0 "Retaking the East"
MSR_Retaking_the_East_desc:0 "There may not be a lot to the east of us, but that doesn't mean that they are entirely useless. There are still some resources we could gain from controlling that territory, not to mention the old dockyards."

MSR_Clearing_Arbu:0 "Clearing Arbu"
MSR_Clearing_Arbu_desc:0 "Arbu surprisingly tried to fight back against my sudden takeover; something I did not expect from them. They seemed like they were trying to hide something from us but we haven't figured out what. Our best guess is that they might have some technology that they don't want us to have. I'll be sure to have some knights search every inch of that settlement once we clean up the last of the resistance."

MSR_Controlling_Ports:0 "Controlling the Ports"
MSR_Controlling_Ports_desc:0 "Portshoof may not seem like such a strategic location to others, but I know better. The old Manehattan drydocks hold many secrets within them, especially since Equestria's Eastern fleet called them home. Maybe we will even get lucky and find a still intact warship. One can only hope."

MSR_Rebuilding_Dockyards:0 "Rebuilding the Dockyards"
MSR_Rebuilding_Dockyards_desc:0 "The Manehattan dockyards were once a bustling center of trade, shipping a plethora of goods to various locations. Now they are just another scrap heap in the ruins of the city. However, using some of our newly gained resources we could attempt to get these docks back into working order. This could prove beneficial if we wish to increase our ability to trade, or even decide to build a navy of our own."

MSR_A_Wealth_Technology:0 "A Wealth of Technology"
MSR_A_Wealth_Technology_desc:0 "Ever since I completed my goal of becoming one with technology, the Steel Rangers have become more than I imagined. Not only have we had a territorial increase of well beyond 1000%, but we have increased out tech stockpiles well beyond their capacity. Never have I been prouder to see our mission come to pass. This is truly a great era for the Steel Rangers."

MSR_A_New_City_Rises:0 "A New City Rises"
MSR_A_New_City_Rises_desc:0 "I may have been called crazy in the past, but there is no doubt that I have brought greatness to the Steel Rangers. For the first time in 200 years, the entire city of Manehattan is under the control of a single faction. With the city's combined resources I could not just rebuild Bucklyn Cross, but the entirety of Manehattan. It may be a costly endeavor to take on, but it would also cement the Steel Ranger name into history. Forever!"

### Cottage Failure Route ###

MSR_Testing_The_Waters_F:0 "Testing the Waters"
MSR_Testing_The_Waters_F_desc:0 "Now that I am fully integrated with the Crusader Maneframe, it is time to see what I am capable of doing. So many new possibilities have opened up for me and I fully intend to utilize them all."

MSR_Eval_Situation:0 "Evaluating the Situation"
MSR_Eval_Situation_desc:0 "It seems that something has happened to our Elder. We don't know what, however. We must look into this before the others start to take notice of his absence."

MSR_New_Provisional_Council:0 "Form A New Provisional Council"
MSR_New_Provisional_Council_desc:0 "With the Elder declared dead the Manehattan Steel Rangers are in a state of chaos. We must form an emergency council in order to regain some stability."

MSR_Call_Back_Teams:0 "Call Back the Scavenging Teams"
MSR_Call_Back_Teams_desc:0 "With so many issues on the home front the Council doesn't think it is wise to continue sending out scavenging teams. Therefore it has been decided that we will cease all outside scavenging operations at least until things settle down."

MSR_Secure_Our_Ass:0 "Secure Our Assets"
MSR_Secure_Our_Ass_desc:0 "With so many stockpiles of technology within our territory we need to make sure that they are all accounted for. We can't afford losing anything from them, as that could cause problems for us in the future."

MSR_Geat_Head_Count:0 "Get a Head Count"
MSR_Geat_Head_Count_desc:0 "With so many Steel Rangers working outside Bucklyn Cross we must ensure that each of them has heeded our call to return. If any Ranger is missing, we must figure out where they have gone to and bring them back."

MSR_Limit_Outside_Operation:0 "Limit Outside Operations"
MSR_Limit_Outside_Operation_desc:0 "We can't fully cut ourselves off, as we still have missions to conduct and resources to gather. Instead we will limit outside operations to only those that the Council deems necessary."

MSR_Deal_With_The_Traitors:0 "Deal With the 'Traitors'"
MSR_Deal_With_The_Traitors_desc:0 "The idea that our Elder was using dark magic to achieve immortality within a machine is knowledge that the council does not want to get out. Because of this, it has been decided that we will label anypony who had intimate knowledge of the Elder's plans as 'traitors' and deal with them immediately."

MSR_Reinforce_Old_Ways:0 "Reinforce the Old Ways"
MSR_Reinforce_Old_Ways_desc:0 "Due to the Elder's obsession with his project we had begun to stray from our mission. If we wish to regain any of our lost honor, we must reinforce the old ways by any means necessary."

MSR_Purge_Any_Opposition:0 "Purge Any Opposition"
MSR_Purge_Any_Opposition_desc:0 "We must ensure that the Manehattan Steel Rangers are united as one. To that end, we will have to rid ourselves of anypony who doesn't fully agree with what we are doing."

MSR_Enforce_Lock_Down:0 "Enforce Lockdown Protocol"
MSR_Enforce_Lock_Down_desc:0 "Our enemies hunt us like animals; if we wish to protect ourselves, we must hide. Enacting the lockdown protocol will ensure that our enemies can't find us and our rangers stay safe. It will be tough to endure, but we do this for the greater good of our contingent."

MSR_Evaluate_Our_Contingent:0 "Evaluate Our Contingent"
MSR_Evaluate_Our_Contingent_desc:0 "This contingent has been through a lot in the past couple of weeks. The Council has deemed it necessary to evaluate the contingent to make sure that we are still up to Steel Ranger standards."

MSR_Cease_Outsider_Recruitment:0 "Cease Outsider Recruitment"
MSR_Cease_Outsider_Recruitment_desc:0 "It is hard to say if we can really trust any of these outsiders. With no way to truly pinpoint exactly who these ponies are or where they came from, the Council has decided that it would be best to cease all outside recruitment until 'further notice.'"

MSR_Dissuade_Outside_Contact:0 "Dissuade Outside Contact"
MSR_Dissuade_Outside_Contact_desc:0 "Many of these outsiders carry diseases, leech off our limited resources, or have ulterior motives. These reasons alone are enough to implement a non-member contact rule. It will be enforced until the Council decides otherwise."

MSR_Ensure_Steel_Ranger_Purity:0 "Ensure Steel Ranger Purity"
MSR_Ensure_Steel_Ranger_Purity_desc:0 "We will be conducting medical tests of every one of our members. This is to ensure that they are all fit and healthy to serve within our ranks. Those who do not meet our standards will be swiftly dealt with."

MSR_Strict_Isolation:0 "Strict Isolationism"
MSR_Strict_Isolation_desc:0 "We have exposed ourselves too much to the wasteland. We were told that this would do us good, but all it has done is drive us to the brink of total collapse. To ensure our continued existence we have to cut ourselves off from the rest of the wasteland."

### River Autumn Intro - Deposime Path ###
MSR_River:0 "End of the Deadlock"
MSR_River_desc:0 "The provisional council went gone quiet. Nopony knew what happened to them, but some began to worry. That worry only increased when the sound of energy weapons reverberated from the Elder's quarters."

MSR_The_New_Dev:0 "The New Elder"
MSR_The_New_Dev_desc:0 "As much as River Autumn wanted to dance on the ashes of her former Elder, she knew she couldn't celebrate just yet. There was still a long way to go before she could truly claim victory and declaring herself Elder was only the first step."

MSR_Secure_Our_Tech:0 "Secure our Tech"
MSR_Secure_Our_Tech_desc:0 "Over the past couple of months, my co-conspirators and I have been diligent enough to stash away a large quantity of valuable technology. If we want to be able to keep the momentum going, we must secure these stashes."

MSR_Seize_The_Memes:0 "Seize the Means of Production"
MSR_Seize_The_Memes_desc:0 "With my forces now somewhat armed we can begin moving to seize the factories and trade routes. If we can get them under our control, we might be able to gain the upperhoof."

MSR_Scribe_Support:0 "Guarantee Scribe Support"
MSR_Scribe_Support_desc:0 "Many of Scribes within our ranks have sworn their loyalty to me, but there are still those whose allegiance is unknown. I must ensure that I have their full support before I proceed with my next step."

MSR_Storm_The_Armory:0 "Storm the Armory"
MSR_Storm_The_Armory_desc:0 "With my troops ready to go, we can now begin our final push towards the armory. If we can secure its contents before they seal it off, nothing will stand in our way of achieving victory."

MSR_Gather_The_Rangers:0 "Gather the Rangers"
MSR_Gather_The_Rangers_desc:0 "Convincing the lower ranks to join me is not what will be difficult. The hard part is assuring them that I was in the right to kill the former Elder and take his place."

MSR_Secure_Loyalty:0 "Secure Paladin Loyalty"
MSR_Secure_Loyalty_desc:0 "The Paladins are a fierce bunch of warriors who are completely devoted to the Steel Ranger cause. And as much as it would be easy to just kill them, convincing a few to join me could help legitimize my position even more."

MSR_Dissent:0 "Deal with Dissent"
MSR_Dissent_desc:0 "It is disheartening to see that there are still some who see me as a murderer who took power for personal gain. They are correct. Howver, I would prefer that they didn't voice their opinions so openly."

MSR_Night_Of_Long_Knives:0 "Night of Long Knives"
MSR_Night_Of_Long_Knives_desc:0 "It is a shame to waste such good talent, but then again, I never fully trusted any of them. In the end this is just another chore I am going to have to deal with before reaching my end goal."

MSR_Thorn_In_My_Side:0 "A Thorn in my Side"
MSR_Thorn_In_My_Side_desc:0 "Though my power continues to grow each day, one persistent stallion keeps attempting to stop me. That rat bastard Steelhooves and his so called 'Applejack's Rangers' have become a real pain in my flank. I think it is high time we end their little parade. Once and for all."

MSR_Crushing_The_Rebellion:0 "Crushing any Rebellion"
MSR_Crushing_The_Rebellion_desc:0 "With every major opposition leader exiled or dead, dealing with the remaining pockets of rebellion will be a piece of cake. Soon nopony will stand in my way of achieving total control."

MSR_Cementing_Controls:0 "Cementing Control"
MSR_Cementing_Controls_desc:0 "There is nothing left standing in my way. I am the undisputed Elder. It may have been a bloody couple of months, but it was all worth it. Soon all within the Manehattan ruins shall learn to fear the name River Autumn."

### River Autumn Extended - Deposime Path ###

MSR_Steel_Rangers_No_More:0 "Steel Rangers No More"
MSR_Steel_Rangers_No_More_desc:0 "With power now firmly in my hooves, I can finally do away with the Steel Rangers. No more shall their technophilic ways taint this region and destroy that which wishes to thrive. By the time I am done, the only thing that will be left of them to be remembered will be a few pieces of tattered cloth."

MSR_A_Nation_Reborn:0 "A Nation Reborn"
MSR_A_Nation_Reborn_desc:0 "It is time for Equestria to rise from the ashes once more. With the Manehattan Steel Rangers all but a memory and power firmly in my control, nothing can stand in my way of achieving greatness."

MSR_Rebuild_Our_Industry:0 "Rebuild our Industry"
MSR_Rebuild_Our_Industry_desc:0 "The conflict caused by my sudden ascension to Elder has done quite a number on our economy. Production has all but ceased and many of the facilities are in various states of damage. If I want to turn this nation into a true wasteland powerhouse we are going to need to have a functioning industrial base."

MSR_Giving_Out_Aid:0 "Giving Out Aid"
MSR_Giving_Out_Aid_desc:0 "To help secure the legitimacy of the New Equestrian Enclave within the wasteland, we need to start improving our nation's image. Luckily for us, there are hundreds of ponies living in Bucklyn who would be more than grateful to have somepony come along and help prop them up."

MSR_Outlaw_Slavery:0 "Outlaw Slavery"
MSR_Outlaw_Slavery_desc:0 "It seems one of the easiest ways to garner large swaths of support within the wasteland is to become a 'liberator of the oppressed:' To fight against those who wish to enslave others for personal use. If that is what it takes to gain popular support, then I guess that is what the New Equestrian Enclave shall become."

MSR_Healthcare_For_All:0 "Healthcare for All"
MSR_Healthcare_For_All_desc:0 "Free healthcare may seem like a giant waste of resources to almost anypony with half a brain, but I say otherwise. Making sure that everypony who lives in the New Equestrian Enclave has access to proper medical care will ensure that they will always be fit for military or labor service."

MSR_Project_Purity:0 "Project Purity"
MSR_Project_Purity_desc:0 "I have been told on numerous occasions that this will be a massive waste of resources. Building so many water purification plants and then freely distrubuting water seems ludicrous. However, if this project succeeds, the support I gain will grow beyond what anypony could have dreamed of."

MSR_New_Construction_Methods:0 "New Construction Methods"
MSR_New_Construction_Methods_desc:0 "The Great War destroyed many old-world ideas; one of which being standardized construction methods. Trying to go and find many of the old-world construction methods would most likely be a waste of time. Instead of trying to do that, we will just create our own construction methods."

MSR_Product_For_Civilians:0 "Products for Civilians"
MSR_Product_For_Civilians_desc:0 "Making sure that the civilian population has consumer products for them to buy will not only help to strengthen our economy, but it will also help to distract them from some of the unsavory things that happen around here."

MSR_Guns_For_Soldiers:0 "Guns for Soldiers"
MSR_Guns_For_Soldiers_desc:0 "Ensuring that every soldier is properly equipped to fight for our cause should trump all other arguments. The readiness of our nation's armed forces should always be at the forefront of every citizen's mind."

MSR_Factories_For_The_Future:0 "Factories for the Future"
MSR_Factories_For_The_Future_desc:0 "You can never have enough factories producing goods for the state. Otherwise the demand for products by the common citizen will be sated. Therefore, through storing away the needed materials and equipment, we will ensure that we are always prepared for when the need for new factories arises."

MSR_Rebuild_The_Roads:0 "Rebuilding the Roads"
MSR_Rebuild_The_Roads_desc:0 "Roads are the veins of any functional society. They allow vital supplies to quickly get from point A to B. Although all of Equestria's original roads have decayed beyond usability, we now have ample supplies to begin both repairing the old roads and building new ones."

MSR_Standardize_Production:0 "Standardize Production"
MSR_Standardize_Production_desc:0 "For too long we have been reliant on any old-world equipment we could get out hooves on. Initially, this was helpful when we only had to focus on rebuilding old-world technology. But now that our economy is rapidly growing we need to begin standardizing production in order to keep up with the ever-increasing demand."

MSR_Create_New_Labor_Laws:0 "Create New Labor Laws"
MSR_Create_New_Labor_Laws_desc:0 "I believe that ensuring the rights of every working pony is essential to our nation's survival. More importantly, I also hold that fooling the workers into believe they have rights is also paramount to keeping my power. In order to maintain this delicate balance, I will create some 'Labor Law's' in order to appease the masses."

MSR_A_New_Equestrian_Economy:0 "A New Equestrian Economy"
MSR_A_New_Equestrian_Economy_desc:0 "The New Equestrian Enclave cannot survive on wasteland economics any longer. Our continuous growth has created the need for new economic ideas and policies that will help to keep up with our nation's ever increasing demands."

MSR_Industrial_Hearland_Reborn:0 "Industrial Heartland Reborn"
MSR_Industrial_Hearland_Reborn_desc:0 "Not in the past 200 years has a nation become such a powerhouse within the ruins of Manehattan. Our economy has reached that of a small pre-war country, while our position within the wasteland has grown far beyond what even the Steel Rangers could dream of. If we can keep this momentum going, we could soon begin to rival the likes of Red Eye and his Slavers."

MSR_Expanding_Our_Borders:0 "Expanding Our Borders"
MSR_Expanding_Our_Borders_desc:0 "Our current position is pitiful. We are trapped within the ruins of Bucklyn with barely any room to stand, while struggling daily to gather enough recources to get by. If we want to truly call ourselves a nation, we must increase the amount of living space we have."

MSR_Sacking_The_Empire:0 "Sacking the Empire"
MSR_Sacking_The_Empire_desc:0 "The Empire has sat comfortably against our north-western border for quite some time now. Their vast swaths of land and resources silently mocking us. It is time we march into their lands and take what should rightfully be ours."

MSR_Raining_No_More:0 "Raining No More"
MSR_Raining_No_More_desc:0 "The Rain Riders think they are so high and mighty, all because they control the trade routes leading westward. With a large force of raiders and mercenaries, they believe they can defeat any foe that comes their way. Well, we'll see how high and mighty they are after the fire bombs start dropping."

MSR_A_Free_Trip_to_Freeside:0 "A Free Trip to Freeside"
MSR_A_Free_Trip_to_Freeside_desc:0 "The Freeside Raiders are more of a nuisance than an actual threat. Their cross-border raids have been so easily repelled that the border guards have starting making games out of it. Sadly, I do think we need to take them for good, even if that puts a damper on some of my soldiers' fun."

MSR_Clearing_Out_Cannibals:0 "Clearing Out Cannibals"
MSR_Clearing_Out_Cannibals_desc:0 "Reports have surfaced that there might be cannibals within the settlement of Arbu. An absolutely loathome practice: I hope they aren't true. However, if they are, we've just gained a solid excuse to send the troops in."

MSR_Pushing_Towards_Portshoof:0 "Pushing Towards Portshoof"
MSR_Pushing_Towards_Portshoof_desc:0 "Portshoof has become quite the center for trade. The vast amount of resources moving in and out of their markets is quite impressive. Such a shame that we will be confiscating it all."

MSR_Taking_Stable_29:0 "Taking Stable 29"
MSR_Taking_Stable_29_desc:0 "Stable 29 has always been of a place of great interest to the Steel Rangers, especially to Elder Cottage Cheese. If I wish to find out what was keeping the late Elder up every night, I will have to also deal with the Raiders the occupy the area around it."

MSR_Crossing_Into_Marelem:0 "Crossing into Marelem"
MSR_Crossing_Into_Marelem_desc:0 "Marelem sits right across the pond from us, quietly waiting for somepony to aid them against their raider neighbors. That day has come. The New Equestrian Enclave will gladly stand up and protect them so long as they submit to us."

MSR_Dinner_In_Tenpony:0 "Dinner at Tenpony"
MSR_Dinner_In_Tenpony_desc:0 "Tenpony is quite a sight to see in the wasteland. And with how much they have to offer for those that can afford it, annexing them could provide quite a nice place for me to dine along with fellow officers and politicians."

MSR_Moving_To_End_Friendship:0 "Moving to End Friendship"
MSR_Moving_To_End_Friendship_desc:0 "Friendship City has always served as a safe haven for those that wish to try and escape the horrors of the wasteland. As much as I admire what they are doing to help those in need, I also don't like seeing others trying to outdo my work."

MSR_Eastward_Expansion:0 "Eastward Expansion"
MSR_Eastward_Expansion_desc:0 "East of our territories lie a number of tribes who seem to only bumble about rather than do anything worthwhile. Only through conequest can these backward nations hope to become civilized and be useful."

MSR_March_Along_the_Coast:0 "Shadow over Sunrise"
MSR_March_Along_the_Coast_desc:0 "The Sunrise region of the Equestrian Wasteland is home to a number of varying nations who claim ownership of its lands. Such a pity that none of these nations know that, I too, lay claim to their lands."

MSR_Send_in_The_Peace_Keepers:0 "Send in the Peacekeepers"
MSR_Send_in_The_Peace_Keepers_desc:0 "It seems like not everypony appreciates being told that they are now part of the New Equestrian Enclave. It's almost like they want to keep scraping by without any ensurance of their survival. If they want to speak out against all the good things we are doing for them, then I will just have to show them how I deal with dissent."

MSR_Stirring_Up_Trouble:0 "Stirring Up Trouble"
MSR_Stirring_Up_Trouble_desc:0 "It seems like a new threat has begun to rub against our borders. This stallion, Red Eye, and his army of slavers are possibly the biggest threat we have ever seen. This will be our greatest challenge yet and we must use every advantage we can get if we hope to defeat them. Lucky for us, I think I have an idea."

MSR_Ending_Red_Eyes_Reign:0 "Ending Red Eye's Reign"
MSR_Ending_Red_Eyes_Reign_desc:0 "With our forces now in position and the rebels now properly armed, it is time to bring an end to Red Eye's parade. If we can win this war, nothing will stand in my way of achieving greatness."

MSR_Freeing_the_Enslaved:0 "\"Freeing\" the Enslaved"
MSR_Freeing_the_Enslaved_desc:0 "As I drive around Red Eye's former territories, I am greeted by the cheers and admiration of his former slaves. They view me as their hero in the wastes; a messiah sent to free them from their shackles. It fills my heart with laughter knowing that they think that they are truly free under my rule. I won't say anything, though. I'd hate to spoil their fun."

MSR_Meeting_Old_Friends:0 "Meeting Old Friends"
MSR_Meeting_Old_Friends_desc:0 "It seems that the Fillydelphia Steel Rangers have managed to survive, even after all that has happened around them. Maybe I should go and pay them a visit, just to see how they are doing."

MSR_Retaking_the_Heartland:0 "Retaking the Heartland"
MSR_Retaking_the_Heartland_desc:0 "The New Equestrian Enclave stands on top. No other nation dares to threaten us. Our recent territorial gains have given us vast quantities of resources and ponypower which will help to further my goals. With our position in the wasteland better than ever before, it is time to for us to move to the final stage of my ultimate plan: retaking all of Equestria."

MSR_A_New_Equestrian_Army:0 "A New Equestrian Army"
MSR_A_New_Equestrian_Army_desc:0 "My forces are currently poorly organized, under trained, and barely disciplined. My only saving grace being that the majority of them are former Steel Ranger veterans. If we want to be able to stand hoof to hoof with those around us, I am going to have to reorganize my forces into a proper army."

MSR_A_Organized_Army:0 "An Organized Army"
MSR_A_Organized_Army_desc:0 "A well organized and well-equipped army stands above all who face it. Making sure every soldier has a proper rifle and equipment should be our top priority in the face of war."

MSR_Infantry_Support_Weapons:0 "Infantry Support Weapons"
MSR_Infantry_Support_Weapons_desc:0 "It would be wise to make sure that each of our divisions are properly supported. From medics to machine guns; maintenance to artillery. These Combat Support and Combat Service Support teams will be crucial in making sure our soldiers can stay in the fight."

MSR_Raining_Fire:0 "Raining Fire"
MSR_Raining_Fire_desc:0 "Thanks to our ever-expanding industrial base, we have begun the production of new Artillery guns that will surely turn the tables in our favor. These aptly named Earth Shakers will put the fear of Celestia into the hearts of any enemy who is unlucky enough to be within its firing range."

MSR_An_Highly_Mobile_Army:0 "A Highly Mobile Army"
MSR_An_Highly_Mobile_Army_desc:0 "A force that is quick enough to react to any situation is crucial to waging wars in the wasteland. These motorized units will be able to outpace any foot soldier while still maintaining combat effectiveness."

MSR_Putting_Guns_On_Trucks:0 "Putting Guns on Trucks"
MSR_Putting_Guns_On_Trucks_desc:0 "Some of our soldiers have decided to add steel plates and heavy machine guns to some of the old trucks we have been repairing. At first it seemed like a waste of resources, but after reading about how well they have performed, I think it is time I gave them another look."

MSR_Beasts_of_Steel:0 "Beasts of Steel"
MSR_Beasts_of_Steel_desc:0 "Tanks were once considered to be an essential part of modern warfare, but thanks to the Great War, they are nothing more that massive scrap heaps. However, now that our industrial base has grown quite a considerable size we could bring life back into these steel beasts."

MSR_Hiring_New_Generals:0 "Hiring New Generals"
MSR_Hiring_New_Generals_desc:0 "Thanks to those little purges of mine, we are entirely lacking a competent command staff. And as much as we are in need of a number of high ranker officers, I would rather not just start promoting random soldier. Luckily, some of my contacts have informed me of some potential candidates that might just fit the bill."

MSR_Office_of_Internal_Integrity:0 "Office of Internal Integrity"
MSR_Office_of_Internal_Integrity_desc:0 "There will always be those who wish to speak out against, protest against, or even attempt to overthrow me.

MSR_Keeping_the_Peace:0 "Keeping the Peace"
MSR_Keeping_the_Peace_desc:0 "With threats looming around every corner, trying to ensure that peace is maintained within the state is going to be difficult to achieve. To remedy this, a specialized unit of enforcers have been created to deal with any major threat thrown their way. These 'Peacekeepers' will become the spearhead for the New Equestrian Enclave military. They shall instill fear into those who get in their way."

MSR_Service_Gurantees_Citizenship:0 "Service Guarantees Citizenship"
MSR_Service_Gurantees_Citizenship_desc:0 "We can't just have anypony be considered a citizen of the New Equestrian Enclave. We only want the best. And only through serving the needs of the state could one even fathom the idea of becoming a citizen. Becoming a citizen should be considered a privilege and never something taken for granted."

MSR_Deployment_Groups:0 "Deployment Groups"
MSR_Deployment_Groups_desc:0 "As much as I resented how much the Steel Rangers worshiped power armor, one can't ignore how useful it is in combat. And given the number of former Steel Rangers within the New Equestrian Enclave, it wouldn't be a bad idea to bring these specialized units back into service."

MSR_Going_In_Guns_Blazing:0 "Going in Guns Blazing"
MSR_Going_In_Guns_Blazing_desc:0 "Power armor is far from ideal for conducting operations behind enemy lines. The best we can do is have the units show up at a strategic location and start gunning down anything that moves. It may not be the best plan of action for these units, but they can still do some good for the war effort."

MSR_Vertibuck_Assault_Teams:0 "Vertibuck Assault Teams"
MSR_Vertibuck_Assault_Teams_desc:0 "To help increase the effectiveness of our deployment groups, we have allotted them the use of some of our recently built Vertibucks. These Vertibucks will hopefully decrease the amount of time that they are behind enemy lines, while allowing them to maintain full combat effectiveness."

MSR_Special_Intervention_Force:0 "Special Intervention Force"
MSR_Special_Intervention_Force_desc:0 "Power armor may make oneself a walking tank, but when it comes to conducting special or covert operations, it is pretty much useless. What we need instead are specially designated, organized, trained, and equipped forces who can use unconventional means to wage war against our enemies."

MSR_Asymmetric_Warfare:0 "Asymmetric Warfare"
MSR_Asymmetric_Warfare_desc:0 "The Special Intervention Force knows that no amount of training or top of the line equipment will save them if they get into a fierce firefight. That is why every member in this unit is taught to use everything in their environment to aid in the battle, no matter how cruel or unusual it may be."

MSR_Long_Range_Wasteland_Group:0 "Long Range Wasteland Group"
MSR_Long_Range_Wasteland_Group_desc:0 "Conducting operations outside our borders is in no way an easy task. These long-range special operations units will do everything within their power to make sure that any outside threat to this nation is swiftly dealt with. With too many threats to even count, only the best of the best will be considered for these potentially dangerous missions."

MSR_Army_of_Freedom:0 "Army of \"Freedom\""
MSR_Army_of_Freedom_desc:0 "Never before has a military force of such standing professionalism been seen within the wasteland in over 200 years.

### Steelhooves Intro - Survialism/Visionary Path ##

MSR_Hooves:0 "Steelhooves Becomes Elder"
MSR_Hooves_desc:0 "The provisional council has chosen Steelhooves as the new Elder of the Manehattan Contingent. Many members are surprised by this, but some are hopeful that he will lead them into a brighter tomorrow."

MSR_Hold_Speech:0 "Hold a Speech"
MSR_Hold_Speech_desc:0 "I am not one to give speeches, but I was told this might help to ease some of the tension building up. Let's just hope I don't mess this one up."

MSR_Talk_With_Paladins:0 "Talk with the Paladins"
MSR_Talk_With_Paladins_desc:0 "Many of the Paladins within this contingent weren't too happy when they heard that I was chosen as their next Elder. I think it would be wise to talk with them before they do something brash."

MSR_Meet_With_Scribes:0 "Meet with the Scribes"
MSR_Meet_With_Scribes_desc:0 "The scribes have always been important to the politics of the Steel Rangers but they've always been focused more on their work than what's going on around them. If I could convince them to support me, it could help in legitimizing my position."

MSR_Exile_Extremists:0 "Exile the Extremists"
MSR_Exile_Extremists_desc:0 "The Steel Rangers has always been home to a number of unsavory characters who would rather do as they please without interference. I can't allow these types within our ranks and know that we must rid ourselves of them before they attempt to push back. It will be tough to let so many Rangers go, but it must be done if we wish to change who we are."

MSR_Rid_The_Old_Ways:0 "Rid of the Old Ways"
MSR_Rid_The_Old_Ways_desc:0 "The old ways have held us back for a long time. They've prevented us from becoming something more. From our distrust of outsiders to our complete obsession with technology, there's always been something that hindered our potential. It is time we rid ourselves of these ideals and look toward something new."

MSR_Rally_The_Rangers:0 "Rally the Steel Rangers"
MSR_Rally_The_Rangers_desc:0 "With the majority of the Manehattan contingent on my side, it is time we rally them to our cause; only then can we begin to bring change to the Steel Rangers. The road ahead is going to be a difficult one and there will be many obstacles in our way. If we stand united, however, we shall endure anything that comes our way."

MSR_Break_The_Chains:0 "Break the Chains"
MSR_Break_The_Chains_desc:0 "The 'Chain That Binds' is something that only brought more harm than good, even when in it was implemented. My years in the military showed me that a flexible command structure works more efficiently than one that is rigid."

MSR_Change_Our_Approach:0 "Change our Approach"
MSR_Change_Our_Approach_desc:0 "Whenever we dealt with any kind of situation our approach always seemed to barge in and do as we please. I think it is time we find a more diplomatic approach to solving an issue and only start barging in when that option has truly failed."

MSR_Our_Original_Mission:0 "Our Original Mission"
MSR_Our_Original_Mission_desc:0 "We turned away almost any outsider who begged for our help because they weren't one of us. We refused to shelter those who needed protection and left them to fend for themselves. I say: no more! For the first time in almost 200 years, we shall cast aside what made us who we are and find a new purpose in life. From this day forth we shall dedicate ourselves to our original mission: protecting the ponies of Equestria from those who wish to do them harm."

### Steelhooves Route ###

MSR_Steel_Rangers_Reborn:0 "Steel Rangers Reborn"
MSR_Steel_Rangers_Reborn_desc:0 "If we wish to try and distance ourselves from the Steel Rangers, we must come up with a new name for ourselves. I believe I have an idea that will not only honor our oaths to Equestria, but the mare that helped to create us."

MSR_Allow_More_Outsiders:0 "Allow More Outsiders"
MSR_Allow_More_Outsiders_desc:0 "There have been many ponies that have come to us, eager to join. Because of our policies against outsiders, we turned them away. However, after talking to some of the members of this contingent, I have found it unnecessary to continue this policy. From now on we will allow any able-bodied ponies into our ranks as fully fledged members of the Applejack's Rangers."

MSR_Open_Up_Outside_Relations:0 "Open Up Outside Relations"
MSR_Open_Up_Outside_Relations_desc:0 "We have isolated ourselves for too long and the strain on resources is beginning to show itself. It would be wise to form relations with outside settlements if we wish to survive. We need to get the ball rolling on this, as it may take some time for settlements to agree to the idea of trading with us."

MSR_Increase_Patrols:0 "Increase Patrols"
MSR_Increase_Patrols_desc:0 "Before, patrol groups only patrolled the area immediately around Bucklyn Cross. I believe it prudent to not only increase the number of patrols we have but also extend the area in which they patrol. This would allow us to more effectively deter raider attacks while also showing the local wastelanders that we are there to protect them."

MSR_Protecting_Wastelanders:0 "Protecting Wastelanders"
MSR_Protecting_Wastelanders_desc:0 "It seems our work is starting to pay off. Ponies in and around the Bucklyn area have begun to thank us for our service to them. With this initial success, I feel it is a good time to begin dispatching groups of Rangers to actively helping any wastelander that is moving through our territory. Hopefully this will continue to show outsiders that we can be trusted."

MSR_Support_Local_Settlement:0 "Support Local Settlements"
MSR_Support_Local_Settlement_desc:0 "With the success we are seeing in helping those within our territorial borders, many nearby settlements have asked us to help support them against possible raids. I didn't expect them to reach out to us so quickly, but that doesn't mean it is a bad thing. I am just happy that they are starting to see us as a group to seek help from."

MSR_Incentivize_Trade:0 "Incentivize Trade"
MSR_Incentivize_Trade_desc:0 "Trade talks have begun but are moving at a snail's pace. Nearby settlements are still unwilling to conduct major trade with us, as they feel we don't have much to offer them. Because of this, I have authorized that we allow the trade of some of our nonessential tech for these much-needed resources."

MSR_Support_Local_Caravans:0 "Support Local Caravans"
MSR_Support_Local_Caravans_desc:0 "With trade now growing between us and a number of outside settlements, it would be wise to start giving out support for some of the caravans that help us conduct our business. If we show them how much we appreciate their work, they will be more likely to continue operating with us."

MSR_Become_A_Force_For_Good:0 "Becoming a Force for Good"
MSR_Become_A_Force_For_Good_desc:0 "It is high time we truly show the wasteland that we are a force for good. No longer will we bring unwarranted harm to those who peacefully cross our paths. From here on out, we will strive to show the wasteland that there is still good within the heart of every Equestrian."

MSR_A_Fork_In_The_Road:0 "A Fork in the Road"
MSR_A_Fork_In_The_Road_desc:0 "Even though so much good has been done by the Applejack Rangers, there is still a lot of work to do. However, I am unsure if I want to continue doing all this work. I need some time to think."

MSR_Manehattan_Treaty_Organization:0 "Manehattan Treaty Organization"
MSR_Manehattan_Treaty_Organization_desc:0 "With how harsh the Equestrian Wasteland can be, the idea of a multi-settlement treaty organization centered within the ruins of Manehattan could benefit many. With this type of treaty organization, we could ensure both military and economic cooperation with those who wish to join. It won't be easy to create. However, with enough time it could bring stability to this region."

MSR_Offer_Membership_To_Others:0 "Offer Membership to Others"
MSR_Offer_Membership_To_Others_desc:0 "With the charter draft and the paperwork almost complete, it is now time to move to the next step of this plan. We will send out a number of envoys to some of the surrounding settlements, asking if they wish to join the MTO. Hopefully we can gain a few new member-settlements."

MSR_Create_A_Mutual_Defense_Pact:0 "Create a Mutual Defense Pact"
MSR_Create_A_Mutual_Defense_Pact_desc:0 "Now that we have a number of member-settlement in the MTO, it is time to gather the representatives of each settlement and start getting to work. Our first order of business is to ensure that each settlement is ready in the event that another member-state is attacked. Because if one state is attacked, all states are attacked."

MSR_Joint_Military_Exercises:0 "Joint Military Exercises"
MSR_Joint_Military_Exercises_desc:0 "In order to make sure that each settlement is ready for the event of a sudden invasion, we have devised a number of joint military exercises to be conducted. It will be hard on them at first, as many of these settlements have never had anything more than a militia force to protect them. By the time we are done, those militia forces will come ready to face anything."

MSR_Aid_In_Re_Industrialization:0 "Aid in Re-Industrialization"
MSR_Aid_In_Re_Industrialization_desc:0 "Assisting with the construction of industry within each member-settlement is major factor in ensuring their survival. Therefore, we have agreed to lend a number of our scribes to help the settlements understand what it will take to create an industrial base from scratch."

MSR_Manehattan_Recovery_Program:0 "Manehattan Recovery Program"
MSR_Manehattan_Recovery_Program_desc:0 "The survival of each member-settlement is key to the survival of the MTO as a whole. Because of this, we have decided to lend whatever resources we can spare to every member-settlement. It may put a strain on our resources for some time, but it will benefit all of us greatly in the long run."

MSR_Keeping_The_Flame:0 "Keeping the Flame"
MSR_Keeping_The_Flame_desc:0 "There is still so much that can be done to improve the situation within Manehattan. I can't stop, won't stop, until I ensure that the safety of all who live here is guaranteed."

MSR_Carrying_On_A_Memory:0 "Carrying on a Memory"
MSR_Carrying_On_A_Memory_desc:0 "Though Applejack is all but a memory for me now, her dream of helping those in need still resides within. I never realized the good we could have done if we followed her example instead of hiding away. It is time we carry that dream in honor of her, so that its message can be seen by all of the Equestrian Wasteland."

MSR_Talk_With_Crossroads:0 "Talk with Crossroads"
MSR_Talk_With_Crossroads_desc:0 "Crossroads has been very vocal about her animosity towards some of the decisions I have made. She says that the Applejack's Rangers are changing too rapidly, causing us to alienate many former Steel Rangers. I understand her concerns, and I will have to discuss with her that change comes with a cost, but the benefit always outweighs it. Hopefully she'll agree."

MSR_Remember_Our_Oaths:0 "Remember Our Oaths"
MSR_Remember_Our_Oaths_desc:0 "When the Steel Rangers were first created, we all took an oath. It stated that we would protect and defend Equestria and its citizens. Since the Great War, that oath has been lost to time, replaced with a more twisted version. For too long we have followed this false oath and it is high time we rid ourselves of it and return to our roots. It is time we remember our oaths to Equestria and, once again, swear to protect her. Even in her darkest hour."

MSR_Embracing_Outsiders:0 "Embracing Outsiders"
MSR_Embracing_Outsiders_desc:0 "We have had outsiders within our ranks for some time now, but it seems like there are still some who hold animosity towards them. It is shameful to see so called 'Brothers in Hooves' distrust one another and put their lives in possible jeopardy. We must show them that these outsiders are not only to be trusted, but embraced, as if they were an old friend."

MSR_The_Spirit_Of_Honesty:0 "The Spirit of Honesty"
MSR_The_Spirit_Of_Honesty_desc:0 "Applejack represented the spirit of honesty as she was always willing to tell the truth, no matter what. She went above and beyond to help not just her friends, but anypony that needed help. If we want to continue to show the wasteland that the Applejack's Rangers are their friends, we must strive to follow her example."

MSR_An_Unwavering_Vision:0 "An Unwavering Vision"
MSR_An_Unwavering_Vision_desc:0 "We have come so far in the past couple of years, more than I thought we ever would. Our fledgling organization, built from the ashes of the Steel Rangers, has become a beacon of hope within the wasteland. No more will the ponies of the wasteland be fearful of what may lay around the corner, as we will be there to help them along the way. There is still a long road ahead of us, but I believe that if we stay true to our vision, nothing will stand in our way."

MSR_Investigate_Arbu:0 "Investigate Arbu"
MSR_Investigate_Arbu_desc:0 "Some of our scouts have begun to notice strange things occurring at Arbu. Let's hope their post-op reports can shed some light on the situation."

MSR_Take_Out_The_Empire:0 "Take Out the Empire"
MSR_Take_Out_The_Empire_desc:0 "The Empire's power within the Manhattan region has been growing for quite some time. Their forces have lined against our borders and threatened our sovereignty in the past. Because of this, we had put plans in place to preemptively strike their positions with the hopes of taking their forces out in one fell swoop."

MSR_Crush_The_Manehattan_Raiders:0 "Crush the Manehattan Raiders"
MSR_Crush_The_Manehattan_Raiders_desc:0 "The Manhattan Raiders have been a threat in the region for too long. Their blatant disregard for pony life is something we won't let stand. It is high time that the swift hoof of justice is brought down on them and their reign of terror ended."

MSR_Deal_With_The_Rain_Raiders:0 "Deal with the Rain Riders"
MSR_Deal_With_The_Rain_Raiders_desc:0 "The Rain Riders continue to be a danger to anypony traveling within the area. If we wish to ensure the safety of all travelers coming to the Manehattan ruins, we will have to take them out for good."

MSR_Passing_The_Torch:0 "Passing the Torch"
MSR_Passing_The_Torch_desc:0 "It was unexpected to say the least; I never thought I would even be considered for elder. But with how fast thing are changing around here, some are looking towards me as a voice of reason. It will be tough task to endure, but hopefully by then end of it, I can bring some balance back to the Applejack's Rangers."

MSR_Necessary_Compromise:0 "Necessary Compromise"
MSR_Necessary_Compromise_desc:0 "Steelhooves may have initially had the right idea; working to make the Steel Rangers a force for good. But he tried to change too many things too quickly, causing rifts to form within our ranks. If we wish to keep ourselves from collapsing, I need to make some compromises to appease the hardline groups."

MSR_Realism_Not_Idealism:0 "Realism, Not Idealism"
MSR_Realism_Not_Idealism_desc:0 "Steelhooves was so focused on changing the Steel Rangers into something new that he lost sight of what was going on in front of him. His new policies were pushing away many of his former supporters while forcing us to give up more of our resources. Though his intentions were noble they were in no way grounded in reality."

MSR_Remember_Our_Mission:0 "Remember Our Mission"
MSR_Remember_Our_Mission_desc:0 "We cannot hold ourselves to such old-world ideas. As much as our oaths still hold meaning to our cause, they also have us swear loyalty for a nation that does not exist anymore. The only thing we can hold ourselves to now is collecting and securing harmful technology from those who wish to use it for malice."

MSR_Bring_Back_The_Outcasts:0 "Bring Back the Outcasts"
MSR_Bring_Back_The_Outcasts_desc:0 "When Steelhooves began reforming the Steel Rangers into the Applejack's Rangers, he forced a large number of non-supporters out. In doing this, we lost a lot of ponies with both valuable skill and equipment. Steelhooves was far too harsh on many of them, and most should be allowed to return, if they so desire."

MSR_The_Supremacy_Of_Steel:0 "The Supremacy of Steel"
MSR_The_Supremacy_Of_Steel_desc:0 "The Equestrian Wasteland is unforgiving and steel, not honesty, is the best policy within the wasteland. It takes more than sharing your true emotions to survive: you need guts, grits, and a lot of guns. We are called the Steel Rangers for a reason, and it wasn't because we shared our feelings with each other."

MSR_A_Reasonable_View:0 "A Reasonable View"
MSR_A_Reasonable_View_desc:0 "Steelhooves thought that he could bring forth change in a matter of weeks, but all it did was divide us even more. If I not had been chosen to be Elder when I did, the Applejack's Rangers would not have lasted more than a year. I may not be as idealistic as Steelhooves, but I have still set the Applejack Rangers on the right path."

MSR_Bucklyn_Defense_Initiative:0 "Bucklyn Defense Initiative"
MSR_Bucklyn_Defense_Initiative_desc:0 "The need to protect ourselves is great, but something we can't do alone. Even with all the changes we have enacted, we are still not the most liked group within the wasteland. I think it is high time we create a defense initiative to ensure the safety of Bucklyn."

MSR_Convince_Others_To_Join:0 "Convince Others to Join"
MSR_Convince_Others_To_Join_desc:0 "In order for this initiative to succeed, we need other settlements to act as buffer states for us. But that requires them to willingly joins us. That something they might not agree to. To remedy that, we'll make sure that they won't have any kind of a choice in the matter."

MSR_Offer_Military_Protection:0 "\"Offer\" Military Protection"
MSR_Offer_Military_Protection_desc:0 "Now that we were able to 'convince' all of these settlements to join our little defense pact, we can begin to move troops into their territories. This is to ensure that our 'allies' are properly protected from any outside threat. It would be a shame to see them get pushed over by some raider group, now wouldn't it?"

MSR_Create_A_Technology_Tax:0 "Create a Technology Tax"
MSR_Create_A_Technology_Tax_desc:0 "With the safety of our 'allies' ensured, we can begin to focus on creating some reforms. Our first order of business is to institute a technology tax within their territories. This will be to help compensate for the fact that we are deploying so many of our Rangers outside of Bucklyn. It will in no way hurt their economic situation, as long as they comply."

MSR_Seize_Illegal_Technology:0 "Seize \"Illegal\" Technology"
MSR_Seize_Illegal_Technology_desc:0 "Seems like some of our 'allies' have been secretly hoarding technology from us. This will not do at all. How are we supposed to trust each other if them do things like this? Looks like I am going to have to send some Rangers in to seize these stockpiles and ensure that our allies don't go behind my back again."

MSR_Occupy_Strategic_Locations:0 "Occupy Strategic Locations"
MSR_Occupy_Strategic_Locations_desc:0 "It has been confirmed that some of our 'allies' have locations of strategic importance within their territories. These locations could prove useful to us given that we are allowed to take them over. It should be a relatively simple task, but we must also be prepared regardless. In case they refuse."

### Industry Recover ###

MSR_A_City_In_Ruins:0 "A City in Ruins"
MSR_A_City_In_Ruins_desc:0 "Manehattan was once one of the largest centers of trade and commerce in Equestria. Now it sits in ruin, slowly wasting away. It's about time somepony changed that. Thanks to our technological know-how and military might, we will begin to rebuild this glorified junk yard into a prosperous community."

MSR_Repairing_Bucklyn_Cross:0 "Repairing Bucklyn Cross"
MSR_Repairing_Bucklyn_Cross_desc:0 "Bucklyn Cross may be our home, but it is also a logistical nightmare. Almost every road in and out of the area is covered by some sort of hazard. If we wish to be able to carry out operations with relative ease, we need to make sure our supply and communication lines are fully open to us."

MSR_Securing_Bucklyn_Proper:0 "Securing Bucklyn Proper"
MSR_Securing_Bucklyn_Proper_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our supply routes within Bucklyn Cross, it would be wise to move towards cleaning up Bucklyn proper. Doing so would allow us to not only expand our area of operation within Manehattan, but also expand our ability to trade."

MSR_Rebuilding_Rail_Lines:0 "Rebuilding the Rail Lines"
MSR_Rebuilding_Rail_Lines_desc:0 "Bucklyn was once home to a system of commuter trains that allowed ponies to move around the city with ease. There is much potential if we could find a way to repair these rails lines. Doing so would not only increase our ability to move supplies around, but also allow for the rapid deployment of our troops."

MSR_Arms_Salvaging:0 "Arms Salvaging"
MSR_Arms_Salvaging_desc:0 "A Steel Ranger is nothing more than a glorified civilian without their equipment. In order to make sure each and every one is properly armed and equipped, we must increase our efforts in salvaging pre-war military warehouses."

MSR_Hiring_Weaponsmith:0 "Hiring Weaponsmiths"
MSR_Hiring_Weaponsmith_desc:0 "As our military strength continues to grow so does our need for more equipment. Scavenging isn't going to meet our expanding needs like it once did. To fill this growing need, we have begun to hire weaponsmiths to aid in the production of new equipment."

MSR_Vigilant_Recycling:0 "Vigilant Recycling"
MSR_Vigilant_Recycling_desc:0 "Waste not, want not. From toasters to broken MEWs, every piece of scrap technology can be broken down into useable parts. To ensure that we will never be wanting of vital components, we shall recyvle every bit of broken technology we encounter."

MSR_Foundries_Of_Steel:0 "Foundries of Steel"
MSR_Foundries_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Our military-industrial complex has grown to such a point that not even the weaponsmiths can keep up. On order to remedy this, we have begun converting some of the old factories into centers of arms production. Never again will we have to scavenge the leftovers of the old world for new equipment."

MSR_Metailurgy_Reborn:0 "Metallurgy Reborn"
MSR_Metailurgy_Reborn_desc:0 "As the Steel Rangers continue to grow so does our need for more advanced metals. Luckily for us, we have been able to find a number of holotapes containing information on the science of metallurgy. Thanks to these, we should be able to produce more refined alloys."

MSR_Stripping_World_Facilities:0 "Stripping Old-World Facilities"
MSR_Stripping_World_Facilities_desc:0 "If we are to produce more advanced equipment, we must maintain a large stockpile of advanced components. However, the only way to do that is by stripping every pre-war government complex and research facility we find. It will be highly dangerous work, but our need for these parts outweigh the risks."

MSR_Back_Yard_Forages:0 "Back Yard Forges"
MSR_Back_Yard_Forages_desc:0 "If we wish to continue our efforts in rebuilding Manehattan, we need to first build up an industrial base. Though it will start off rather small, given enough time we could soon turn Manehattan back into the industrial center of Equestria."

MSR_Civilian_Labor_Corp:0 "Civilian Labor Corp"
MSR_Civilian_Labor_Corp_desc:0 "There are a number of ponies who have made their way to Manehattan in the hopes of seeking shelter with us. Athough we loath the idea of doing charity work, a number of these ponies hold skills that we are sorely lacking in. Because of this, we have begun to hire them on to complete projects that our own scribes couldn't care less about."

MSR_City_Of_Steel:0 "City of Steel"
MSR_City_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Bucklyn, even in the ruined state it is, can still serve a great purpose to us. Many of the old structures were made from a multitude of metals that we could easily reuse for our own benefit. Thanks to this, we are certain we will never run out of scrap to use."

MSR_Rebuilding_Old_Canneries:0 "Repairing the Old Canneries"
MSR_Rebuilding_Old_Canneries_desc:0 "Reconstruction is going slow, but steady. Our industrial base has taken roots, which has allowed us to look into expanding it. Thankfully, there are some old canneries nearby that are still in decent condition. With a little TLC, we should be able to bring them back into working order."

MSR_Repairing_The_Generators:0 "Repairing the Generators"
MSR_Repairing_The_Generators_desc:0 "Electricity is crucial to our survival. It is what keeps the factories running, the communications flowing, and our weapon systems operating. Therefore, to keep up with the ever-increasing demand, we must expand our operations to repair and rebuild any power generator we find."

MSR_Restoring_Water_Plant:0 "Restoring the Bucklyn Water Plant"
MSR_Restoring_Water_Plant_desc:0 "The Mare River is by no means a safe source of drinking water. Fortunately, Bucklyn just so happens to be home to a sizable water treatment facility. With a bit of work, we could have it up and running again in no time."

MSR_Buckyln_Reborn:0 "Bucklyn Reborn"
MSR_Buckyln_Reborn_desc:0 "It has taken us quite some time, but it was worth all of the hardships. Thanks to the efforts of every Steel Ranger and wasteland volunteer, the once desolate ruins of Bucklyn have been transformed into a thriving community. No longer are we hiding away in Bucklyn Cross, fearful of what lay in the ruins. The days of barely scraping enough supplies together to survive is a distant memory. Our factories produce new equipment for us, while our repaired roads allow for ease of trade with the outside. The industrial might of Equestria is waking once more, and the Steel Rangers shall be there to guide it every step of the way."

### Army Tree ###

MSR_Army_Reorganization:0 "Army Reorganization"
MSR_Army_Reorganization_desc:0 "Thanks to all the political infighting, our armed forces have become somewhat neglected over the past years. This is something we cannot allow. We must reorganize and reevaluate our forces if we hope to still be able to put up a fight."

MSR_Combat_Log:0 "Pre-War Combat Logs"
MSR_Combat_Log_desc:0 "A wise pony once said that 'if one wants to define the future, they must study the past.' Study the past we shall. Our vast collection of pre-war combat logs provide us with valuable information involving numerous types of military engagements. With these logs, we can better understand what the militaries of the past did right and what they did wrong. From there, we should be able to formulate new plans that better fit the battlefields of today."

MSR_Raider_Wars:0 "Raider Wars"
MSR_Raider_Wars_desc:0 "Given our plethora resources and weapons we are a prime target for raider factions. Though some of these wars have been costly, they have given us valuable amounts of combat data that we can review. With each new combat log, we can come up better plans and tactics to use against these varying groups."

MSR_Combat_Simulation:0 "Combat Simulations"
MSR_Combat_Simulation_desc:0 "Though it will never be as good as experiencing a battle firsthoof, the use of simulations has been a proven military training tactic since before the Great War. And they can still provide us with the necessary training needed if these certain situations are to arise during combat."

MSR_Reverse_Engineering:0 "Reverse Engineering"
MSR_Reverse_Engineering_desc:0 "Thanks to the hard work of our scribes, we now have a better understanding of our magical energy weapons. Hopefully this will allow us to better streamline our production of them along with reducing their overall production cost."

MSR_Old_World:0 "Old World Efficiency"
MSR_Old_World_desc:0 "Why try to fix something if it isn't broken? That's the thought when it comes to whether we should upgrade our magical energy weapons. We have been using the same MEWs for centuries now and they have more than proved themselves reliable."

MSR_New_World:0 "New World Design"
MSR_New_World_desc:0 "Though our MEWs of old have done us well, they are beginning to show their age. Luckily, our scribes have been prototyping an advanced MEW weapon system. This step towards the future is essential to keeping ourselves in the fight, though it does mean we will have to move more resources toward their production."

MSR_Routine_Maintenance:0 "Routine Maintenance"
MSR_Routine_Maintenance_desc:0 "Our power armor is centuries old and could easily break down in combat. To try and prevent this, the scribes have implemented a routine maintenance program for all our power armor. With this in place our armor will always be combat ready."

MSR_Streamlined_Parts:0 "Streamlined Parts"
MSR_Streamlined_Parts_desc:0 "Some of the scribes have concluded that we could easily streamline the production of power armor, given enough time. This would greatly increase the number of units we can produce. However, it would also decrease the reliability of the power armor as well as compromise some of its integrity."

MSR_Reinforced_Alloys:0 "Reinforced Alloys"
MSR_Reinforced_Alloys_desc:0 "Some of the scribes have found a way to reinforce our power armor with a new type of super alloy. With it amalgamated with the power armor, the hull integrity would increase significantly, although it would make producing power armor more costly."

MSR_PBF:0 "Pony's Best Friend. Reinvented, again."
MSR_PBF_desc:0 "Robots were once a vital part of the Equestrian war effort. But now many now lie in scrap piles, no better than buckets of rust. It might be beneficial to start looking into researching them once again, as they could prove a valuable asset."

MSR_Legion_Of_Steel:0 "Legions of Steel"
MSR_Legion_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Robots are nothing more than the perfect cannon fodder. Make their design simple enough and you could field thousands of them. All one have to do is sit back and watch them soften up the enemy before sending in the more valuable troops in to mop up."

MSR_Mobile_Weapon_System:0 "Mobile Weapon Systems"
MSR_Mobile_Weapon_System_desc:0 "Robronco had the right idea when creating heavy assault robots like the sentinels. Their increased armor and complement of weaponry more than outweigh their costly production. Having these mobile tanks on our side would give us a massive advantage on the battlefield."

MSR_Promoting_Initiates:0 "Promoting Initiates"
MSR_Promoting_Initiates_desc:0 "With our ponypower reserves starting to falter, we have decided to hasten the promotion of many of our initiates. They may have not fully finished their training, but this influx will hopefully fill in a number of gaps we have. It may not be the most ideal situation, but we don't really have time to bicker about it."

MSR_Wasteland_Conscription:0 "Wasteland Conscription"
MSR_Wasteland_Conscription_desc:0 "In order to keep up our strength we need to have a constant flow of new recruits. However, the problem is that the number of our foals coming of age into the Steel Rangers is still low. Because of this, we have authorized the conscription of 'outsiders' who show interest and/or loyalty to us, in the hopes of bolstering our numbers."

MSR_Multirole_Training:0 "Multirole Training"
MSR_Multirole_Training_desc:0 "We have recently come across some old military texts that talk about something called 'Multirole Training.' This training was supposed to allow soldiers to do each other's jobs incase certain specialists were 'incapacitated.' With this in mind, we shall immediately begin to implement this 'Multirole Training' for our initiates and knights. Hopefully this will increase the number of combat ready troops we have."

MSR_Rangers_Lead_The_Way:0 "Rangers Lead the Way"
MSR_Rangers_Lead_The_Way_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of both the Paladins and Scribes, we have been able to completely overhaul how our armed forces function. They are better trained and better equipped to deal with what the wasteland throws at them. Now nothing can stand in the way of the Steel Rangers. Ad Victoriam!"

### Aviation Tree ###

MSR_Taking_To_The_Skies:0 "Taking to the Skies"
MSR_Taking_To_The_Skies_desc:0 "Pegasi and griffins thought they were the only ones who could tame the sky. Now it is our turn. Thanks to some 'generous' wrecks left behind by the Grand Pegasus Enclave, we have begun work on researching flight for the flightless."

MSR_Repairing_Old_Airfields:0 "Repairing Old Airfields"
MSR_Repairing_Old_Airfields_desc:0 "Bucklyn had very little in the way of a functioning air field, as it was only a part of the greater city of Manehattan. However, we got lucky, as the old borough did have a small municipal airport for pre-war civilian craft. With a bit of work we could get it back up and running."

MSR_Secure_The_Skies:0 "Securing the Skies"
MSR_Secure_The_Skies_desc:0 "Complete air dominance is key for any military victory, at least it did in the old world. While it may not be the biggest concern today, there is still sound logic to it."

MSR_Focus_On_Fighters:0 "Focus on Fighters"
MSR_Focus_On_Fighters_desc:0 "Due to resource constraints, we are greatly limited in our plane production capability. Because of this, we will focus on building fighters over CAS."

MSR_Dominate_The_Skies:0 "Dominate the Air-War"
MSR_Dominate_The_Skies_desc:0 "With our air power slowly increasing, no longer will the Pegasi control the sky unabated. Our brand new fighters will soon take to the air, showing that the Steel Rangers are not to be underestimated."

MSR_Flying_Fortresses:0 "Flying Fortresses"
MSR_Flying_Fortresses_desc:0 "Fighters are good, but if we really want to get an edge in the air war, we need to go big. Though they may be costly to produce, these airships are just what we need to gain the upper hoof."

MSR_Support_Our_Troops:0 "Support our Troops"
MSR_Support_Our_Troops_desc:0 "Undoubtedly, our soldiers are the true concern of any military action. Whether from the ground or from the air, we must make sure they are always supported."

MSR_Focus_On_CAS:0 "Focus on CAS"
MSR_Focus_On_CAS_desc:0 "Due to resource constraints, we are greatly limited on our plane production capability. Because of this, we will focus on building CAS over fighters."

MSR_Death_From_Above:0 "Death from Above"
MSR_Death_From_Above_desc:0 "Sturdy, accurate, and very effective against ground targets, dive bombers are perfect for dealing with any ground target. Our enemies won't know what hit them as we shower them from above with explosives."

MSR_Strategic_Bombing:0 "Strategic Bombing"
MSR_Strategic_Bombing_desc:0 "Sometimes the way to deal with the enemy is to decimate everything that aides their war effort. This is where the genius of strategic bombing comes in. With these on our side, the enemy will surely be crushed."

MSR_birds_of_steel:0 "Birds of Steel"
MSR_birds_of_steel_desc:0 "Our air force has come a long way: never did we imagine that we would take to the skies ever again. It is such an amazing sight watching our planes take off towards their target mission. With our pilots covering our backs, we will surely become unstoppable."

MSR_wall_off_bucklyn_cross_desc:0 "The densely packed buildings of Inner Bucklyn alreayd form a near-perfect defense.

A scrap wall here, a roadblock there, and soon enough, the city will have become a fortress!"

MSR_conscript_everyone:0 "Conscript EVERYONE"
MSR_conscript_everyone_desc:0 "Threats against the contingent seem to be crawling out of every piece of rubble in this Celestia-damned city! As much as we may try, we simply don't have enough ponies to deal with all of them.

MSR_cw_support_other_elders:0 "Support Traditional Elders"
MSR_cw_support_other_elders_desc:0 "Cottage Cheese, Steel Hooves, and River Autumn were perfect examples of just how far off from our original mission we have gone.

MSR_cw_anti_aj_operations:0 "Commence Anti-Traitor Operations"
MSR_cw_anti_aj_operations_desc:0 "Though our war with the traitors may be over, there still seems to be a number of traitor holdouts and pockets that remain.

#MSR.1.desc:0 "MSRpony Tower. A luxury hotel, known for housing the Ministry of Arcane Science's ManehatMSR Hub. When Balefire began raining from the sky, those ponies working within the Hub were some of the first to know. Orders came in from Canterlot to fire the prototype megaspell Celestia One at Roam, capital of the Zebra empire. Knowing that ManehatMSR would be a primary target, the ponies of the Ministry had to make a choice. They could follow their orders and focus on casting the megaspell, or ignore their orders and focus on using the ManehatMSR Emergency Broadcasting System to warn the residents of the city. There wouldn't be enough time to do both, and the seconds were ticking down."

MSR.1.title:0 "The Survivors"
MSR.1.desc:0 "We never expected it to come to this. The city around us burned while we just stood there, doing nothing. Eventually a stallion, possibly a commanding officer, began yelling at us, trying to get us to do something. But with the world ending right infront of us, what can we do?"

MSR_elections.1.title:0 "An Interesting Find!"
MSR_elections.1.desc:0 "Scouts have brought back a particularly interesting piece of pre-war equipment. It could only reasonable be described as some kind of advanced terminal, similar to the thousands we've seen before all throughout the wasteland; what makes this one special, however, is it's apparent lack of any damage whatsoever, made all the more astounding by the fact that the building it was found in was in imminent danger of completely crumbling into the river.\n\nStandard procedure would be to hand the device over to the scribes for immediate research, but the Elder feels that the scribes have gotten too \"uppity\" as of late, and that they should be \"put back in their damn place\". Withholding this technology from them could easily serve as a threat to them: behave, or your supply will be cut. On the other side of things, we need not take such drastic measures by breaking tradition; Simply giving the terminal to the scribes may be enough to appease them for the time being..."
MSR_elections.1.a:0 "Withhold it."
MSR_elections.1.b:0 "Conceed it to the scribes."

MSR_elections.2.title:0 "A Rare Appearance"
MSR_elections.2.desc:0 "The news spread quickly throughout Bucklyn Cross; Star Paladin Steelhooves was here! The ancient Steel Ranger typically spent most of his time away from our headquarters, off on assignment or some other venture, but today was different. He had come to speak directly with Elder Cottage Cheese, regarding something happening out west. If the the yelling heard from the Elder's office was anything to go by, Steelhooves deeply objected to whatever it was.\n\nFirst to spead were the rumors, then the murmurs of discontent from the more \"open-minded\" members of the contingent as more and more came to decide that if someone as old and wise as Paladin Steelhooves objected to the Elder, surely they should follow his lead."

Until today. Should the vote succeed, control of the Manehattan Contingent will be passed on to the next highest ranking member, that being Star Paladin Steelhooves, who has yet to comment on the entire situation. Initiates, Paladins, and Knights alike wait with baited breath as they await the count to roll in, knowing full well that this will determine the future of the Rangers for years to come..."

MSR_elections.3.title:0 "Political Gridlock"
MSR_elections.3.desc:0 "In a shock to all, the vote has been stopped, and not by either Cottage Cheese or Steelhooves' supporters, but by a formal protest from a group of scribes led by River Autumn. They were able to find a bizzare clause in the code that much like the vote of no confidence, has never been invoked. So long as a pony is speaking and standing in formal protest to a vote, it cannot go through, and with such a large group of them, they are able to rotate out and prolong the results of the vote ad infinitum. Nopony has entered or exited the council room in hours, it's just the provisional council and the scribes..."

MSR_elections.4.title:0 "A Means to an End"
MSR_elections.4.desc:0 "Standing over the ashes of what once was Elder Cottage Cheese, a smile began to form on Autumn River’s face. Though this was only the beginning of her plan and there would be much turmoil down the road. She felt that she was wholly justified in her action against her former elder. The Steel Rangers were a broken and corrupt group of technophiles. Only through the guidance of Elder River Autumn, would they ever know true prosperity."
MSR_elections.4.a:0 "Long live River Autumn..."

### Cottage Events ###

MSR.7.title:0 "Staying on the Beaten Path"
MSR.7.desc:0 "It was a good feeling knowing that the contingent still believed in honoring tradition. Even with all the political divisions caused by Steelhooves and Autumn River, the Steel Rangers of the Manehattan Contingent stood true to their oaths to Equestria. Now with power firmly back in the hooves of those who know how to properly wield it, Elder Cottage Cheese wasted no time getting things back into order. "
MSR.7.a:0 "OK"

MSR.8.title:0 "The Fate of the Council"
MSR.8.desc:0 "Though I must thank the council for so graciously letting me continue on as the Elder of the Manehattan Steel Rangers, as well as dealing with the more boring day to day tasks required to govern this contingent. Their need to constantly question some of the things I do is beginning to annoy me. This constant questioning could become a problem later down the road, and ridding myself of them would save me the headache. However, the provisionary council has become quite popular and dissolving the council could cause unrest among the lower ranks. Both choices have equal consequences, but in the end, the best option would be to..."
MSR.8.a:0 "Keep them around."
MSR.8.b:0 "Get rid of them!"

MSR.9.title:0 "The Visionary and the Despot"
MSR.9.desc:0 "Star Paladin Steelhooves and Scribe Autumn River are both ticking time bombs. Their extremist views have already rocked this contingent enough and it's about high time we deal with them. The only problem is, I can't deal with them both. I need help from one of them, in other to rid myself of the other. Steelhooves, though an outspoken critic of our current way of doing things, is one of the oldest living members of the Steel Rangers. His experience and knowledge in the field make him very popular among the other Knights and Paladins. Keeping him around would easily help boost my popularity among the soldiers. However, Scribe River Autumn holds great sway among many of the scribes, as well as some of the paladins. And even though I know she sees me as an old coot, unfit for Elder, she could greatly increase our technological advantage over the rest of the wasteland. This is a tough choice to make, but I must ultimately choose to side with..."

MSR.9.b:0 "River Autumn"

MSR.11.title:0 "Increase Tech Scavenging"
MSR.11.desc:0 "We need to increase our efforts in recovering technology. The amount of old world tech still out there is numerous, but our ponypower is few. Because of this, we can't focus on collecting everything we find. So, in order to keep ourselves from being spread to thin, we have to... "
MSR.11.a:0 "The Weapons"
MSR.11.b:0 "The Power-Armor"

MSR.13.title:0 "A Discovery"
MSR.13.desc:0 "Despite the stereotype surrounding ponies of his age, Cottage Cheese often found it difficult to fall asleep at night. On nights like these, the Elder spent his time reading, pouring over logs found by his scouts, or news bulletins from a world 200 years dead, hoping to find a lead for any piece of interesting technology. Tonight’s reading came from Blueberry Sabre’s contingent in Fillydelphia, a selection of logs and data that had been pulled from the terminals in the Stable-Tec HQ.\n\nCottage was about to call it a night when he spotted it: \"§d03.22.1033 - APB to SCT§!\". To most, it would look like nothing more than a simple email between employees, but Cottage Cheese instantly recognized the two ponies involved, Apple Bloom and Scootaloo, two of the three founders behind Stable-Tec, and if past experiences were anything to go on, when these two spoke, clues leading to tech were sure to be found.\n\n\"§dHeya Scoots,\nI know you're probably busy with figuring out where we'll be putting our Severyana Stables, but I'm just keeping you up to date with Project Crusader, like you asked me to. My team and I have got all the hardware figured out, and I've got a rough weight estimate for you, a little over 300 tons, so most of it will have to be transported by rail or a fleet of pegasi when we get to installing it. Rainbow's got me working on an extra system, she wants something that'll let us hook a regular pony up to it, on account of her \"not wanting a freaky robot running the weather\". I think I'm gonna reach out to Pinkie, see if I can rope some of her memory mages into this. If all goes well, we should be able to upload a pony's mind to it and have them run it instead of the computer.\n\n- Apple Bloom\n\nP.S. Twilight reached out to me, she wants one of these things now, guess RD told her about it.§!\"\n\nCottage Cheese sat with his eyes wide, he could barely believe it, a computer that could upload a pony into it? It sounded impossible to him, yet somehow he knew it was real, and it was out there, just waiting for him to claim it..."
MSR.13.a:0 "\"I need it.\""

MSR.14.title:0 "A Helping Hoof?"
MSR.14.desc:0 "When I first came across the documents detailing the crusader maneframe, I couldn't believe it. If I were a younger pony, the idea of becoming immortal, by putting both your mind and soul into a computer, would sound beyond absurd. But now, as I grow closer to deaths door, the idea sounds like it could just be my ticket to achieving glory. With my mind and soul in a crusader maneframe, I could continue to lead this contingent and act as a guide for future generations.\n\nHowever, with such little time left for me, I am finding it harder to work on this by myself. I could ask some scribes to help me out, thus giving me more time. However, I don't trust all of the scribes in this contingent.

What is so important to send so many Paladins and Knights away. I can't have that, not at all. But on the other hoof, I can't keep wasting the little time I have left; hoping that the small number of teams we currently send out will stumble across something useful.

After a couple hours of tense silence, they group of Steel Rangers finally came across the marked sewer grate. Soon, the Steel Rangers found themselves standing in front of a large cog shaped door with the number 29 painted on it. The door slowly slid open while the Rangers watched in anticipation for any possible danger; only to be met with an unnerving silence. The Steel Rangers felt hesitant to enter, but the lead Paladin scoffed at them before trotting in. The Rangers crept their way through hallways, checking their EFS for any potential threats; only to still be greeted with same unnerving silence. The point pony continued to follow the schematics that she had downloaded into her helmet, quietly guiding the team to their destination. Eventually, the Ranger team found themselves standing outside a small, sealed hatch. With a bit of grit and some help from their power armor, the Rangers were able to breach the hatch. Cottage Cheese began to smile as the Rangers entered the hidden room. "Elder, is this what you were looking for?" the lead Paladin asked. There was a pause before Cottage responded.

There is no way that you could just integrate yourself into the maneframe; you would only be uploading you mind, but not your soul. Without this Black Book and whatever magic, it holds, you would be missing a crucial part of yourself. However, I feel hesitant to use this abominable form of magic; no pony should ever use such dark things. But, if I don't use it, my ultimate goal will never be complete.

MSR.118.title:0 "Hidden Stockpiles" 
MSR.118.desc:0 "Two knights stood guard as a group of scribes worked quickly to try and pry off a cluster wall panels off. There was one panel left to go, but it was giving them the most trouble. After a bit of trial and error, they were able to get enough leverage and the panel popped right off. Hidden behind it laid a sizable stash of highly valuable equipment: emp grenades, spark guns, magical energy rifles, mines, and even a minigun. The group took one look at the stockpile and immediately began to dig in. Once they were satisfied with their newfound armaments, the group immediately headed off to meet up with the others."
MSR.118.a:0 "Let’s hope this is enough."

MSR.119.title:0 "Secure the Economy"
MSR.119.desc:0 "All across Bucklyn, teams of Autumn loyalists began to move towards their targets under the cover of darkness. Their goal, to secure all economic assets and trade routes within the territory. They hoped that if they could cut these vital avenues of supplies, the rest of the Contingent would shortly fall into line. All of the sudden, a series of flares lit up the night sky signaling that it was time to commence the attack. Loyalists throughout Bucklyn swiftly moved towards their designated targets, hoping to secure them before the alarm could be raised. Though the element of surprise was on their side, the Loyalists would still face stiff resistance that would bog down the operation and cause a staggering amount of damage."

MSR.122.desc:0 "The scribes looked nervously at one another as they waited for their Elder to arrive. They had no idea why they had been summoned, but they felt like nothing good was going to come from this. Eventually Elder River Autumn entered the room and slowly made her way to the makeshift stage. Her voice was calm and collected as she began to explain why they were all here. She explained the situation before them and said that they had two options; stay in the room or leave. The scribes sat in silence as each of them began to weigh their options; none daring to make the first move. Eventually, two of them decided to stand up and leave the room; much to the dismay of the others. A third one began to stand up, but was promptly pulled back down by his colleagues. Once River Autumn was satisfied that no more scribes were going to stand, she thanked them for their time and promptly left."
MSR.122.a:0 "Such a shame about those two."

MSR.123.title:0 "Battle at the Armory"
MSR.123.desc:0 "The armory guards had only seconds to react as the sounds of charging hoof steps moved towards them. Just as they got behind their makeshift barricades, a massive wave of Autumn Loyalists came into their view. The guards began to open fire on the attackers; gunning down pony after pony. However, they soon started to realize that for every pony they killed, three more were right behind them. The guards continued to put up a desperate defense, but soon found themselves being overrun. At this point the guards decided that it would be best to fully retreat; but as they began to flee, they found their exit blocked by River Autumn herself. The guards, now fully surrounded, knew that their only option was to surrender. In a brief, but bloody, battle River Autumn had secured the entirety of the Steel Rangers weaponry."
MSR.123.a:0 "Now nothing can stand in my way."

MSR.124.title:0 "Silver Tongued Elder"
MSR.124.desc:0 "The Knights and Squires waited patiently for the arrival of their so called ‘Elder’. Many felt disgusted that she dared to give herself that title, especially after rumors went around that she was the one that killed Elder Cottage Cheese. Eventually, Elder River Autumn made her way into the briefing room; calmly taking a seat in front of them. The atmosphere of the room was extremely tense, but River Autumn continued to wait patiently. Eventually some of the Knights spoke up and began to vent their opposition towards her. As he spoke, many of the other within the room started to show their agreement with the numerous arguments. Once they were finished, River Autumn took a deep breath and began to offer her counter-arguments. In a matter of minutes, she was able to silence the room and soon enough had many of the Knights agreeing with her. When all was set and done, River Autumn had earned the trust of the majority of Knights."
MSR.124.a:0 "Well that was easier than I thought."

MSR.125.title:0 "Meeting with Paladins"
MSR.125.desc:0 "If looks could actually kill, River Autumn would most certainly be dead. She expected the Paladins to not be friendly towards her, but the way they stared daggers at her made her doubt herself a little. With a heavy sigh, she attempted to explain her side of the story as to why she claimed the right to be Elder. She pointed out everything the previous Elder did that went against the Steel Rangers and how he tried to play with dark magic in order to obtain immortality. Though her argument was very compelling, the Paladins began to leave the room in droves, not wishing to hear their former elder be slandered by her. By the end of her spiel, River Autumn found that only a hoof full of Paladins had remained."
MSR.125.a:0 "Well, that could have gone better."

MSR.126.title:0 "Public Disturbences"
MSR.126.desc:0 "A pair of Enforcers patrolled the corridors of Bucklyn Cross, keeping an eye and ear out for any potential ‘threat to stability’. As they continued on their route, they were stopped by a young initiate who immediately told the pair that something was happening in the cafeteria. With haste, the Enforcers trotted their way over to figure what was the cause of commotion. When they eventually entered the cafeteria, the pair saw an older Knight standing on one of the tables ranting. The Knight was going on a tangent about how the others had betrayed their oaths and that the Steel Rangers were on the brink to destruction. As he continued to rant, the two Enforcers quickly moved in to apprehend the Knight. The Knight, taken by surprise, tried to fight against his soon to be captors. He got a couple of strong hits off, but he soon found himself being overpowered by the pair of Enforcers. Once the pair had beaten him into submission, they dragged him out of the cafeteria and down into the brig."
MSR.126.a:0 "He should have known better."

MSR.127.title:0 "Night of the Long Knives"
MSR.127.desc:0 "River Autumn was in her office reviewing the daily influx of paperwork as per her normal routine. She lamented having to deal with all of this paperwork, but she also knew that she couldn’t let it pile up. As the hours slowly crawled by, she eventually glanced over at the wall mounted clock and noticed that it was almost time. With that in mind, River Autumn sat her paperwork down, poured herself a glass of bourbon, and turned on the radio. While the soft sounds of smooth jazz began to fill the room, another sound could be heard from just outside her door. Sporadic bursts of gunfire, yelling, and screams began to echo throughout the corridors of Bucklyn Cross. The noise continued to grow louder and louder until it sounded like Bucklyn cross was being engulfed in a war. And while most ponies would attempt to sound the alarm; River Autumn stayed put, continuing to sip away at drink. When the noise eventually died down, River Autumn finished off her glass, turned off the radio, and went straight back to work."
MSR.127.a:0 "Another problem solved."

MSR.128.title:0 "Out with the Old"
MSR.128.desc:0 "Steelhooves, to my surprise, wasn’t the hardest stallion to find. The report states that he and some of his remaining followers were caught trying to sabotage one of the forward communications arrays. Following a brief firefight, they were captured and were promptly sent to be executed for their traitorous crimes. The surprising thing in this report is how it stated that Steelhooves required a couple extra rounds to be put down. And I’m not saying one or two extra 5.56 mm rounds, but a couple extra .50 BMG rounds to the head. From there they go on to mention that when they were preparing to bury their bodies, the group assigned had forgotten the shovels and was forced to go get them. By the time they had returned, they saw that Steelhooves' corpse was missing from the pile. They chalk it up to some ballsy scavenger trying to steal some quick caps, but I have my doubts."
MSR.128.a:0 "Well, at least he's gone..."

MSR.129.title:0 "Ending the 'Rebellion'"
MSR.129.desc:0 "River Autumn slowly moved around the group of captured rebels, carefully eyeing each one of them. When she felt that she was done, she returned to her position in front of them and prepared to speak. In a clear and concise tone, she told the rebels the choice that laid before each of them. They could either repent for their misdeed and be allowed to live, but as a lowliest of conscripts. Or, they could stay true to their oaths and meet their end at the barrels of a firing squad. At first, it seemed that every one of the rebels would stay true to their oaths. However, as the tension within the room continued to grow, some of the rebels began to crack. At first it was only one or two, but by the end, more than a quarter of the rebels had stepped forward asking for forgiveness. The rest of the rebels stared in shock at their former comrades as they were shuffled away to their certain demise."

Somepony who would maintain the status quo while ensuring the safety of the nation above all else.

Somepony like me.\n\nFrom this day forth, a new nation shall rise from the ashes of Manehattan. A nation built to succeed where others had failed. Yes, there will be those who look upon us as just another experiment doomed to fail. Another clique in the wasteland trying to prove itself worthy of admiration. But we shall show each and every one of them that we are stronger than their ill-conceived notions. We have a great aim before us; a mighty work of rebuilding ourselves and our lives, of our life in common, of our economy, of our culture. It will be a daunting task; one marked with many hardships.

  POLITICS_COTTAGEGOD_DESC:0 "§GHello, Citizens of Manehatten. You do not know me, save for maybe by title, but rest assured I have only your best interests in mind. I am Elder Cottage Cheese, the last Elder of the Manehatten Contingent, and I am now your eternal and faithful guardian.

  POLITICS_RIVERAUTUMN_DESC:0 "Little is known about River Autumn's rise to power, beyond the conditions surrounding it being suspicious at best. Many whisper of her being a murderer, a Brotherslayer, and far worse, though none would dare do so where she could overhear.\n\nHer rulership has already proven to be stern, in a manner far more threatening than her predecessor ever could of achieved. Those who disappoint her are quick to be cast down the ranks. That is, if they are fortunate. Those who truly anger her often have a habit of either disappearing or being found guilty of a severe offence against the Contingent.\n\nAs the Steel Rangers move into the future, they will grow to fear their own leader more than any threat that could exist outside of their fortified walls."
  
  POLITICS_GRANDMARSHALRIVER_DESC:0 "Grand Marshal Autumn is considered one of the most feared mares in the Equestrian Wasteland. Her rule is in equal measure benevolent and absolute, with few daring to even slightly step out of line lest they attract their rulers wrath. With a power armored army under her command and an ambition greater than any of her predecessors could dream of, her rule will have an impact on Equestria for generations to come."
  
  POLITICS_STEELHOOVES_DESC:0 "Elder Steelhooves is hooves-down the oldest member of the entirety of the Steel Rangers, along with one of the most respected. He was outside of Canterlot on the day that the world ended, aiding in the evacuation efforts in Zebratown and surrounding communities. When the Pink Cloud poured down from the ruins of the capital city above, Steelhooves would be among those directly exposed to the necromantic toxin.\n\nAs a direct result of his exposure, he became fused to his armor and was turned into a Canterlot ghoul. This has rendered him effectively immortal and extraordinarily difficult to kill, leading to him becoming a valued advisor and soldier to the Steel Rangers in equal measure.\n\nAs a result of his experiences out in the Wasteland, Steelhooves has grown more idealistic than what many expected. His return to the Manehatten Contingent was quickly followed by a political power struggle, one which he has come out on top of. Now, he seeks to reform the Steel Rangers to follow the ideals of their founder and his once-upon-a-time lover, Ministry Mare Applejack."
  
  POLITICS_CROSSROADS_DESC:0 "Where Steelhooves was idealistic, Crossroads is practical. Where he was ambitious, she is realistic. Where he was an awe-inspiring figure, she is little more than just another Steel Ranger.\n\nHowever, she has found herself now in command of the Manehatten Contingent. Her policies are often more conservative than her predecessors, which has made her an appealing option to many of those who still held sympathies towards Elder Cottage.\n\nThough the future looks uncertain for the Steel Rangers, she is determined to make sure that they come out intact on the other side."
