MSR_The_New_Dev:0 "The New Elder"

MSR_Talk_With_Paladins:0 "Talk with the Paladins"
MSR_Talk_With_Paladins_desc:0 "Many of the Paladins within this contingent weren’t too happy when they heard that I was chosen as them next Elder. I think it would be wise to talk with them before they do something brash."

MSR_Meet_With_Scribes:0 "Meet with the Scribes"
MSR_Meet_With_Scribes_desc:0 "The scribes have always been partial to the politics of the Steel Rangers; focusing more on their work than what’s going on around them. If I could convince them to support me, it could help in legitimizing my position."

MSR_Exile_Extremists:0 "Exile the Extremists"
MSR_Exile_Extremists_desc:0 "The Steel Rangers has always been home to a number of unsavory characters; ones who would rather do as they please without interference. I can’t allow these types within our ranks and know that we must rid ourselves of them before they attempt to push back. It will be tuff to let so many Rangers go, but it must be done if we wish to change who we are."

MSR_Rid_The_Old_Ways:0 "Rid of the Old Ways"
MSR_Rid_The_Old_Ways_desc:0 "The old ways have held us back for a long time; preventing us from becoming something more. From our distrust of outsiders, to our complete obsession with technology. It is time we rid ourselves of these ideals and look towards something new."

MSR_Rally_The_Rangers_desc:0 "With the majority of the Manehattan contingent on my side, it is time we rally them to our cause; only then can we begin to bring change to the Steel Rangers.

MSR_Break_The_Chains:0 "Break the Chains"
MSR_Break_The_Chains_desc:0 "The ‘Chain That Binds’ is something that only brought more harm than good, when in it was implemented. My years in the military showed me that a flexible command structure works more efficiently than one that is rigid."

MSR_Change_Our_Approach:0 "Change our Approach"
MSR_Change_Our_Approach_desc:0 "Whenever we dealt with any kind of situation our approach always seemed to barge in and do as we please. I think it is time we find a more diplomatic approach to solving an issue and only start barging in when that option has truly failed."

MSR_Our_Original_Mission:0 "Our Original Mission"
MSR_Our_Original_Mission_desc:0 "We turned away almost any outsider who begged for our help, because they weren’t one of us. We refused to shelter those who needed protection, leaving them to fend for themselves. I say, no more. For the first time in almost 200 years, we shall cast aside what made us who we are and find a new purpose in life. From this day forth, we shall dedicate ourselves to our original mission; protecting the ponies of Equestria from those who wish to do them harm."

### Industry Recover ###

MSR_A_City_In_Ruins:0 "A City in Ruins"
MSR_A_City_In_Ruins_desc:0 "Manehattan was once one of the largest centers of trade and commerce in Equestria. Now, it sits in ruin; slowly wasting away. It’s about time somepony changes that. Thanks to our technological knowhow and military might, we will begin to rebuild this glorified junk yard into a prosperous community."

MSR_Repairing_Bucklyn_Cross:0 "Repairing Buckyln Cross"
MSR_Repairing_Bucklyn_Cross_desc:0 "Bucklyn Cross may be our home, but it is also a logistical nightmare. Almost every road in and out of the area is covered by some sort of hazard. If we wish to be able to carry out operations with relative ease, we need to make sure our supply and communication lines are fully open to us."

MSR_Securing_Bucklyn_Proper:0 "Securing Bucklyn Proper"
MSR_Securing_Bucklyn_Proper_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our supply routes withing Bucklyn Cross; it would be wise to move towards cleaning up Bucklyn proper. Doing so would allow us to not only expand our area of operation within Manehattan, but also expand our ability to trade."

MSR_Rebuilding_Rail_Lines:0 "Rebuilding the Rail Lines"
MSR_Rebuilding_Rail_Lines_desc:0 "Bucklyn was once home to a system of commuter trains that allowed ponies to move around the city with ease.

Doing so, would not only increase our ability to move supplies around, but also allow for the rapid deployment of our troops."

MSR_Arms_Salvaging:0 "Arms Salvaging"
MSR_Arms_Salvaging_desc:0 "A Steel Ranger is nothing more than a glorified civilian without their equipment. So, in order to make sure each Steel Ranger is properly armed and equipped, we must increase our efforts in salvaging pre-war military warehouses."

MSR_Hiring_Weaponsmith:0 "Hiring Weaponsmiths"
MSR_Hiring_Weaponsmith_desc:0 "As our military strength continues to grow, so does out need for more equipment. Scavenging isn’t going to meet are expanding needs as it once did. So, we have begun hiring weaponsmiths to aid in the production of new equipment."

MSR_Vigilant_Recycling:0 "Vigilant Recycling"
MSR_Vigilant_Recycling_desc:0 "Waste not, want not. From toasters to broken MEW’s; every piece of scrap technology can be broken down into useable parts. Making sure we recycle every piece of broken technology we come across, will ensure we never run out of these vital components."

MSR_Foundries_Of_Steel:0 "Foundries of Steel"
MSR_Foundries_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Our military-industrial complex has grown to such a point that not even the weaponsmiths can keep up. So, to remedy this, we have begun converting some of the old factories into centers of arms production. Never again will we have to scavenge the leftovers of the old world for new equipment."

MSR_Metailurgy_Reborn:0 "Metallurgy Reborn"
MSR_Metailurgy_Reborn_desc:0 "As the Steel Rangers continue to grow, so does our need for more advanced metals. Lucky for us, we have been able to find a number of holotapes containing information on the science of metallurgy. Thanks to these, we should be able to produce more refined alloys."

MSR_Stripping_World_Facilities:0 "Stripping Old-World Facilities"
MSR_Stripping_World_Facilities_desc:0 "If we want to be able to produce more advanced equipment, we must maintain a large stockpile of advanced components. However, the only way to do that is by stripping every pre-war government complex and research facility we come across. It will be highly dangerous work, but our need for these parts outweigh those costs."

MSR_Back_Yard_Forages:0 "Back Yard Forages"
MSR_Back_Yard_Forages_desc:0 "If we wish to continue our efforts in rebuilding Manehattan, we need to first build up an industrial base. Though it will start off rather small, given enough time we could soon turn Manehattan back into the industrial center on Equestria."

MSR_Civilian_Labor_Corp:0 "Civilian Labor Corp"
MSR_Civilian_Labor_Corp_desc:0 "There are a number of ponies who have made their way to Manehattan in the hopes of seeking shelter with us. And even though we loath the idea of doing charity work, a number of these ponies hold skills that we are sorely lacking in. Because of this we have begun hiring them on to start doing work that our own scribes could care less about."

MSR_City_Of_Steel:0 "City of Steel"
MSR_City_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Bucklyn, even in the ruined state it is, can still serve a great purpose to us. Many of the old structures were made from a multitude of metals that we could easily reuse for our own benefit. Thanks to this, we are certain we will never run out of scrap to use."

MSR_Rebuilding_Old_Canneries:0 "Repairing the Old Canneries"
MSR_Rebuilding_Old_Canneries_desc:0 "Reconstruction is going slow, but steady. Our industrial base has taken roots which has allowed us to look into expanding it.

MSR_Repairing_The_Generators:0 "Repairing the Generators"
MSR_Repairing_The_Generators_desc:0 "Electricity is crucial to our survival. It is what keeps the factories running, the communications flowing, and our weapon systems operating. So, in order to keep up with the ever-increasing demand, we must continue to rebuild and repair any power generator we come across."

MSR_Buckyln_Reborn:0 "Bucklyn Reborn"
MSR_Buckyln_Reborn_desc:0 "It has taken us quite some time, but it was worth all of the hardships. Thanks to the efforts of every Steel Ranger and wasteland volunteer, the once desolate ruins of Bucklyn have been transformed into a thriving community. No longer are we hiding away in Bucklyn Cross, fearful of what lay in the ruins. No longer are we barely managing to scrape together enough supplies to get by on. Our factories produce new equipment for us; while our repaired roads allow for ease of trade with the outside. The industrial might of Equestria is waking once more, and the Steel Rangers shall be there to guide it every step of the way."

### Army Tree ###

MSR_Army_Reorganization:0 "Army Reorganization"
MSR_Army_Reorganization_desc:0 "Thanks to all the political infighting, our armed forces have become somewhat neglected over the past years. This is something we cannot have. We must reorganize and reevaluate our forces if we hope to still be able to put up a fight."

MSR_Combat_Log:0 "Pre-War Combat Logs"
MSR_Combat_Log_desc:0 "A wise pony once said that “if one wants to define the future, they must study the past.”. And study the past we shall. Our vast collection of pre-war combat logs provides us with valuable information involving numerous types of military engagements. With these logs, we can better understand what the militaries of the past did right and what they did wrong. From there, we should be able to formulate new plans that better fit the battlefields of today."

MSR_Raider_Wars:0 "Raider Wars"
MSR_Raider_Wars_desc:0 "Given our plethora resources and weapons, we are a prime target for raider factions. Though some of these wars have been costly, they have given us valuable amounts of combat logs that we can review. With each new combat log, we can come up better plans and tactics to use against these varying groups."

MSR_Combat_Simulation:0 "Combat Simulations"
MSR_Combat_Simulation_desc:0 "Though it will never be as good as experiencing a battle firsthoof. The use of simulations has been a proven military training tactic since before the Great War. And they can still provide us with the necessary training needed if these certain situations are to arise during combat."

MSR_Reverse_Engineering:0 "Reverse Engineering"
MSR_Reverse_Engineering_desc:0 "Thanks to the hard work of our scribes, we now have a better understanding of our magical energy weapons. Hopefully this will allow us to better streamline our production of them; along with reducing their overall production cost."

MSR_Old_World:0 "Old World Efficiency"
MSR_Old_World_desc:0 "Why try to fix something if it isn’t broken? That’s the thought when it comes to whether we should upgrade our magical energy weapons. We have been using the same MEW’s for centuries now and they have more than proved themselves reliable."

MSR_New_World:0 "New World Design"
MSR_New_World_desc:0 "Though our MEW’s of old have done us well, they are beginning to show their age. Luckily, our scribes have been prototyping an advanced MEW weapon system. This step towards the future is essential to keeping ourselves in the fight, though it does mean we will have to move more resources towards their production."

MSR_Routine_Maintenance:0 "Routine Maintenance"
MSR_Routine_Maintenance_desc:0 "Our power armor is centuries old and could easily breakdown in combat. In trying to prevent this, the scribes have implemented a routine maintenance program for all of our power armor. With this in place, our armor will always be combat ready."

MSR_Streamlined_Parts:0 "Streamlined Parts"
MSR_Streamlined_Parts_desc:0 "Some of the scribes have concluded that we could easily streamline the production of power armor, given enough time. This would greatly increase the number of units we can produce. However, it would also decrease the reliability of the power armor, as well as, compromise some of its integrity."

MSR_Reinforced_Alloys:0 "Reinforced Alloy’s"
MSR_Reinforced_Alloys_desc:0 "Some of the scribes have found a way to reinforce our power armor with a new type of super alloy. With this alloy added into the power armor, the hull integrity would increase significantly. Though it would make producing power armor more costly."

MSR_PBF:0 "Pony’s Best Friend. Reinvented, again."
MSR_PBF_desc:0 "Robots were once a vital asset to the Equestrian war effort. However, many now lie in scrap piles collecting rest. It might be beneficial to start looking into researching them once again, as they could prove a valuable asset."

MSR_Legion_Of_Steel:0 "Legions of Steel"
MSR_Legion_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Robots are nothing more than the perfect cannon fodder. Make their design simple enough and you could field thousands of them. Then all you have to do is sit back and watch them soften up the enemy before sending in the more valuable troops in to clean up."

MSR_Mobile_Weapon_System:0 "Mobile Weapon Systems"
MSR_Mobile_Weapon_System_desc:0 "Robronco had the right idea when creating heavy assault robots like the sentinels. Their increased armor and compliment of weaponry more than outweigh their costly production. Having these mobile tanks on our side would give us a massive advantage on the battlefield."

MSR_Promoting_Initiates:0 "Promoting Initiates"
MSR_Promoting_Initiates_desc:0 "With our ponypower reserves starting to faulter, we have decided to hasten the promotion of many of our initiates. They may have not fully finished their training, but this influx will hopefully fill in a number of gaps we have. It may not be the most ideal situation, but we don’t really have time to argue about that."

MSR_Wasteland_Conscription:0 "Wasteland Conscription"
MSR_Wasteland_Conscription_desc:0 "In order to keep up our strength we need to have a constant flow of new recruits. However, the problem is that the number of our foals coming of age to join the Steel Rangers is still low. Because of this, we have authorized the conscription of ‘outsiders’ who show interest and/or loyalty to us, in the hopes of bolstering our numbers."

MSR_Multirole_Training:0 "Multirole Training"
MSR_Multirole_Training_desc:0 "We have recently come across some old military texts that talk about something called ‘Multirole Training’. This training was supposed to allow soldiers to do each other’s jobs incase certain specialists were ‘incapacitated’. With this in mind, we shall immediately begin implementing this ‘Multirole Training’ into our regular training courses. Hopefully this will increase the number of combat ready troops we have."

MSR_Rangers_Lead_The_Way:0 "Ranger Lead the Way"
MSR_Rangers_Lead_The_Way_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts both the Paladins and Scribes, we have been able to completely overhaul how our armed forces function. They are better trained and better equipped to deal with what the wasteland throws at them. Now nothing can stand in the way of the Steel Rangers. Ad Victoriam!"

Orders came in from Canterlot to fire the prototype megaspell Celestia One at Roam, capital of the Zebra empire. Knowing that ManehatMSR would be a primary target, the ponies of the Ministry had to make a choice.
