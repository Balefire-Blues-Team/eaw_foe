 unity_start_1_desc:0 "The Impelled Metamorphosis Potion (I.M.P.) was a consumable megaspell capable of transforming a normal pony into a powerful alicorn. The Ministry of Arcane Sciences created it with the intention of creating super soldiers, who would then contribute to an overwhelming Equestrian victory in the Great War. Unfortunately, the project was still in the testing phase when the War came to a sudden end."
 
 unity_start_2:0 "The End of the World"
 unity_start_2_desc:0 "As megaspells poured from the sky, the ponies within Maripony quickly found themselves at the center of danger. The facility took a direct hit, resulting in widespread damage and those within being trapped by the security systems. Unfortunately for them, what was occuring within the facility was even more horrific than what was occuring outside of it."
 
 unity_start_3:0 "The Wasteland"
 unity_start_3_desc:0 "Equestria was gone, but the Unity survived. Eventually, they decided to see if anything else did too."
 
 unity_start_4:0 "Face Off"
 unity_start_4_desc:0 "The Unity was made of many minds. Of those many minds, three truly stood out above the rest. And those three didn't always agree..."

 goddess_slaver_1:0 "Worker Caste"
 goddess_slaver_1_desc:0 "We can't be expected to do all of the work, especially not that which is far beneath Us. By forcing Wastelanders to labor away for Us, We may focus on more important matters."
 
 goddess_shared_1:0 "Cleaning House"
 goddess_shared_1_desc:0 "Maripony is located in the once scenic Splendid Valley. Unfortunately, this blasted land has seen better days. Hellhounds and tainted abominations now roam throughout it, making it one of the deadliest places in the Wasteland. If We hope to do anything with this land, it'll need to be cleared out, and the vermin eliminated."
 
 goddess_shared_2:0 "The Ministry's Remains"
 goddess_shared_2_desc:0 "Across the river to the southwest there lies an old Stable that appears to be home to the descendants of Ministry of Arcane Sciences personnel. They have not been idle in the last two centuries, but have instead been continuing to pursue their objective from before the War: To further Equestria's understanding of science and magic. Perhaps We could approach them peacefully. After all, We contain within Us Twilight Sparkle herself."
 
 goddess_shared_3:0 "The Stable Dweller"
 goddess_shared_3_desc:0 "Out in the Wasteland, there is a singular pony who has caused Us more trouble than anypony else. Seemingly indestructable, immensely powerful, and with a determination that was rare even during the War. This little pony has been a thorn in Our side for some time, killing Our alicorns with impunity and interferring with Our plans constantly. This 'Littlepip' must be dealt with, but perhaps We can convince her to work with Us."
 
 ###RED EYE ALLIANCE###
 
 goddess_canon_reach_out_to_filly:0 "Into the Mind of a Monster"
 goddess_canon_reach_out_to_filly_desc:0 "To the east lies a city of smog and misery, propped up by an abused population of slaves working day and night. In charge of it all is Red Eye, a stallion with a vision of a rebuilt Equestria, no matter the cost. While his vision does not align well with Our own, We may still find a use for an arrogant visionary."
 
 goddess_canon_seize_hope:0 "Seizing Hope"
 goddess_canon_seize_hope_desc:0 "To secure Our further expansion, we must seize the region known as West Hope. Unfortunately, We doubt the settlers living there will give it up without a fight."
 
 goddess_canon_send_alicorns:0 "Military Cooperation"
 goddess_canon_send_alicorns_desc:0 "With Red Eye providing Us parts of his workforce, it makes sense to provide him with some of Our soldiers to make up for it"
  
 goddess_canon_integrate_newts:0 "Subsuming the New Arrivals"
 goddess_canon_integrate_newts_desc:0 "Red Eye's slaves continue to resist joining Us in true Unity. Their voices are causing Us quite a headache. We shall forcibly overwhelm their thoughts and steal pieces of their minds away from them."
 
 goddess_canon_mind_wargames:0 "The Minds of Mighty Warriors"
 goddess_canon_mind_wargames_desc:0 "It turns out that some of Red Eye's slaves were raiders and tribal warriors. No wonder they have resited Us so strongly. Their memories and talents shall serve Us well."
 
 goddess_canon_perfect_children:0 "Perfecting Our Children"
 goddess_canon_perfect_children_desc:0 "We now hold many memories of fighting all sorts of fearsome Wasteland beasts, some of which make even the abominations of Splendid Valley seem harmless by comparison. Many of these beasts have such exceptional qualities that We can't help but wonder whether or not they could be learned from in order to improve Our alicorns."
 
 goddess_canon_whole_of_mind:0 "One With the Unity"
 goddess_canon_whole_of_mind_desc:0 "The resisting slaves have finally given in. Their minds have become one with Our own, and their full knowledge as well. We shall make sure to put their skills to good use."

 goddess_canon_put_to_work_desc:0 "Those slaves which are unfit to join Us in the Unity may instead be put to work in Our gem mines. All beings shall have a place in Our new world!"
 
 goddess_canon_slave_roads:0 "Roads to Damnation"
 goddess_canon_slave_roads_desc:0 "Even if Our slaves have found all of the crystals they could reach within Our mines, they can still prove themselves useful in another way. Much of Splendid Valley remains difficult to navigate, so We shall put them to work in building brand new pathways and clearing away old rubble."
 
 goddess_canon_industry:0 "The Splendid Factories"
 goddess_canon_industry_desc:0 "You know, sometimes We have a moment of brilliance. This is one of those. Our slaves shall be put to work building new factories! We'll even go a step forward and make them work in these factories as well! Soon, Our industry shall rival that of even Red Eye's."
 
 goddess_canon_clockwork:0 "Clockwork Conversion"
 goddess_canon_clockwork_desc:0 "Previously, We simply dunked unicorns into I.M.P. whenever We really felt like it, but that changes today! With a proper plan, and quotas for every week, We will hopefully be able to work much more efficiently!"
 
 goddess_canon_industrial_coop:0 "Industrial Assistance"
 goddess_canon_industrial_coop_desc:0 "Fillydelphia's industry is the envy of the Wasteland! However, Our own industry is unfortunately lacking in many ways. Perhaps Red Eye would be open to industrial cooperation with Us?"
 
 goddess_canon_trading_IMP:0 "Trading in Secrets"
 goddess_canon_trading_IMP_desc:0 "Red Eye wants to know how I.M.P. works, We want to know about a lot of other stuff. While we both loathe to part with our secrets, this is the logical way forward."
 
 goddess_canon_Reds_success:0 "Success at the Cathedral"
 goddess_canon_Reds_success_desc:0 "We wouldn't believe it, if the eyes of Our own alicorn hadn't seen it: Red Eye has managed to reverse engineer I.M.P., and is now capable of producing it himself. This prevents a large problem for Us, and We must more cautious around the slaver moving forward."
 
 goddess_canon_Reds_fruits:0 "Fruits of Our Alliance"
 goddess_canon_Reds_fruits_desc:0 "Red Eye has decided to send Us a gift to show his commitment to the alliance. This gift came in the form of more ponies. We are sure We can find a use for them!"

 goddess_canon_preparing_for_endgame_desc:0 "The world is changing. The Enclave threatens to descend from the sky anyday now, and many major players are making moves all across the Wasteland.

 goddess_canon_interventionism:0 "Joint Excercises"
 goddess_canon_interventionism_desc:0 "Red Eye's army is one of the finest in the Wasteland. Even We could learn a thing or two from it! Actually, that gives Us an idea..."

 goddess_canon_emergency_dunking_1_desc:0 "The world of today is brutal and unforgiving. This will not be the case in Our world. Rather, Our world shall be perfect! Just like Us. However, to create this perfect world, We must first deal with those who would reject it."
 
 goddess_canon_emergency_dunking_3:0 "Converting the Conquered..."
 goddess_canon_emergency_dunking_3_desc:0 "It is a sad existence to be devoid of Our Unity, to not be a part of something greater. We shall do Our best to ensure that as few ponies as possible live that terrible life."
 
 goddess_canon_emergency_dunking_2:0 "...Until There is True Unity"
 goddess_canon_emergency_dunking_2_desc:0 "Someday, everypony shall be a part of Our Unity. This is a simple fact. So then why do ponies continue to resist Us, when their fate has already been determined?"
 
 goddess_canon_emergency_dunking_4:0 "§rWE ARE LEGION§!"

 goddess_canon_emergency_IMP_2:0 "Experimental Conversions"
 goddess_canon_emergency_IMP_2_desc:0 "We had an idea to improve the success rates by mixing an extra bit of magic into the IMP. We are confident that this shall work!"
 
 goddess_canon_emergency_IMP_3:0 "A Different Approach"
 goddess_canon_emergency_IMP_3_desc:0 "The conversion process seems to go much smoother if the pony does not resist Our will. We shall focus Our efforts towards trying to ease ponies into accepting Us, rather than simply forcing them to."
 
 goddess_canon_emergency_IMP_4:0 "§rThe Perfect Process§!"
 goddess_canon_emergency_IMP_4_desc:0 "The conversion process has been made just as perfect as Us! Casualties are drastically down, new converts put up much less resistance, and We are seeing more alicorns than ever before!"
 
 goddess_canon_kill_everyone:0 "Unity Ascendant"
 goddess_canon_kill_everyone_desc:0 "For centuries, ponykind has done little but struggle to survive in this harsh world. No longer! We, the embodiment of biological perfection, shall save ponykind! All shall be welcomed into Our Unity, and together, We shall all build a better world!"
 
 goddess_canon_kill_sunrise:0 "Help Red Eye take the East"
 goddess_canon_kill_sunrise_desc:0 "For the time being, Red Eye's interests are Our interests. If We were to dedicate Our efforts to clearing out his enemies in the east, We are certain he would be very appreciative. More importantly, this would also bring Us much closer to Manehatten."
 
 goddess_canon_kill_summberdale:0 "Tending to Our Own Back Yard"
 goddess_canon_kill_summberdale_desc:0 "Before We may turn our attention to the greater Wasteland, We must first ensure that Our own territory is secure. Raiders, monsters, and fools surround Us on all sides. They must be dealt with at once."
 
 goddess_canon_kill_canterlot:0 "Clearing Canterlot"
 goddess_canon_kill_canterlot_desc:0 "That nightmarish city of Canterlot has caused Us nothing but trouble. From Nightseer to the ghouls, the entire city is full of those who would resist Our Unity. No longer! If they shall not join Us, they shall perish!"
 
 goddess_canon_harbinger:0 "A Meeting With Harbinger"
 goddess_canon_harbinger_desc:0 "We must plot Our own course in the Wasteland, rather than being held back by an alliance that is doomed to fail. We shall seek to contact the Enclave, who will likely be the greatest power in the Wasteland before long."
 
 goddess_canon_merge_unity:0 "Invite Red Eye to the Unity"
 goddess_canon_merge_unity_desc:0 "The time has come for Us to give Red Eye the greatest gift of all: an invitation to join Us in the Unity. Hopefully he shall recognize what an honor this is. §RHowever, his own ignorance may lead to him rejecting Our offer.§!"
 
 goddess_canon_stick_redeye:0 "Stick with Red Eye"
 goddess_canon_stick_redeye_desc:0 "Red Eye has been a faithful ally thus far, and why should We expect that to change? Sure, he might be up to some questionable things, but surely he'll see the light of the Unity at the end of the day."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 goddess_redeye_1:0 "Material Aid"
 goddess_redeye_1_desc:0 "Red Eye is promising to give us ponies for Unity. In return, he is asking for the ability to use alicorns. By providing him with some IMP for his own use, he can make his own...though they will still be connected to us"
 
 goddess_redeye_3:0 "Worker Slaves"
 goddess_redeye_3_desc:0 "alicorns are beings of power and rule. They are not designed for factory work and construction. That leaves Us with a bit of a problem, as We need construction done. Red Eye though has a lot of slaves already. Though the ones he sends Us are destined to join Us, maybe We can ask for some that can actually do work"
 
 goddess_redeye_4:0 "Factory Construction"
 goddess_redeye_4_desc:0 "The MAS left Us with a lot of IMP after the war. However, if We wish to spread Unity to the entire world, we need more than just magic. We need weapons and infastructure. We need factories. Red Eye  has more tools and machines in Fillydeplhia than he can actually use. Why not ask him for some?"
 
 goddess_redeye_5:0 "Inviting Red Eye's Researchers"
 goddess_redeye_5_desc:0 "We have heard that one of Red Eye's researchers stands out above the rest. If we were to invitie him to Maripony, he would have immediate access to much more IMP than he would in Filidelphia"
 
 goddess_redeye_6:0 "Rads for the Rad Engine"
 goddess_redeye_6_desc:0 "Red Eye has created a mechanical engine that runs solely on radiation. As there is a lot of radioactive material in the wasteland, this is a perfect fuel source except for one thing: radiation is poison for ponies. But not for Us"
 
 goddess_redeye_7:0 "Going Around the Everfree"
 goddess_redeye_7_desc:0 "The Everfree is a dangerous place. One where even We don't dare tred. If We wish to open up supply lines with Red Eye, We will need to find a way around. After a quick visit, the locals won't object. Even if they do, what can they actually do about it?"
 
 goddess_redeye_8:0 "IMP Experimentation"
 goddess_redeye_8_desc:0 "Red Eye made sure to build a solid scientific base, a heritige he got from his old Stable. These researchers are trained in Earth Pony ways, and know technology, but Red Eye wishes to branch out. He has a team working to replicate Twilight Sparkle's work in making IMP. If We were to give him some, he would be likely to help us in kind"
 
 goddess_redeye_9:0 "Red Eye's Bodyguard"
 goddess_redeye_9_desc:0 "By putting an alicorn team close to Red Eye, We can more tightly bind our alliance"
 
 goddess_redeye_10:0 "An Army for Red Eye"
 goddess_redeye_10_desc:0 "Red Eye's army is large and powerful. By sending alicorn fighters to bolster his rank, Our alliance can become even stronger"
 
 goddess_unification:0 "Invite Red Eye to Unity"
 goddess_unification_desc:0 "It is time to give Red Eye our greatest gift. What happens next depends of what We have done, and what he will do"
 
 goddess_redeye_11:0 "Tenpony Tower"
 goddess_redeye_11_desc:0 "Tenpony Tower was the Manehatten hub of the Ministry of Arcane Science. The shields managed to hold off the megaspells, and is currently home to a semi-thriving society. "
 
 goddess_redeye_12:0 "The Enclave"
 goddess_redeye_12_desc:0 "Minutes before the end of the war, the Pegasi of Cloudsdale turned traitor and delcared independence from Equestria. Though Couldsdale was hit by the second megaspell, the rest of the Pegasi chose to follow their example and turn Rebel. For 200 years they stayed up there and created a cloud cover across all Equestria. They still maintain a massive military presence, and We will have to deal with them somehow. That being said, deal with doesn't need to be destructive"
 
 goddess_redeye_13:0 "Controlling the Sun"
 goddess_redeye_13_desc:0 "The MAS created a megaspell that could wield the sun like a weapon. With Our power, We should be able to do so much more"
 
 goddess_redeye_14:0 "Controlling the Weather"
 goddess_redeye_14_desc:0 "The Neighvarro facility is the home of the Single Pony Project. A single pony can use it to control the MASEBS towers that dot Equestria to control the weather. A single alicorn in the machine should be enough to allow Us to control the weather for ourselves."
 
 goddess_2:0 "The One True Goddess"
 goddess_2_desc:0 "Celestia is dead. Luna is dead. We are the One True Goddes. The Great and Powerful UNITY"
 
 goddess_redeye_c_1:0 "Technological Aid"
 goddess_redeye_c_1_desc:0 "Red Eye has people working on many technical marvels, including IMP. By working with him, We may be able to figure out how to make Our alicorns even better."
  
 goddess_redeye_15:0 "Cracking Secrets"
 goddess_redeye_15_desc:0 "Thanks to Our work with Red Eye, We have gone farther than even Twilight Sparkle could. With all this new knoweldge, We can finally work to fixing the sole flaw in our alicorns: The fact they are all female."
 
 
 
 
 ###INDEPENDENT###
 
 unity_slaver_1:0 "Supporting Independent Slavers"
 unity_slaver_1_desc:0 "While We will need a separate source of ponypower to make up for Our inability to breed, We must make sure that these sources stay subservient to Us. By supporting smaller slaver organizations We can ensure Our suppliers will remain under Our control."
 
 unity_slaver_2:0 "Laissez Faire"
 unity_slaver_2_desc:0 "These slavers have been doing their things for a very long time. By being "hooves off", we can capitalize on their OWn experience and let them do the work for Us."
 
 unity_slaver_3:0 "Expanding Their Output"
 unity_slaver_3_desc:0 "While the slaver organizations in Our sphere of influence are good, using alicorns to support their own troops will make them even more effective."
 
 unity_slaver_4:0 "Protecting Trade Routes"
 unity_slaver_4_desc:0 "By keeping the less organized or more bloodthirsty raider gangs out of Our way, we can both ensure more slaves reach Maripony, and other ponies grow less cautious around Us."
 
 unity_slaver_5:0 "Offer Unity"
 unity_slaver_5_desc:0 "The time has come for the slavers to leave Our sphere of influence and enter Our fold properly. By offering to make alicorns of the leaders, we can take over the leadership without anyone realizing that their old bosses aren't their old bosses anymore."
 
 unity_slaver_6:0 "Slaver Caste"
 unity_slaver_6_desc:0 "The time has come for the slaver gangs to leave Our sphere of influence and enter Our fold. By keeping the old bosses where they are and giving them marginal rewards, We can turn them into just another type of slave."
 
 unity_slaver_7:0 "In Their Place"
 unity_slaver_7_desc:0 "Though Our takeover of the slaver powers of the Wasteland was accepted by some, others have refused. It is time to take those who dare defy Our will, and put them in their place."
 
 unity_slaver_8:0 "Direct Control"
 unity_slaver_8_desc:0 "Slavers are notoriously fickle. Any promise of allegience won't last. If We wish to truly control the Wasteland through them, We must put Our people in charge."
 
 unity_slaver_9:0 "Priests of a New Goddess"
 unity_slaver_9_desc:0 "Alicorns are inherently superior to normal ponies. Most ponies know this and resent it. If We wish to properly control them, we need to put ponies on top that We can trust. Those who can hear Our words and obey."
 
 unity_slaver_10:0 "Mouthpiece of the Goddess"
 unity_slaver_10_desc:0 "Alicorns are inherently superior to normal ponies. All who look upon Us will bow down with awe. And any order We give shall be obeyed. \n Or else."
 
 unity_slaver_11:0 "Raid Efficiency Training"
 unity_slaver_11_desc:0 "With the power Our alicorns allow, We can increase the power of the slavers We employ."
 
 unity_slaver_12:0 "Holy Warriors"
 unity_slaver_12_desc:0 "Our fanatic followers fight with a ferocity unforseen. They do not just fight because they fear Us. They fight becaue they love Us."
 
 unity_slaver_13:0 "Overseers"
 unity_slaver_13_desc:0 "Though Our alicorns are precious, they allow Us to see everything they see. Taking them off Our fighitng forces to act as overseers with the slaver organizations under Our sphere will give Us tighter control over them."
 
 unity_slaver_14:0 "More Than Loyalty"
 unity_slaver_14_desc:0 "The preachers that We have sent have done better than We had ever expected. The ponies of these slaver groups, slave and slaver alike, truly believe in what they have been told. Many often offer themselves to Unity, rather than having to be dragged to it. This is not loyalty. This is fatih."
 
 unity_slaver_15:0 "Phase Out Old Guard"
 unity_slaver_15_desc:0 "Though for the most part the slavers under Our sphere have been following well. However, there are many in these groups whose rise to the top was halted by Our intervention. Getting rid of them should make Our full takeover much easier."
 
 unity_slaver_16:0 "A Better Class of Slave"
 unity_slaver_16_desc:0 "These slavers do not work for Us. They serve Us. Though they wear no chains, they are simply just more slaves."
 unity_slaver_17:0 "Forceful Conversion"
 unity_slaver_17_desc:0 "The zeal Our followers inspire does not spread easily. 200 years of knowing the old goddesses died has left the populace cynical. Those who we can not reach with words, we can reach with power."
 
 unity_slaver_18:0 "Political Unity"
 unity_slaver_18_desc:0 "We manage a large series of separate slaver organizations. Replacing their leaders tied them to Us. Now We need to bind them to each other."
 
 unity_slaver_19:0 "Expanding our Spheres"
 unity_slaver_19_desc:0 "Raiding for more slaves means We need more places to store them. We don't have the capacity at Maripony, so We just need to encourage Our slavers to capture more ground on which to construct holding pens and infastructure."
 
 unity_slaver_20:0 "Tighten the Noose"
 unity_slaver_20_desc:0 "Our slavers work under Our leadership. But We can not run everything, and much of the upper eschelon is still comprised of members of the old gang. We have worked to reduce their autonomy, but it is time for a final confrontation. Force the leadership to bow or die. "
 
 unity_slaver_21:0 "Lessons from Our New Members"
 unity_slaver_21_desc:0 "Having integrated the slavers that We had mostly left alone, We still need to figure out how to deal with the slaving base that We just created. We don't know much about this aspect, but with all the slavers We just brought under Our spell, We can easily pick up that slack."
 
 unity_slaver_22:0 "A Surplus of Slaves"
 unity_slaver_22_desc:0 "One of Our biggest issues is that alicons are not for labor. Alicorns are glorious beings of might and are not for such menial tasks. We do have a surplus of slaves though."
 
 unity_slaver_23:0 "Expanding Slave Output"
 unity_slaver_23_desc:0 "Alicorns are precious. We can not to use them on simple tasks. But by diverting a few to act as overseers, We can get more out of the slaves than We normally would."
 
 unity_slaver_24:0 "Expanding Slave Input"
 unity_slaver_24_desc:0 "Incorperating alicorns with the slaver raiding parties will increase the amount of slaves that Our slavers can capture."
 
 unity_slaver_25:0 "Wall of Meat"
 unity_slaver_25_desc:0 "Though Our alicorns are mighty, every one of them is precious. Though their magical shields can protect them, a physical shield of slaves will protect them even more."
 
 unity_slaver_26_desc:0 "Though are alicorns are mighty, Our foes are numerous. While their forces may be able to overwhelm Our alicorns on their own, by sprinkling slavers and trained slaves into Our forces, that numerical advantage will decrease drastically."
 unity_slaver_26:0 "Combined Arms"
 
 unity_slaver_27:0 "Expanded Dunking"
 unity_slaver_27_desc:0 "While Our slaves have always been used to bolster Our ranks, We have been lately diverting numbers to work on construction and production. It is time to undo that policy, and send more ponies to the vats."
 
 unity_slaver_28:0 "Slave Housing"
 unity_slaver_28_desc:0 "With all of the slaves We are bringing in, We need places to put them. Expanding the Maripony facility is a high priority."
 
 unity_slaver_29:0 "Creating More IMP"
 unity_slaver_29_desc:0 "With the increase of alicorns, We are starting to run out of pre-war IMP. Though We can not perfectly replicate the formula, We can get close enough."
 
 unity_slaver_30:0 "Administration"
 unity_slaver_30_desc:0 "Our slaving efforts have ensured that We may never dunk everypony. There will always be those that We can control directly. As such, We need to develop proper bureaucracy. Though We can use Our telekinetic threads instead of red tape, We still need to prepare for dealing with managers and administrators."
 
 unity_slaver_31:0 "How Far We've Come"
 unity_slaver_31_desc:0 "With Our control of the minor slavers of the Euqestrian Wasteland, We only have a few obstacles to overcome before We can finally unite all of Equestria once more. Though We still have far to go, We have come far, and it's time to celebrate."
 
 unity_slaver_32:0 "Our Greatest Rival"
 unity_slaver_32_desc:0 "We are not the first to try to unite the slavers of Equestria. There remains one major block to a full monopoly on slaves and slavers. It is time to deal with our old friend: Red Eye."
 
 unity_slaver_33:0 "Where No Slaver Has Gone Before"
 unity_slaver_33_desc:0 "Above the clouds sits the Grand Pegasus Enclave. Pegasi might not be as strong as earth ponies, but their wings allow them access to areas that it previously took alicorns to deal with. The Enclave is not an easy threat to deal with, as their cloud homes are mostly inaccessable, but Twilight Sparkle knew a few tricks to fix that. This war will not be easy, but when the dust settles, Our slave pens will need a new feature: Ceilings."
 
 unity_slaver_34:0 "Ancient Relics"
 unity_slaver_34_desc:0 "The last remnant of the wartime Equestrian government, the Steel Rangers, military arm of the Ministry of Wartime Technology, have been a thorn in our side for a very long time. It is time to show them who the new ruler of Equestria is."
 
 unity_slaver_35:0 "Twilight Sparkle's 2nd Greatest Creation"
 unity_slaver_35_desc:0 "Hidden in the Manehatten Hub of the Ministry of Arcane Science lies a weapon capable of calling down the sun itself as a weapon of mass destruction. The foals who occupy what is known as Tenpony Tower have no idea what they have. We should take it off their hooves."
 
 unity_slaver_36:0 "Wielding the Weather"
 unity_slaver_36_desc:0 "At Neighvarro is one of the only creations of the Ministry of Awesome: The Single Pony Project. If We can take that, We can put one of Our alicorns in charge of it. Though the alicorn will be in suspended animation, We will still have control of them, allowing Us to control the weather without leaving the world."
 
 unity_slaver_37:0 "Wielding the Sun"
 unity_slaver_37_desc:0 "With control of Tenpony Tower, the power of Our alicorns will allow Us to use Celestia Prime at will. With the power of the sun at Our beck and call, no one can stop Us."
 
 unity_slaver_38:0 "Slave Mistress of the Equestrian Wastes"
 unity_slaver_38_desc:0 "With all of the great powers in the Equestrian Wateland broken, there is no one who can stand in Our way."
 
 
 ###ALT PATH: PERFECT UNITY###
 
 goddess_perfection:0 "Perfect Beings"
 goddess_perfection_desc:0 "Alicorns are perfect in almost every way. They grow stronger in radition. They have magic beyond imagination. They can fly. They are Great and Powerful! They are truly the superior beings."

 goddess_dunking_1:0 "Perfect Unity"
 goddess_dunking_1_desc:0 "There are so many wastelanders out there who don't know the glory of Unity. We must not stop until they are all here with Us."
 
 goddess_master_1:0 "Wasteland Flyover"
 goddess_master_1_desc:0 "Though above the clouds the Enclave rules, under them We can fly with impunity. By passing over the Wasteland, We can get an idea of what We will have to deal with on Our quest to bring Equestria into Unity."
 
 goddess_master_2:0 "Prepare the Wings"
 goddess_master_2_desc:0 "Though alicorns are inherently powerful, and We have used them in skirmishes with the tainted monsters of Splended Valley, We have little experience with war. If We are to successfully bring all of Equestria to Unity, We must learn not just to fight, but to conquer."
 
 goddess_master_3:0 "Fortifying Our Home"
 goddess_master_3_desc:0 "Maripony is well situated in the middle of nowhere. However, the zebra's still saw fit to target it with a direct strike. It's a testament to pre-war Equestria that the facility survived, but it probably will not survive another strike. There's not much We can do about that, but We can take action to prevent the forces of the Wasteland from being able to invade Us. Setting up some defensive fortifications won't be very hard, and would protect Us against the ground forces that could penetrate Our magic shields."
 
 goddess_master_4:0 "Readying the Vats"
 goddess_master_4_desc:0 "If We are going to bring everypony in the Wasteland into Unity, We will need a lot more IMP."
 
 goddess_master_5:0 "Tainted Auxiliaries"
 goddess_master_5_desc:0 "Taint is comprised of the magical run-off, much of it prototype IMP. The creatures of Splended Valley come from the same magic that created Us, and though it won't be easy, We may be able to use them for Our own ends."
 
 goddess_master_6:0 "Purging the Valley"
 goddess_master_6_desc:0 "Though alicorns work well in taint, all the ponies we will be bringing to Maripony will not. By bathing Splended Valley in enough magic, We should be able to clear it all out."

 goddess_master_10:0 "Marching East"
 goddess_master_10_desc:0 "East of Splended Valley lies the Everfree Forest. Though dangerous, the real danger lies farther in the ruins of Fillydelphia. In the heart of pre-war Equestria's industrial machine, a warlord named Red Eye has an army of slaves and mercernaries. Dealing with him will not be an easy task, and will require much preparation, but it is one We must undertake."
 
 goddess_master_11:0 "Fortifying the Gorge"

 goddess_master_14:0 "Crushing Featherbrush"
 goddess_master_14_desc:0 "A little west of Gorge Town is a pre-war bunker that is currently home to a group of griffon mercernaries that call themselves the Talons. Griffons, being an inferior being, are unable to join Us in Unity. The only option We can give them is death."
 
 goddess_master_15:0 "Land Supplies"

 goddess_master_17:0 "Sea Supplies"
 goddess_master_17_desc:0 "Though Splended Valley does not have much in the way of good seafront property, using magic to clean up the waterfront will allow Us to shorten Our supply routes dramatically."
 
 goddess_master_18:0 "Purging the Griffons"
 goddess_master_18_desc:0 "Those griffons that persist within Our new land must be dealt with. They can not join Us, and so they must perish."
 
 goddess_master_19:0 "Dunking the Ponies"
 goddess_master_19_desc:0 "Most Talons are griffons, but apparently not all of them. They also had a small amount of ponies within their ranks. Not many, but We can still welcome them to Unity."
 
 goddess_master_20:0 "Talon Weapons"
 goddess_master_20_desc:0 "Alicorns may use magic instead of the projectile weapons favored by other races, but that does not mean other, more specialized weaponry wouldn't be useful. The Talons were using weapons and tactics we hadn't seen before, and We may be able to find a way to integrate them into Our forces."
 
 goddess_master_21:0 "Looting the Bunker"
 goddess_master_21_desc:0 "Featherbrush's Talons had fortified themselves in a pre-war bunker. Pre-war bunkers tend to have neat pre-war stuff. Twilight, being the head of the MAS, knows a lot of tricks that the pre-war government used to hide things. Let's get looting."
 
 goddess_master_22:0 "Talon Tactics"
 goddess_master_22_desc:0 "Griffons fight in a way unlike any pony. Their claws allow them to wield weapons in ways We can not, and their wings allow them the kind of mobility normally restricted to pegasi and alicorns. Now that they are defeated, We can learn from their fighting style and develop some new skills of Our own."
 
 goddess_master_23:0 "Hunting Talon Survivors"
 goddess_master_23_desc:0 "Though the main Talon forces fought to the end, many fighters managed to escape in the chaos of battle. Now they are running around harassing Our fighters and supplies. Using them to develop the muscle memory of Our freshest alicorns will greatly improve Our combat ability, as well as teach Us some valuable lessons."

 goddess_master_27:0 "Across the Plains"
 goddess_master_27_desc:0 "The plains south of Ghastly Gorge are large and spacious. Though their length makes it unpleasant to carry supplies, rebuilding the roads across them will be simplicity itself."
 
 goddess_master_26:0 "Repairing the Bridge"
 goddess_master_26_desc:0 "The bridge across Ghastly Gorge is in ill repair. Raiders have little interest in maintenance and construction, and the ponies of Gorge Town feared a maintained bridge would allow the Plain's Raiders to attack more easily. With both groups under Our control, We have nothing to fear, and can repair the bridges with impunity."
 
 goddess_master_28:0 "Dunking Slaves"
 goddess_master_28_desc:0 "Raiders are infamous for taking slaves, and when We destroyed the Plain's Raiders, there were still some of those poor souls left. From this moment on, their suffering is over thanks to Unity."
 
 goddess_master_29:0 "Utilizing Loot"
 goddess_master_29_desc:0 "When We took down the raiders, We were able to secure their supplies of looted materials. While not things We would make or take on Our own, We can still find uses for them."
 
 goddess_master_30:0 "Into the Desert"
 goddess_master_30_desc:0 "Twilight remembers the old Appeloosa in it's heyday. Apparently after the war, several settlers moved to an area nearby and named themselves after the old city.

 unity_eco_2:0 "Growing Up"
 unity_eco_2_desc:0 "The part of Splended Valley that Maripony was built on is riddled with tunnels. Despite that, it remains very sturdy. Without expanding outward, the easiest course of action for expanding Our production capibilites is to develop vertically with aid of these tunnels."
 
 unity_eco_3:0 "Growing Out"
 unity_eco_3_desc:0 "Maripony itself simply isn't big enough to fulfill Our needs. If We wish to see Our industry expand further, We have no choice but to begin developing the area surrounding Our home."
 
 unity_eco_4:0 "Constructing More Vats"
 unity_eco_4_desc:0 "We are limited in how many alicorns We can create at once by Our low number of vats. The solution to this problem is simple: create more vats. We truly amaze Ourselves with Our genius sometimes."
 
 unity_eco_5:0 "Salvage Lost Sections"
 unity_eco_5_desc:0 "Maripony has been falling apart for centuries, literally so. Many sections of the facility have caved in or fallen down into the valley below. There's still plenty of usable materials in these lost sections, if We can just get to them."
 
 unity_eco_6:0 "Digging for Crystals"
 unity_eco_6_desc:0 "Before the War, Splended Valley was home to many diamond dogs. During the War, it instead became home to a massive crystal mining operation which was key to fueling the Ministry of Arcane Science's efforts.

 unity_eco_7:0 "Clearing the Taint"
 unity_eco_7_desc:0 "We may have cleared Splendid Valley of the worst that it had to offer, but many smaller tainted abominations still lurk through it at night, and the taint permeates the air.

 unity_start.1.t:0 "I.M.P. Pre-Production"
 unity_start.1.d:0 "As the Great War was nearing its close, the Ministry of Arcane Sciences had nearly finished its work on the Impelled Metamorphosis Potion. Though they had just started moving to pony trials, they were preparing for immediate production and deployment as soon as testing had concluded. The last thing they would focus their efforts on before the world ended was..."
 unity_start.1.a:0 "...mass producing the I.M.P."
 unity_start.1.b:0 "...perfecting the I.M.P. to create the best soldiers possible."
 
 unity_start.2.t:0 "The End of the World"
 unity_start.2.d:0 "Maripony was one of Zebrica's high priority targets, something of which the Ministry of Arcane Sciences was well aware. In anticipation of a potential Zebrican strike, the facility was heavily fortified and prepared to withstand even direct hits from megaspells. However, what they could not prevent was the world itself shaking as it was plunged into an abyss of balefire. And as the very ground trembled before the might of Zebrica's wrath, a single test subject fell into the massive vats of I.M.P.\n\n The I.M.P. ripped her body apart, but spared her mind. Her magic grew exponentially, as she quickly became all that the Ministry of Arcane Sciences had hoped and feared: an immortal being, who could wield immense arcane power. Her ego, which she had long ago suppressed, came back in full force. She had truly become Great and Powerful, and she would be the one to save the world! Beginning with those whose efforts had led to her ascending to such heights.\n\n As each pony was dragged in, she became stronger. Their minds were melded in with her own, their bodies turned into the perfect beings. However, some of their minds had such vast potential, such brightness and intelligence, that she had to consider whether or not fully melding their minds to the point of them ceasing to be individuals would be a waste. After much deliberation, she decided to..."
 unity_start.2.a:0 "...bring them all into the Unity, fully."
 unity_start.2.b:0 "...allow some minds to remain partially seperate from the whole."
 
 unity_start.3.t:0 "First Contact"
 unity_start.3.d:0 "As a century went by, the Unity remained locked away in the depths of Maripony. The world outside began to change, ponies emerging from Stables and communities making contact with one another. By the time the Unity emerged, the Equestrian Wasteland was already similar to how it is today. Looking across the remains of a ruined nation, the Unity found plenty of ponies trying to get by in the post-apocalyptic hellscape that Equestria had become. At the sight of the alicorns, some of these ponies bowed down and worshipped them. However, others would shoot at what they saw as abominations on sight, refusing to have anything to do with such creatures.\n\nThis mix of worship and hostility was greatly confusing, and led to some uncertainty regarding how to handle the ponies of the Wasteland moving forward. After some consideration, it was decided to..."
 unity_start.3.a:0 "...encourage worship."
 unity_start.3.b:0 "...try to avoid those crazy wastelanders."
 
 unity_start.4.t:0 "Face Off"
 unity_start.4.d:0 "Despite taking the name of the Unity, the mind that controlled the alicorns was not perfectly united. Although many of the minds that were a part of the Unity got melded into one collective mass, three distinct minds and their associated personalities managed to remain somewhat intact. The first was the creator of the whole: Trixie, the Great and Powerful. Not only was she the first and original mind that had created the Unity, her vast ego kept it together and kept her personality dominant. Second was Twilight Sparkle: Element of Magic, Mare of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences, and the effective third in line to the throne of Equestria itself. Though she was late to entering the Unity due to a malfunctioning safe room, her unmatched raw magical power and vast intellect kept her relatively intact. Despite this, she had a profound sense of guilt and failure over the destruction of the world and her part in it. The third mind was actually two minds, working together. Mosaic and Gesalt were twins, two of the Minstry of Arcane Sciences' best administrators, and capable of advanced telepathy, acting in unity even before becoming one with the Unity. As such, they managed to keep together by working together. Though the junior partner in the triumvirate, it was their magic that allowed the Unity to be the hivemind it was. This was the state of the Unity when things suddenly came to a head. Nopony really knows what triggered the conflict, but the three began fighting within the mind. Trixie sought to use the Unity to take over the wastes, using the way the alicorns were naturally adapted to the Wasteland to their advantage. Twilight sought to rebuild Equestria the way it was, using whatever pre-war organizations that remained to undo the damages. The twins were not grandiose planners, and sought to make the Unity just another nation in the Wasteland, conquering nobody, and protecting anyone they could. In the end, one personality became dominant through..."

###Red Eye Events###

 goddess_redeye.1.t:0 "A Call Goes Out"
 goddess_redeye.1.d:0 "A mental command echoed across the Wasteland: "Come to Maripony". Most who heard it dismissed it as Dash withdrawl, alchool poisoning, or just indigestion. However, there were a few who listened. Some died crossing Splended Valley. Others made it and were inducted into the Unity. Still, others went home to preach the glorious oppurtunity offered by the Unity. But of all the ponies who heard the Goddess's call, only one had the mental fortitude and force of will to try to talk back. Red Eye, the Master of Fillydelphia, would be the one to speak back to us..."
 goddess_redeye.1.a:0 "..."
 
 goddess_redeye.2.t:0 "Whispers of the Mind"
 goddess_redeye.2.d:0 "Echos, thoughts, images. They all flow through Red Eye's mind, in a mess of ideas, with little rhyme or reason. His head pounds, his skull feeling as if it could crack and break open at any moment. He knows little more than pain at this moment.\n\n The mess begins to flow together, it begins to become one. The echos begin to vanish, the thoughts and images become connected, the headache lessens and fades.\n\n Suddenly, clarity.\n\n The mess is gone. The pain is gone. All that remains is a voice. A feminine voice, spoken with authority. Alongside it comes feelings of arrogance, and a sense of being in the presence of a being much greater than himself.\n\n She introduces herself. 'The Goddess'. A strange mix of words and ideas are put directly into Red Eye’s head. Despite the oddity of it, the intention is clear: she seeks an alliance with him, to aid each other in their goals.\n\n He hesitates. A creature like this... can it really be trusted? However, at such a disadvantage, he has little choice but to accept.\n\n The voice expresses satisfaction at his answer, before leaving him to his thoughts."
 goddess_redeye.2.a:0 "What was that?"
 
 goddess_redeye.2001.t:0 "Made of Weaker Stuff"
 goddess_redeye.2001.d:0 "The unicorn slaves Red Eye sent us have turned out to be of highly questionable quality. Their rampant health issues aside, they seem to have been some of the most unruly bunch Red Eye could find. After inviting them into Unity, their minds have resisted melding with Us. So long as they continue to resist Our will, We will be forced to focus some of our efforts on suppressing their dissenting voices."
 goddess_redeye.2001.a:0 "They will submit, in time."
 
 goddess_redeye.2002.t:0 "Victory in West Hope"
 goddess_redeye.2002.d:0 "The foalish ponies of West Hope thought they could resist Us, the Unity! Their misconception has since been corrected and now We have full control of their lands. Now, there is little standing in the way of Our northern expansion."
 goddess_redeye.2002.a:0 "The expected outcome."
 
 goddess_redeye.2003.t:0 "Defeat in West Hope"
 goddess_redeye.2003.d:0 "Those miserable foals in West Hope have managed to put up a greater fight than We had initially anticipated. In light of this, We were forced to issue a tactical reverse-advance. However, they can rest assured that We shall return, stronger than ever!"
 goddess_redeye.2003.a:0 "We'll be prepared next time!"
 
 goddess_redeye.2004.t:0 "The Golden Generation"
 goddess_redeye.2004.d:0 "We suspect that Red Eye's resisting slaves had been a misguided attempt to sabotage Our Unity. If that was the case, it has backfired on him now. Those ponies who once struggled and fought against becoming one with Us have now given in, their minds melding with Our own. With this has come all sorts of memories, from raiding a fortified settlement to fighting off another tribes assault. These memories can be of great use to Us in perfecting the tactics of Our own alicorns, ensuring that their effectiveness in combat is maximized.\n\n However, many of these memories are contradictory in the lessons they teach. We shall have to pick and choose which ones We believe will be the most beneficial."
 goddess_redeye.2004.a:0 "We can certainly learn a lot from the raiders."
 goddess_redeye.2004.b:0 "The tribals were fearsome warriors."
 
 goddess_redeye.2005.t:0 "The I.M.P. Breakthrough"
 goddess_redeye.2005.d:0 "The evidence has been there for a while. The creation of vats, specialist teams being sent into all sorts of wartime facilities, and Red Eye taking an ever increasing interest in Our own operations. However, We never believed that he could possibly manage to create his own version of I.M.P. It turns out, We were wrong.\n\nNow, we are left with a bit of a problem in how to approach the situation. We could let him know that We know, but reassure him that We do not intend on stopping him. This would, if nothing else, make him view Us as a firm ally.\n\nAlternatively, We can keep this knowledge to Ourselves for now, and just monitor him more closely moving into the future. We don't want him trying to create his own alicorns or anything without Us knowing."
 goddess_redeye.2005.a:0 "Keep a closer eye on him."
 goddess_redeye.2005.b:0 "Congratulate him."
 
 
 
 goddess_redeye.3.t:0 "The Grand Invitation"
 goddess_redeye.3.d:0 "Today, the Goddess has given me a message. Though it was framed as a generous offer, in truth, it is nothing but an ultimatum dressed up in pleasantries. Her offer to subsume me and erase the differences that divide us. To become another member of the Unity. Should I accept this, I would be unable to shepherd my New Unity, and many of my Talons will rebel... but if I do not accept, the temperamental Goddess would be unlikely to take it well. Knowing her temperament, she would not be above picking a fight just to prove a point. She may listen to reason if I could convince her of the glory of another Unity, so she won't be alone... but that's a bit of a long shot."
 goddess_redeye.3.a:0 "The New Unity will be for someone else to make. I will join The Goddess."
 goddess_redeye.3.b:0 "The Goddess presumes too much. My plans shall continue."
 goddess_redeye.3.c:0 "Plead for time. Instead of one Unity, we can have two."
 
 goddess_redeye.4.t:0 "A Vision of Unity"
 goddess_redeye.4.d:0 "Councillor Harbinger sat down and enjoyed a nice steaming cup of artificial coffee. This was nice, just sitting here and not worrying about anything. In an hour, he'd be in yet another meeting, arguing about useless nonsense that had no real impact on the day-to-day operations in the Enclave. For now though, he could just relax.\n\n Suddenly, his relaxation was disturbed by a headache. At first, it was little more than a minor annoyance. After around a minute though, it began to grow fiercer and fiercer, creating a pounding sensation within his skull. It only continued to go worse, until Harbinger threw himself to the floor and pressed his hooves against his head. For that moment, his existence was little more than pain. A moment later, a multitude of voices shouted within his skull, cutting through the pain like a knife through a kidney. They all spoke in unison, as if they were one being, but with the voices of a great many beings.\n\n '§RWE§! §GARE§! §rUNITY§!.' A moment's pause, before the pain continued. '§RTHE§! §GFUTURE§! §BOF§! §rPONYKIND§!.'\n\n An image was quickly thrust through Harbinger's mind, one of rolling green plains and grand cities occupied only by ponies with both wings and horns.\n\n '§BYOU§! §RSHALL§! §GHELP§! §rUS§!'\n\n Instructions were quickly forced into his head, the exact words he must say to his peers. Any thoughts he might of had against such an idea were quickly drowned out with a foreign will imposing on his own. He was to do as commanded, he was to serve §rUnity§! as its herald. If he did, a bright future awaited him, one of joining as one in §rUnity.§!\n\n As swiftly as it had come, the pain was gone. §rA new clarity stood in it's place, and Harbinger finally knew his purpose in life. Those rolling green fields would be for him, those grand cities would be where he lived. A beautiful future awaited hi-§!\n\n No, no. This wasn't right. Something was wrong. This wasn't him. These weren't his thoughts. He had to resist, had to..."
 goddess_redeye.4.a:0 "...break free of this curse!"
 goddess_redeye.4.b:0 "§r...serve Unity.§!"

 goddess_redeye.5.d:0 "One of the Goddess's messengers spoke today. Unicorns, with their inherent magical power, make the best alicorns. So the Goddess has made this request: Send more unicorns, and some of the resulting alicorns will work for you."
 goddess_redeye.5.t:0 "The Goddesss demands Unicorns"
 goddess_redeye.5.a:0 "Very well. More Unicorns for Unity"
 goddess_redeye.5.b:0 "We need the unicorns for our own projects"
 
 goddess_redeye.6.t:0 "A Threat from Above"
 goddess_redeye.6.d:0 "A flight of alicorns from Maripony came to us today. Our bullets were nothing against their shields, but they did not attack back. When they landed, one spoke. Two sentences only: "We will be flying through your lands. You will not hinder our travels". They left, leaving us confused and unsure. But their demand was clear: We would have to let them come and go as they pleased"
 goddess_redeye.6.a:0 "The Goddess is too powerful a threat to deal with. Perhaps prudence is advisable"
 goddess_redeye.6.b:0 "We won't let some overgrown turkies boss us around. Shoot on sight"
 
 goddess_redeye.7.t:0 "Red Eye's Personal Bodyguard"
 goddess_redeye.7.d:0 "There are few things more regal than an alicorn in all it's glory. If we were to send a team of alicorns to act as Red Eye's bodyguard, it will boost his prestige and image amongst the wasteland, as well as protect him from any threats that may arise. \n We can take this one step further though. These alicorns could be trained as a proper bodyguard, to protect Red Eye, but they could also have another layer of training. Should conflict break out, they can be trained as assassins, ready to kill Red Eye if the oppurtunity arises. As any conflict would invlolve too much mental power to control everything at once, only one underlying layer can be put in place"
 goddess_redeye.7.a:0 "We can trust Red Eye. Our alicorns will be protectors, not destroyers"
 goddess_redeye.7.b:0 "If the time comes, those who Red Eye keeps closest will turn on him"
 
 goddess_redeye.8.t:0 "The Goddess's Elites"
 goddess_redeye.8.d:0 ""
 goddess_redeye.8.a:0 "As an honor guard they are nice. As a bodyguard? Fat chance."
 goddess_redeye.8.b:0 "The Goddess honors me with this gift."
 
 goddess_redeye.9.t:0 "Soldiers from the Goddess"
 goddess_redeye.9.d:0 ""
 goddess_redeye.9.a:0 "Alicorns on the front lines will let me figure out their strenghts for New Unity."
 goddess_redeye.9.b:0 "Developing good tactics now will help with New Unity later."
 
 goddess_redeye.10.t:0 "Soldiers for Red Eye"
 goddess_redeye.10.d:0 "Red Eye has many enemies. As he has sought to consolidate the various raiders and slavers of the region, many fight back. That's not mentioning various bands of mercernaries, Rangers, and adventurers that roam the wastes. He has many soldiers, but with a few alicorns serving in his army, his forces will be even stronger \n This presents us with an oppurtunity though. With our soldiers in his ranks, should conflict start between us, We can have all those soldiers turn on him, causing mass chaos and much damage. They won't be able to fight as well if they're looking for those oppurtunities, but they will represent a significant increase in Red Eye's combat abilities. One which he will simply not be able to pass up"
 goddess_redeye.10.a:0 "Our armies march together. Our alicorns fight alongside Red Eye"
 goddess_redeye.10.b:0 "Red Eye's forces will have their friends...for now"
 
 goddess_redeye.11.t:0 "Slaves for IMP research"
 goddess_redeye.11.d:0 "As much as it pains Us to admit it, We don't know much about the substance that made Us what We are. For 200 years We've been keeping our efforts on keeping Our numbers up. By asking Red Eye for extra slaves, We can work on perfecting the dosage, manipulating the formula, and making Our alicorns even better \n There is a major flaw in this plan though. Should Red Eye ever try to betray Us, this flow of slaves quickly dries up. While We could use every slave for the IMP, We could also set aside a few to work as a breeding group, giving Us a stockpile in case of betrayal. This of course means We won't be able to experiment as much, so it is only useful if Red Eye does have less than honorable intentions"

While powerful, these "rad engines" do have a major drawback: They run on radiation. While finding radiation is easy enough given Fillydelphia took a direct hit during the war, actually getting it is extremely dangerous. For anyone who isn't an alicorn that is. Red Eye considers alicorns too valuable to use in any industrial capacity, but if We were to volunteer a couple of our alicorns to get into the crater and gather the materials themselves, we should be able to increase their output greatly. \n While this will certainly make our alliance stronger, this also gives Us a chance to sabotage Red Eye's efforts if war breaks out. It would be easy enough to rig the materials We give him with small explosives, set to explode at a moment of Our choosing."

An alicorn, bathed in magical glory, landed in our base today. She spoke to the boss, and the boss relayed her offer. There is another, one who the alicorns serve. And she has offered Us a deal. The one the alicorn called the Goddess has promised us the power of her alicorn forces in return for sending some of our slave stock to Maripony for her use. Doing so would put us in bad graces with Red Eye's slavers in Filidelphia, but with alicorns at our back, we shouldn't have to deal with him ever again"

The threat is obvious, and the alicorn sent to deliver the message already neutralized several of the guards. She could easily carry out her threat. The question is whether we should let her"

 unity_master.2.t:0 "The Assault on Shattered Hoof"
 unity_master.2.d:0 "While We have been moving South, another power has formed and began moving North. This burgenoing group running out of the old Shattered Hoof Correctional Facility has been making moves to become a major power in the wasteland. Unlike the minor factions that We have been eating up, this group has a large number of experienced soldiers, and enough factories to keep them supplied. Fighting them will be Our biggest challenge in the South, and We must do it right. \n\n Every conquest We have made up to this point will help Us in some way or another, but We must have a solid plan of attack for when the war starts. With Our teleportation and cloaking abilities, We can get alicorn strike teams behind enemy lines, but it will take some time to do so. Inversely, We can use Our speed and agility to attack before they have a chance to prepare."
 unity_master.2.a:0 "Hit them fast"

 unity_master.2.c:0 "A balanced approach should work"
 
 unity_master.6.t:0 "Reaching out to the Rangers"
 unity_master.6.d:0 "There is a lesson to learn from the times before our great change. Lesson from the times of war and suffering. As the old generals would say, knowing the enemy is half of the success. While we do not know Red Eye's strategies and tactics very well, we do know those who have such knowledge. The Steel Rangers of Fillydelphia had been in minor scale war against Red Eye for years; We should reach out to them for mutual assistance. Alternatively, We may be able to trick them into fighting Red Eye's people for Us. By watching how they fight, We may be able to better understand Red Eye's tactics, and fight him better Ourselves"
 unity_master.6.a:0 "Let Us hope they will trust Us."
 unity_master.6.b:0 "We don't need them, but We can use them"
 
 unity_master.7.t:0 "Enemy of our enemy"
 unity_master.7.d:0 "Our struggles against Red Eye's forces had forced us to make tough decisions in the past. Now, perhaps it is time to make the hardest of these decisions. An envoy from a considerable foe, the Alicorn mutants, came to our elders today with a proposition of alliance against the slaver. The Unity requests for us to partake in a skirmish with Red Eye's forces, so they can learn their tactics. Working with them would likely mean the end to Fillydelphia's chokehold on the entire region, thanks to our combined forces; however, would it really be worth it to give the Alicorns more ground for operation? Will they turn on us after we are tired of battle? Or will they remain neutral?"
 unity_master.7.a:0 "Let's show them how the Rangers do it"
 unity_master.7.b:0 "t would be irresponsible to accept an offer from those... creatures"
 
 unity_master.8.t:0 "Steel Rangers' rejection"
 unity_master.8.d:0 "Our children have already learned that the Steel Rangers are powerful; it is then with deep regret that they refused our offer to fight the common enemy. Their prejudice dominated over the fate of the Equestrian Wasteland. Indifferent to our reasons, they shut us off before we could convince them to reconsider."
 unity_master.8.a:0 "They will pay for their arrogance"
 unity_master.8.b:0 "We don't need them anyways"
 
 unity_master.9.t:0 "A helpful, steel-clad hoof"
 unity_master.9.d:0 "A promising message came from the Fillydelphian Steel Ranger regiments today. In their wisdom, they agreed to cooperate with us. When We give the call, they will join Us in Our fight"
 unity_master.9.a:0 "Our combined forces shall be unstoppable!"
 
 unity_master.10.t:0 "An Alicorn's best friend?"
 unity_master.10.d:0 "The Hellhounds used to be just some pathetic dogs, caring only about gems. The Great War turned them into creatures of incredible power, able to harm even our sisters in combat. Red Eye has been tampering with their home of Everfree for years now. More and more of their forest is being steadily taken away from them by the large, industrial machines, used to steal resources and enlarge his empire. Our children have already offered their hoof towards their leader. Perhaps these cunning, intelligent hounds will be eager to finally take revenge for their land and join us in our battle against Fillydelphia's slaver"
 unity_master.10.a:0 "Our cooperation shall be mutually beneficial"
 
 unity_master.11.t:0 "Mutants alongside mutants?"
 unity_master.11.d:0 "Ponies with wings and horns came today. Said they wish to kill Redeye. Give us our forest back. But can we trust? Ponies betrayed us many times now. They say they mutants, like us, but they not live in the forest. They change the land to fit what they want, just like Redeye. Pack leader must choose if Hounds can trust them."
 unity_master.11.a:0 "Ponies cannot be trusted!"
 unity_master.11.a:0 "That they're asking shows they're better than the others"
 
 unity_master.12.t:0 "Not a friend after all"
 unity_master.12.d:0 "The Hounds of Everfree proved their intelligence to still be lacking. They refused our proposal of fighting against our common foe; Perhaps years of isolation in the groves of the living forest rendered them insane?"
 unity_master.12.a:0 "Then they will die"
 
 unity_master.13.t:0 "An Alicorn's best friend!"
 unity_master.13.d:0 "As expected, the Hounds of Everfree agreed to join us in our fight against Red Eye. Whether it is motivated by their revenge, or simply by their bloodlust, we do not know; It matters not. We now have a powerful ally at our disposal."
 unity_master.13.a:0 "Splendid"
 
 unity_master.14.t:0 "Overextension"

 unity_master.14.a:0 "Victory will be Ours"
 
 unity_master.16.t:0 "Sharing the Skies"
 unity_master.16.d:0 "In our upcoming strife against Red Eye's forces, We will need as many favours as we can. Our children are strong, but weak in numbers compared to normal ponies. Unleashing their potential should be our highest priority. That is why we considered launching a diplomatic mission to the Pegasus government in the skies, the Enclave. Red Eye is our common enemy; perhaps this may convince them to open up the skies for our children to utilise"
 unity_master.16.a:0 "They will accept...or else"
 
 unity_master.17.t:0 "Together against Red Eye"
 unity_master.17.d:0 "The wastes below are home to many vile creatures. Today, one of them paid us a surprising visit, though her form proved to be more than just a dirty wastelander. A form reminiscent of Princesses of old, an alicorn arrived with a diplomatic envoy. She insisted on speaking only to our highest command. Under heavy escort of our armored troops, we granted her such wish. \n \n In her statement, the alicorn spoke for all her kind and requested access to our skies in order to fight the Fillydelphian menace. The request is outrageous in its nature, and yet... perhaps it will be wise to let these mutants fight our wars for us?"
 unity_master.17.a:0 "The skies belong only to the Pegasi"
 unity_master.17.b:0 "Let them thin their forces."
 unity_master.17.c:0 "They may pass, but we will not join them"

 unity_master.18.d:0 "Our sister came back from the skies with glorious news. The pegasi saw the logic and reason and, in their decision, agreed to join Us against the power that is Red Eye"
 unity_master.18.a:0 "We will call them in once the time is right"
 
 unity_master.19.t:0 "The Enclave Accepts"
 unity_master.19.d:0 "Our sister came back from the skies with glorious news. The pegasi saw the logic and reason and, in their decision, allowed our children to peruse the skies during combat. This will prove vital and provide numerous tactical advantages."
 unity_master.19.a:0 "Until We control the skies, this will do"
 
 unity_master.20.t:0 "The Enclave Declines"

Хотя мир сгорел в пламени ещё до того, как тесты были завершены, проект оказался крайне успешным. На подземной базе Марипони, скрытой в Прекрасной Долине, родилась Богиня. С тех пор её армия аликорнов опустошала пустоши. До сегодняшнего дня. [new_controller.GetAdjective] силам удалось оттеснить её монстров обратно к самому объекту. Богиня обладала огромной магической силой и сдерживала силы нападающих так долго, как только могла, но даже у неё были пределы. Во время сражения большая часть чанов с зельем вынужденной трансформации, которое использовалась для создания аликорнов, была уничтожена. К удивлению многих, как только исход битвы стал ясен, Богиня продолжила сражаться в одиночку, отослав всех своих выживших аликорнов прочь. Возможно она думала, что сможет возродиться в их телах. А может Богиня хотела спасти своих детей. Правды мы теперь уже не узнаем."

 unity_misc.5.d:0 "While cleaning through the rubble, one of our teams found a device. It appears to be some sort of material fabricator. Likely the MAS was going to use it to make IMP once they had the go-ahead, but it has a setting that will turn rubble and useless rocks and rubble into the raw magical materials we can use to make IMP ourselves. The machine was damaged in the rockfall, so We can't mess with the settings too much. What shall We do?"
 unity_misc.5.a:0 "We can use this to make more IMP"
 unity_misc.5.b:0 "Raw materials are more important"
 
 unity_misc.6.t:0 "Canterlot"
 unity_misc.6.d:0 "The Pink Cloud that envelops Canterlot causes Us to lose connection with Our alicorns. After only a few hours, We lose control of them, and they go feral. Some go insane, others gain new purpose. But every time We push into the Cloud, We are rebuffed. As long as the Cloud remains surrounding the city, We will never be able to control it"
 unity_misc.6.a:0 "Until the Cloud is gone"
 
 unity_misc.7.t:0 "MAS-UNI Diplomacy Event"
 unity_misc.7.d:0 "A real honest-to-Twilight alicorn has come to visit us today! She brought with her the word of a entity known as 'Unity', who claims to seek to create a grand new world. This Unity would like us to be a part of that future, to help it create a better world. Do we trust it?"
 unity_misc.7.a:0 "Of course!"

 ###BLACK BOOK Events###
 
 unity_pop_bb.1.t:0 "The Assault on Canterlot"
 unity_pop_bb.1.d:0 "This was not Our first attempt to scour the Canterlot ruins. Many years ago, We had sent other teams through the Pink Cloud. When their link with Unity was severed, We believed them to be dead. However, that was not the case. Instead, they have managed to continue living as their own beings, cut off from Our Unity. They are delirious, borderline insane, and the leader of them all has taken to wearing the bones of Princess Luna herself.\n\n Now, those alicorns We send into those accursed ruins continue to be cut off, and have gotten ideas of resisting Unity into their heads. Though it pains Us so to fight with Our wayward children, we have little choice if We wish to find the Black Book. Our efforts shall continue, no matter how much resistance We face from 'Nightbringer' and Our lost children."
 unity_pop_bb.1.a:0 "We must keep trying to find that book!"
 
 unity_pop.1.t:0 "The Population Problem"
 unity_pop.1.d:0 "If We truly wish for our children to survive in this new world, We have no choice but to solve their reproduction issue. As is, Our alicorns are completely unable to naturally reproduce. Though their lifespans are many times that of a normal pony, they are not fully immortal, and their bodies will some day fail. Unless We can find a solution to this problem, they are a doomed species.\n\n Fortunately, We believe We may have an idea regarding a potential solution. Within Our memories is one of a book, a dark tome full of foul Zebrican witchcraft. The Ministry of Image confiscated it, though We do not know where it had ended up. We must find it, for it may be the key to all of Our problems!"
 unity_pop.1.a:0 "It shall be ours."

 unity_pop_bb.0.t:0 "Our Investigation"
 unity_pop_bb.0.d:0 "Our own knowledge regarding the Black Book is unfortunately limited. We know that it found it's way to Zebratown, and We know that the Ministry of Image had confiscated it. From there though, We don't kow where it ended up. Our two best guesses are the Ministry of Image's Hub on Ministry Row, and their Manehattan Hub. Besides being the two largest hubs of the MoI, they were also popular destinations for Ministry Mare Rarity.\n\n Unfortunately, this is not the first time We have tried to comb through the ruins of Canterlot. An expedition was sent once before, which never returned to Us. We must prepare for the worst and secure the land around Equestria's former capital before We dare move into it.\n\n Our other avenue of investigation, Manehatten, can be investigated with a much higher degree of safety. We have already sent alicorns there in the past, to which they have only reported problems with a select few locals. At this point, We doubt it is actually there, but there's no harm in trying."
 unity_pop_bb.0.a:0 "Let's get to it."

 unity_pop_bb.2.t:0 "We've Found Something"
 unity_pop_bb.2.d:0 "Our expedition has been successful. Within the desolate ruins of Canterlot, Our alicorns have managed to find something of great interest. We don't know what yet, as they have only sent one of their number out of the Cloud to inform Us. Soon though, We shall see Our children once more. And with them, whatever they might of found."
 unity_pop_bb.2.a:0 "We hope it is the book."

 unity_pop_bb.3.t:0 "We Found It"
 unity_pop_bb.3.d:0 "Within the Ministry of Image's Canterlot Hub resided the Black Book. It was surrounded by horrible monstrosities, necromantic abominations, and countless environmental hazards. Most of Our search team perished in their efforts, but those who survived have brought the Black Back out of Canterlot and to Us. Soon, many of Our problems shall become a thing of the past!"
 unity_pop_bb.3.a:0 "After all this time, it's finally Ours."

 unity_pop_bb.4.t:0 "Book Hunters Found Nothing"
 unity_pop_bb.4.d:0 "Our alicorns have unfortunately turned back up empty hooved. We'll have to send another search party in another time."
 unity_pop_bb.4.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 unity_pop_bb.5.t:0 "Canterlot Team Destroyed"
 unity_pop_bb.5.d:0 "The alicorns who were sent into Canterlot were killed. Thanks to the Cloud's interference with Our connection to them, We are unsure of what happened. With automated defense systems, hidden pockets of Canterlot Ghouls, and traitor alicorns, it could have been anything. All We know is that more of Our children are lost."
 unity_pop_bb.5.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 
### Tenpony ###
 ###Tinker Line###
 unity_tenpony.3.t:0 "Celesia Prime"
 unity_tenpony.3.d:0 "At the heart of the MAS hub in Manehatten lies a powerful superweapon. A Megaspell that could harness the power of the sun to call down fire in an extremely precise and accurate way. Right now it sits unused. But that may change at any moment. Thanks to Twilight Sparkle, We know how it works. If We could gain access to the MAS facility, We could use it. Unlike many pre-war buildings though, this one remains occupied. Going by the name Tenpony Tower, these ponies control the megaspell, whether they realize it or not. \n This leaves us with two options. We could try to convince the occupants to accept our control of the weapon. After all, they're the descendants of Twilight's people, and may listen to 'her' pleas. As this is far fetched, the better option would be to try to use a strike team to secure the weapon...or destroy it"
 unity_tenpony.3.a:0 "I'm sure they'll listen to reason"
 unity_tenpony.3.b:0 "Strike team it is"
 unity_tenpony.3.c:0 "Option 3: ignore them until we can destroy them"
 
 unity_tenpony.4.t:0 "Stealing a Megaspell: The team"
 unity_tenpony.4.d:0 "The first thing We need to do when infiltrating Tenpony Tower is to pick the right team. Blue alicorns have a cloaking spell that will allow them to sneak in, but their personal combat ability is somewhat lacking. Purples are good all around, but they're not exactly subtle. Greens are the most powerful of all our alicorns, having access to a massive variety of spells as well as serving as a conduit directly to us, but they have the massive weakness of needing to be static when doing their grandest attacks. A mixed team would have the advantages of all 3 groups, but also all the disadvantages"
 unity_tenpony.4.a:0 "Quiet Blues will be our best bet"
 unity_tenpony.4.b:0 "Send in the Purples"
 unity_tenpony.4.c:0 "Greens are risky, but their power can't be ignored"
 unity_tenpony.4.e:0 "A mixed team can cover the other's flaws"
 
 unity_tenpony.5.t:0 "Stealing a Megaspell: The approach"
 unity_tenpony.5.d:0 "Getting to Tenpony will not be easy. Manehatten is dangerous, with manticores, steel rangers, and worse wandering the ruins. If We aren't careful, our team will be spotted and destroyed before they can even reach the tower. Our forays in the region have shown 3 major paths through the city. If We fly through We can bypass many of the most dangerous foes other than the manticores, but the team could be spotted while approaching. If heading through the streets, we have a higher chance of being ambushed by rangers or raiders. Building hopping will give Us the highest chance of sneaking up on the tower, but it will put the team at greatest risk"
 unity_tenpony.5.a:0 "Take to the skies"
 unity_tenpony.5.b:0 "Marching down main street"
 unity_tenpony.5.c:0 "Through the buildings"
 
 unity_tenpony.6.t:0 "Stealing a Megaspell: The entrance"
 unity_tenpony.6.d:0 "Once We get to Tenpony Tower, We need to figure out how to get inside. If Our strike team is good enough, We can just march through the front gate and take down any defenders. A mixed approach would be attacking from above, using the roof access to gain entry. As a more quiet but more risky option, there is a maintenance access through the basement. There is no telling what we may encounter down there, but it is unlikely to be good. However, if We make it through, the inhabitents won't know what hit them"
 unity_tenpony.6.a:0 "Strike from above"
 unity_tenpony.6.b:0 "Run in horns ablazing"
 unity_tenpony.6.c:0 "Maintenance hatch it is"
 
 unity_tenpony.7.t:0 "Stealing a Megaspell: The final decision"
 unity_tenpony.7.d:0 "The final decision to be made is what happens when the team reaches the megaspell chamber. Should we successfully reach the heart of Tenpony Tower, We have three options. If Our team was quiet enough, We could hide away and ambush anyone who tries to use Celestia Prime, using it when no one is looking. Should the team power through the tower's defenses, We can simply occupy the megaspell chamber, using it ourselves as much as we desire. Should Our team be magically powerful enough, We can temporarily disable the megaspell until We can properly occupy the tower. Or if all else fails, We can just destroy the megaspell entirely. Though all options are possible, We can only focus Our efforts on one."
 unity_tenpony.7.a:0 "Disable it until Our triumphant return"
 unity_tenpony.7.b:0 "We will wait and use it as subtly as possible"
 unity_tenpony.7.c:0 "Dig in and defend the chamber"
 unity_tenpony.7.e:0 "Destroy Celestia Prime"
 
 unity_tenpony.8.t:0 "Stealing a Megaspell"
 unity_tenpony.8.d:0 "The plan is set. Now all we can do is wait. Should our team get spotted, the whole world will soon know with DJ-Pon3's report. If the team successfully sneaks in, We will know through telepathy, but no one else should. \n And if they fail to reach the tower, then We won't hear anything at all"
 unity_tenpony.8.a:0 "Now We wait"
 
 unity_tenpony.9.t:0 "Stealing a Megaspell"
 unity_tenpony.9.d:0 "Our team has reported they are secreted within the ritual chamber. To the best of their knoweldge, the ponies of Tenpony Tower have no idea they are there. We won't be able to use Celestia Prime as much as We would like if We wish to keep it that way, but the megaspell is under our control"
 unity_tenpony.9.a:0 "The power of the sun is Ours"
 
 unity_tenpony.10.t:0 "A grotesque proposition"
 unity_tenpony.10.d:0 "Today, for the first time in years, an alicorn arrived at Tenpony Tower without harmful intentions. And while our weapons were fixed on her at all times, the green creature seemed unfazed as she spoke about the Unity's goal to get rid of Red Eye's menace. She instilled confusion, until it became clear why she arrived here in the first place: The Goddess wanted to use our most powerful weapon, Celestia Prime, to gain advantage over Fillydelphia. The request is ridiculous, seeing as the Megaspell is our only way of assuring our security. However, it would also rid us of the greatest threats of the wasteland, and we could actually control how many times the alicorns can use the Megaspell... perhaps we could give them a chance after all...?"
 unity_tenpony.10.a:0 "If it's against Red Eye... why not?"
 unity_tenpony.10.b:0 "Absolutely not!"
 
 unity_tenpony.10.t:0 "A grotesque proposition"
 unity_tenpony.10.d:0 "Today, for the first time in years, an alicorn arrived at Tenpony Tower without harmful intentions. And while our weapons were fixed on her at all times, the green creature seemed unfazed as she spoke about the Unity's goal to get rid of Red Eye's menace. She instilled confusion, until it became clear why she arrived here in the first place: The Goddess wanted to use our most powerful weapon, Celestia Prime, to gain advantage over Fillydelphia. The request is ridiculous, seeing as the Megaspell is our only way of assuring our security. However, it would also rid us of the greatest threats of the wasteland, and we could actually control how many times the alicorns can use the Megaspell... perhaps we could give them a chance after all...?"

 unity_tenpony.11.d:0 "We are pleased by Tenpony's decision to trust us with their powerful weapon. Our main argument - using it to end Red Eye's reign - seemed to work well; they gave us control over the Megaspell. At last, we have a major advantage over the grand slaver."
 unity_tenpony.11.a:0 "A powerful weapon is now under Unity's control."
 
 unity_tenpony.12.t:0 "Tenpony refuses"

Они оказались внутри нашей Башни Тенпони, и пробились до верхних этажей башни. Их натиск был остановлен у Административного Корпуса, они успели прорваться через ряд комнат, пока их не остановили наши силы безопасности. Хоть их нападение и отражено, нашей славной башне был нанесён немалый ущерб. Вероятно, потребуется немало крышек для её починки."

Ну, сегодня, они решили подраться с нами, в Башне Тенпони! Их поймали на попытке пробраться через туннель метро, который идёт прямо к нам в подвал! Звуки их драк с ордой диких гулей как раз и привлекла внимание наших сил безопасности, потому мы смогли подготовиться к их прибытию. В итоге, вместо того, чтобы пролететь по всей башне без сопротивления, они попали прямо к нам в засаду! И теперь, куча их тел доказывает, что аликорнов можно не только ранить, но и убить. Так что расслабьтесь! Эти существа реагируют на пули точно так же, как и все мы."

Может, старый добрый DJ Пон3 не так молод, как раньше, но он всё ещё с радостью готов месить крылатых чудищ! Я и ряд прочих славных жителей Тенпони смогли удержать этих зверей, пока не прибыла охрана и не одолела их.

Хотите верьте, хотите - нет, но правильный ответ - аликорн! Целый строй ввалился к нам и начал сеять разруху в нашей славной башне.

Нет, речь не о мышых, блохах, и даже не о необыкновенно крупных тараканах. Эта чума - не что иное, как любимая гроза Эквестрии, аликорны! Они засели в отдельной секции Административного Корпуса.

Целый строй аликорнов решил, что им хочется услышать ещё больше передач от меня, поэтому пробились ко мне через крышу и поздоровались. Я удерживал их до тех пор, пока не пришла охрана.

Несмотря на все усилия наших сил безопасности, они продвинулись довольно далеко по башне перед тем, как их остановили.

Несмотря на лучшие усилия наших сил безопасности, они смогли пронестись через огромное количество комнат, и на своём пути оставили полный хаос.

Несколько аликорнов просто проходили мимо, и решили, что наша Башня - очень хорошее место для жизни. Поэтому, они вошли прямо через нашу переднюю дверь и подали заявку на заселение. К их сожалению, у нас есть однозначное и непоколебимое правило - никаких аликорнов. Таким образом, их вежливая заявка перешла в несколько менее вежливую битву, после чего они пробились через наши силы безопасности. На данный момент, они заселились в Административный Корпус.

 unity_fun.1.t:0 "Digging Too Deep"
 unity_fun.1.d:0 "A great rumbling was heard across all of Splendid Valley, as something terrible was disturbed deep within the depths of the earth. A great roar, more akin to a vocal manifestation of nightmares come true than to any noise a creature should make, sounded out as alicorns took to the skies. They could feel naught but pure fear, overwhelming all other senses and drowning out even their connection to Unity. In that moment, even the Goddess herself felt terror strike deep into her very soul.\n\n From within one of the many tunnels dug to discover more crystals, a great beast slowly emerged. With numerous spindly legs, countless ever-shifting eyes, and a jaw capable of consuming half of Maripony in one bite, this creature was a thing of nightmares. Certain doom fell upon all of Unity, as their mother cried out for her children to flee, flee far away.\n\n However, as the great beast emerged into the light of day, it's flesh began to sizzle and boil. It cried out in a great shriek of pain so loud as to once more drown out all of the minds within Unity. A moment later, it retreated with one final roar, descending back into the depths from whence it had came."
