  RED_birthofamonster:0 "Birth of a Monster"
  RED_birthofamonster_desc:0 "Red Eye was not always the monster of the wasteland. Once, he was but a simple scout for Stable 101, burried deep in the heart of the Everfree... A scout who saw the horrors of the wastes, and who saw his Stable do nothing to help those who were suffering."

  RED_lifeofamonster:0 "Building a New World"
  RED_lifeofamonster_desc:0 "Canterlot was not built in a day, and neither will Red Eye's Equestria. The unruly masses of Red Eye's empire do not yet realize that their sacrifice will better the world of tomorrow, they continue to grow angry and rise up against Red Eye's rule, and they must be dealt with if we are to build a better world."

  RED_futureofamonster:0 "Red Eye's Army"
  RED_futureofamonster_desc:0 "While it is one of the most formidable forces the wasteland has ever seen, Red Eye's army is an interesting sort; Made up of unruly and trigger-happy raiders, slaves resigned to their deaths, the elite Talon Mercs, and a smattering of traditional army regulars, our army faces a signifgant coordination issue."

redeye.1.title:0 "Birth Of A Monster"
redeye.1.desc:0 "Beneath Red Eye's Cathedral lies Stable 101, the former home of Red Eye. Stable 101 was designed to house only earth ponies, and after a century their natural ingenuity has led to advances unknown even before the war. Red Eye, a scout at the time, saw the horrors of the wasteland, and believed that his Stable could help the ponies above. The Overmare of Stable 101, however..."
redeye.1.a:0 "Disagrees."
redeye.1.b:0 "Agrees!"

redeye.2.title:0 "Building a New World"
redeye.2.desc:0 "Life in Red Eye's empire is hard for everyone, but Equestria will not be rebuilt without hardships. Throughout all the hardships, and possibly the cause of them, Red Eye has ruled Fillydelphia with..."
redeye.2.a:0 "An iron hoof."
redeye.2.b:0 "A guiding hoof."
redeye.2.c:0 "A careless hoof."

redeye.3.title:0 "Red Eye's Army"
redeye.3.desc:0 "Red Eye's army has seen a string of victorious conquests in the past, but that was when there was nothing like it to rival it's power. Now cohesive armies fight all across the wasteland, and as the stagnation of the Sunnyshore War continues, it becomes more and more evident that our army is not what it once was. Raiders are let loose to sow chaos, usually at a detriment to our own forces, while slaves cower away from battle, and our once galvinized Talon forces have become disinterested and are not preforming nearly as well as they should. If our army is to advance into the future, we must choose one portion of it to prioritize..."
redeye.3.a:0 "Bring the Raiders to heel."
redeye.3.b:0 "Send Slaves to the front."
redeye.3.c:0 "Empower the Talons."

redeye.4.title:0 "Focus Tree Swapper"
redeye.4.desc:0 "Pick a focus tree!"
redeye.4.a:0 "Stern Focus Tree"
redeye.4.b:0 "Free Focus Tree"
redeye.4.c:0 "Red Eye Focus Tree"

redeye.5.title:0 "Conquest Of Sunnyshore"
redeye.5.desc:0 "We have finished our subjugation of the raiders and rabble that inhabited the Sunnyshore Coast and soon their resources will be put to use in rebuilding Equestria. Unfortunately, an unforeseen side effect of our conquest is that most of the raider gangs of the area are now operating in our territory and are terrorizing the countryside."
redeye.5.a:0 "We should hunt them down."

redeye.6.title:0 "Chaos In The Army"
redeye.6.desc:0 "Army has been disciplined"
redeye.6.a:0 "Good."

redeye.7.title:0 "Downtown Fillydelphia"
redeye.7.desc:0 "We have conquered Downtown Fillydelphia"
redeye.7.a:0 "Gather new slaves."
redeye.7.b:0 "Core Downtown."

redeye.8.title:0 "Whispers Of The Mind"
redeye.8.desc:0 "The Goddess has made us an offer"
redeye.8.a:0 "Accept."

redeye.9.title:0 "Steel Ranger Turncoats"
redeye.9.desc:0 "The guards stationed above the Gate of Fillydelphia were met with a surprise upon beginning their shift this morning. A large group of fully-armored Steel Rangers were demanding an audience with Master Red Eye himself. After well over an hour of hurried communications between various levels of command, their request finally went to Red Eye himself. He readily accepted, on the condition that only their leader meet with him, and that they be fully disarmed before they meet.\n\nSo it was that former Star Paladin Nova Rage, with her power armor and weaponry removed, went to meet Red Eye. Their meeting lasted several hours, but by the end of it, the integration of the Steel Ranger Outcasts into Red Eye’s Armies was finalized."
redeye.9.a:0 "We always welcome any volunteers for the cause."

redeye.10.title:0 "The Failure of Blood Mane"
redeye.10.desc:0 "Red Eye sat there, his head held firmly within his forehooves. Despite Red Eye’s generous donations of soldiers and guns, Blood Mane continues to stall, even after Red Eye’s firm demands to attack. If this is the kind of pony Blood Mane was, then perhaps there is no place for her in Red Eye’s empire. Weakness like this should not be tolerated.\n\nRed Eye made up his mind. New Mareway would still fall. If not at the hooves of Blood Mane, then by the hooves of Red Eye himself. Lifting his head up, Red Eye prepared to send out the necessary orders. New Mareway would be his."
redeye.10.a:0 "Never trust another pony to do your work..."

redeye.11.title:0 "Foaltopia Declines!"
redeye.11.desc:0 "Our demands to annex the small kiddie-paradise that is Foaltopia has been met with a firm “no”. Clearly the stubbornness that is the child has gotten the better of them and even in the face of Slavery they refuse to make things easy. Red Eye is not entirely comfortable with the idea of invading this innocent hideout of mostly orphaned children, but he’s left with no choice."
redeye.11.a:0 "It didn't have to be like this."

redeye.12.title:0 "Foaltopia Accepts!"
redeye.12.desc:0 "The Kiddie-paradise that is Foaltopia has finally come to some sense for once and have agreed to our annexation. They knew that they were too young to take on the legions of slavers and raiders that could’ve decimated them should they decline, and they knew that they could barely hold their own without adults protecting them. In exchange for their annexation they would be spared death but numbers of Foaltopia’s population would be raised into slavery as well as become future slavers. Red Eye knew this wasn’t easy for the children of Foaltopia, but there were worse fates."
redeye.12.a:0 "Welcome Home!"

redeye.13.title:0 "A Curious Offer"
redeye.13.desc:0 "Railright was awoken by rapid knocking at his door in the early hours of the morning. Opening it would reveal a panicking town guard, who nearly yelled at him that someone was here to see him.\n\nThis would start what would be a very busy day for Railright. This ‘someone’ turned out to be a griffon, sent by Red Eye himself to extend an offer to the town of New Appleloosa. The offer was simple: he wanted them to become part of his empire. In exchange, they would be given protection and become economically integrated with the rest of his domain.\n\nFor much of the day, all of the notable ponies in town and then some voiced their thoughts and opinions. The town was heavily divided, with many not trusting a thing Red Eye had promised, while others looked only at the potential benefits of such a relationship. Back and forth arguing persisted for hours, until Railright himself spoke up..."
redeye.13.a:0 "He saved us before..."
redeye.13.b:0 "We'll never bend!"

redeye.14.title:0 "New Appleloosa Folds"
redeye.14.desc:0 "News has come in from New Appleloosa. Their town has reached a majority consensus to join our new Equestria. Preparations are already being made to send soldiers and caravans their way."
redeye.14.a:0 "Welcome, Railright."

redeye.15.title:0 "Old Appleloosa Formalizes Ties"
redeye.15.desc:0 "Word has come in from Old Appleloosa. They have agreed to take our working relationship to the next level by joining us fully."
redeye.15.a:0 "It's been a long time coming."

redeye.16.title:0 "New Appleloosa Stands Firm"
redeye.16.desc:0 "News has come in from New Appleloosa. Their town has reached a majority consensus to refuse our generous offer. Perhaps they didn’t realize that this offer only really had one choice."
redeye.16.a:0 "Oh well, go get em!"

redeye.17.title:0 "Old Appleloosa Stands Alone"
redeye.17.desc:0 "Word has come in from Old Appleloosa. To our surprise, they have actually refused our offer of integration. Perhaps it was simply out of stubborness, but they’ll soon get a reminder as to just who they are dealing with."
redeye.17.a:0 "That was unexpected."

redeye.18.title:0 "An Ultimatum"
redeye.18.desc:0 "We’ve had a very close working relationship with Red Eye for a while now. Surplus slaves are often sold to him, and we’ve bought supplies off of him in the past. So Red Eye’s offer of full integration came to no surprise to any of us.\n\nHowever, despite not being a surprising offer, it is no less a controversial one. Many of the slavers around here aren’t a big fan of Red Eye, with opinions ranging from distaste to outright hatred for the stallion. But it’s undeniable that he has been a good trading partner thus far. It’s also undeniable that his armies could march right on in and take us over with little difficulty. With these things in mind, a decision is made..."
redeye.18.a:0 "Why the hell not?"
redeye.18.b:0 "Hell no!"

redeye.23.title:0 "The Unavoidable Crime"
redeye.23.desc:0 "Every day, ponies worked and died under Red Eye’s rule. The factories ate up ponies near as fast as they did raw material, the smog took more and more lives every day, and the slaves themselves were directly involved in more than a few of the daily casualties.\n\nLooking out across his domain, these thoughts went through Red Eye’s mind. Down below, he could see slaves reporting for what could very well be their last work detail, before their bodies would finally give out and life would leave them. In the distance, he could see the flames and smoke of the vast foundries that supplied his army with steel. Over the sounds of industry, the occasional gunshot could be heard. A punishment for unruliness, or to end the suffering of an injured slave? The end result was still the same, either way: another pony dead. Another body for the pile. Another casualty of Fillydelphia.\n\nSo many deaths, so much suffering, and all of it because of him. Because of what he had done, because of what he had created. This level of suffering was unthinkable before the war!\n\nAnd yet, the wasteland claimed just as much responsibility as he did. Out there, ponies suffered and died just the same as they would within the walls of Fillydelphia. Only the wasteland had been inflicting pain and suffering for over 200 years now, with no end in sight. No end, that is, until he came along. With each life given in Fillydelphia, another is saved down the line. With each factory made operational, another step is made towards rebuilding and recreating that harmonic society from before the war. Red Eye knew that he could not lose sight of that goal, that dream. Equestria would be rebuilt, and ponykind would be saved."
redeye.23.a:0 "Salvation, no matter the cost."

redeye.24.title:0 "War, It Never Changes"
redeye.24.desc:0 "As his speech comes to an end, the assembled soldiers begin to march out. Organized columns of ponies and griffons, armed with guns manufactured here in Fillydelphia, moving to carry out Red Eye’s will. \n\nThe stallion himself looks on, as the tools of his conquest move. To some ponies, the sight would inspire pride and joy. After all, doesn’t everypony dream of such a level of power? To have an army, capable of doing anything they wished? To crush their enemies and enforce their orders? \n\nBut to Red Eye, the sight is a more sober one. Some of these ponies would never return from their next assignment. Those that did, would only do so just to be sent into harm’s way again and again. Within a year, it’s entirely possible that the vast majority of the assembled soldiers will have died in Red Eye’s name.\n\nThey were not the first. Nor would they be the last. Many had died under Red Eye, and many more would die yet. Each death, for the cause.\n\nEach death, one step closer to rebuilding Equestria. Their sacrifices would not be in vain"
redeye.24.a:0 "For a bright future."

redeye.25.title:0 "Into The Angry Forest"
redeye.25.desc:0 "The Everfree Forest; for countless years since the abandonment of the Castle of the Two Sisters the Forest went untouched by ponykind never to be cleared or ventured into, mostly because of the innumerable amount of beasts that dwell within it and the unpredictable magic and weather that had reigned over it for so long, even the Balefire bombs 200 years ago left the Forest mostly intact from its prewar days. Now, as Red Eye looks upon the thousands of half-dead trees that is the Everfree, he knows that he needs more room to house more ponies in his cathedral, and that finally doing away with the bane that is the Everfree is the only solution. Eventually he gathered ponies that would set Fire Spells that would torch the trees of the Everfree and the beasts that roam within it would perish. Within moments the entire Forest was aflame, and it was quite a spectacle that many across the wasteland could see."
redeye.25.a:0 "Leave no beasts alive."

redeye.26.title:0 "A New Dawn in the Everfree"
redeye.26.desc:0 "What was once the Everfree Forest was now a smoldering field of ash filled with bones from the beasts that failed to flee the fires. Now this area was much easier to clear out, and Red Eye has made orders that this newly cleared area to be swept and settled. More and more of the former Everfree was converted to shantytowns for the populace both slaver and slave, and more Industrial workshops were being propped up, and there’s still a lot more room to expand. It was all good for Red Eye, all at the expense of some troublesome Forest."
redeye.26.a:0 "Send in the settlers."

redeye.27.title:0 "A Request From Red Eye"
redeye.27.desc:0 "That petty warlord, Red Eye, has made a request of Us, The Great and Powerful! His inferior ponies are not enough for his ambitions, and he would rather have our superior alicorns aid him! Who is he to make such requests of Us!? Yet, this could be an opportunity to show him and the filthy masses he controls exactly what our alicorns are capable of!"
redeye.27.a:0 "Grant it."
redeye.27.b:0 "Alicorns are for the Goddess!"

redeye.28.title:0 "Alicorns For Red Eye"
redeye.28.desc:0 "Slaves and slavers alike paused and looked up in awe as a wing of alicorns flew overhead. Rumors had persisted for a while that Red Eye had recruited such powerful creatures to his cause, but most had simply written them off as foalishness and hearsay.\n\nThey couldn’t deny their own sight though, and soon all of Fillydelphia would be alite with news of the terrifying creatures now at Red Eye’s disposal."
redeye.28.a:0 "Distribute them into Filly."

redeye.29.title:0 "The Goddess Refuses"
redeye.29.desc:0 "Red Eye was met with unfortunate news today, as a single cloaked alicorn appeared within his chambers just to inform him that his ‘insolent request’ was denied in full. Though it certainly would have been nice to have alicorns under his command, he could make do just fine without them."
redeye.29.a:0 "Oh well..."

redeye.30.title:0 "The Great Revolt"
redeye.30.desc:0 "Just when we thought that the slaves were content they sparked an insurrection. Now Fillydelphia is in flames again  and we have to deal with the slave’s petty cries of “freedom” and “democracy”.Now of course Fillydelphia is Fillydelphia and we already are dealing with the revolt harshly ,but it will certainly cost us blood"
redeye.30.a:0 "Send in the Talons!"

redeye.31.title:0 "The Stable Dweller"
redeye.31.desc:0 "Two reports sit before Red Eye. Both describing the same extraordinary mare, and her equally extraordinary feats. This so-called \"Stable Dweller\" was quickly making a name for herself across all of the Wasteland with her adventures.\n\nThe first report, he had received a while ago. It detailed a \"small band of warriors, led by a stable pony\" who had caused great trouble to Old Appleoosa. And now, they were far less willing to sell slaves to him, due to the recent loss of their own. The second report detailed this very same group having been spotted around Shattered Hoof, and having been involved with slaying a dragon that had apparently been living under the facility. They had also played a role in foiling his plans to seize control of the facility.\n\nDespite causing such trouble for him, he couldn’t help but to find himself impressed. This \"Stable Dweller\" could prove to be very useful, if he could convince her to work alongside him. Perhaps she could even serve as his unicorn candidate...but he was getting ahead of himself. He could deal with her later. For now, there was work to be done."
redeye.31.a:0 "An interesting pony indeed."

redeye.32.title:0 "Too Much of a Monster"
redeye.32.desc:0 "Victory was within Red Eye’s grasp. And yet, the thought did not fill him with joy or elation. Rather, he could only feel sorrow at all that had been given, all that had been sacrificed. So many lives destroyed, so many ponies enslaved, so many atrocities committed. All to reach this point.\n\nLooking to his side, he found Protégé standing next to him. Faithful Protégé! A shining example of the type of pony he needed: one that followed his vision, but still held their optimism for the future!\n\nAnd, appropriate to his name, the exact pony that would lead the effort to rebuild Equestria.\n\n\"Protégé.\" The stallion in question looked towards Red Eye at the mention of his name. \"Before too long, Unity will be accomplished. And from there, a new world will be made. However, I won’t be the one to make it.\"\n\nRed Eye continued: \"No, I never was going to be the one to rebuild the world. How could I be? I am the very image of all that is wrong with it, the very icon of the suffering it inflicts. Our new Equestria will have no place for ponies like me. Protégé...when I ascend, I would like you to pick up the torch. To see Equestria rebuilt, to bring about our new world.\""
redeye.32.a:0 "\"It would be an honor, Master Red Eye.\""

redeye.33.title:0 "The Single Pegasus Project"
redeye.33.desc:0 "Reports have just come in from the Canterlot Expedition: they were successful in breaching the M.A.W. Central Hub. It’s defences have been ‘disabled’ and data has been recovered regarding this ‘Single Pony Project’. \n\nFrom what we can tell, the towers involved in the project seem to have been built to allow a single pony to control the weather across all of Equestria from just a single point. We’re not quite certain where this point is yet, but we believe we could figure it out given just a bit of time."
redeye.33.a:0 "A weather control system, you say?"

redeye.34.title:0 "The 3rd Ingredient"
redeye.34.desc:0 "Red Eye’s plans were close to being realized. However, one key issue still had to be solved: he lacked a pegasus to join him in Unity.\n\nA unicorn would be easy to find. Half of the ponies down here were unicorns, after all! A pegasus, however...that would be much trickier. Pegasi were few and far between down below the cloud layer. These so-called ‘Dashites’ were rare, and spread very far apart. \n\nThen again, there were rumors of a pegasus within the ranks of his own slaves. Though he had not seen this slave with his own eyes, it was still a possibility that he should consider. Alternatively, he could attempt to find an above-cloud pegasus to join him. Though getting his hooves on one may not be the easiest task, it could still certainly be done.\n\nRed Eye ponders the possibilities for a while, before deciding to..."
redeye.34.a:0 "...investigate this ‘pegasus slave’"
redeye.34.b:0 "...prepare to ‘acquire’ an Enclave pegasus."

redeye.35.title:0 "A Rising Phoenix"
redeye.35.desc:0 "Looking at the reports before him, Red Eye couldn’t help but be impressed. Productivity was higher than ever, slave mortality rates this month were lower than expected, and much progress had been made. Another stepping stone on the road towards his dream, a dream of a new Equestria.\n\nA dream that was rapidly becoming a reality. With every factory restored, with every section of the city reclaimed, Equestria grew closer and closer to being rebuilt. Soon, a day would come when the horrors he had brought about would no longer be needed. A day when ponies could live, work, and frolic without fear of suffering or death.\n\nYes, that dream would soon be real. The industry of Fillydelphia would become the first stepping stone of rebuilding the world. Soon, ponykind could once again exist and live in harmony."
redeye.35.a:0 "From the ashes, ponykind rises."

redeye.36.title:0 "Voices"
redeye.36.desc:0 "Echos, thoughts, images. They filled Autumn Leaf’s mind, pounded upon his skull and filled him with pain. Blurred flashes flew through his mind, so many and so fast that it was impossible to focus on any one. The agony only grew, the pain consuming him.\n\nThe nightmare within his mind began to manifest in his perception. Over the all-encompassing pain, he could see, hear, and even feel sensations beyond his comprehension. His world tilted, blurred, and then changed.\n\nHe was now looking at an abomination, a creature beyond his wildest imagination. A horrible abomination, that appeared to be comprised of many ponies, melted and molded into one. A flash filled his vision.\n\nNow he looked out across a vast city. Smokestacks and factories filled his vision, and a great mass of ponies could be seen down below. A gunshot echoed in the distance, just as another flash appeared.\n\nWhere was he? Who was he? He knew not, as a vast darkness surrounded him. His entire being was trapped within a void, within a limbo of which he may disappear entirely.\n\nHe struggled and fought, as memories returned to him. As his sense of self grew, the darkness receded and sensation began to return. The thoughts and images which were not his own melded together, and became voices. Voices, echoing all around, growing louder and louder as he regained himself and broke free of this nightmare."
redeye.36.a:0 "What the buck was that?"

redeye.37.title:0 "Red Alert"
redeye.37.desc:0 "For Windy Skies, the day had started off normally enough: she had woken up, eaten her morning rations, and reported for duty as a S.P.P. Tower Status Technician. It was the job of pegasi like her to monitor various meters, gauges, charts, and terminals to ensure all was well with the S.P.P. Towers.\n\nLittle did she suspect that today would be anything but normal. Midway through the day, alarms began blaring throughout the tower, and several alerts went off. This would be accompanied by a message on her terminal screen, informing her that the Ministry of Awesome Maneframe had been accessed.\n\nLess than an hour later, she found herself sitting in front of multiple military officers, all of ranks far too high for her comfort. Question after question was thrown at her, and response after response was given in return. By the end of their interrogation, the officers were perhaps even more worried than they were at the beginning of it."
redeye.37.a:0 "\"How is that even possible?\""

redeye.38.title:0 "A Meek Little Slave"
redeye.38.desc:0 "The rumors turned out to be true. A real wasteland-born pegasus, living within Fillydelphia! Red Eye could hardly believe that such could of been the case, but the evidence was right before his eyes.\n\nCrouched down before him lay a pegasus - a cowered, bruised, and malnourished pegasus - but a pegasus nonetheless. Little did his little pegasus know, all of his struggles would soon be a thing of the past. He would see to it that young Murky was cleaned up and kept safe from the horrors of Fillydelphia.

The facility is located in a central point, still has a number of fortifications still standing around it, and is easily accessible to griffons.

And around them stood a number of Fillydelphia's most elite slavers, all powerful and feared mares and stallions from across Fillydelphia. Shackle's had presented her his conditions. They were simple: She was to turn over much of Fillydelphia's stockpiled equipment to slaver guards, to help secure the protection of Fillydelphia. In exchange Shackle's would personally ensure every slave in Fillydelphia would be hard at work by tomorrow. Refuse, and their vacation would be extended as long as he deemed necessary. And of course, he wished to broadcast these terms and her acceptance of them across all of Fillydelphia, for the slavers and Talons alike to witness.\n\nShe knew there was little she could do. Though her griffons were certainly capable, they lacked the sheer numbers necessary to force the slaves and slavers back to work.

A rebellion was underway, with The Pit being at the center of it. Slaves from all over Fillydelphia were now rioting, beating down slavers left and right. What was initially believed to be a minor riot had rapidly spiralled out of control, as slaver forces were beaten back again and again. Several checkpoints had already fallen, and the slaves had obtained a number of guns via looting them from the corpses of slavers.\n\nThe situation would only continue to grow more and more out of control if immediate action wasn't taken. However, much to the ire of one particular stallion observing the situation from a temporary field command center, those responsible for taking that action were refusing to do so. The courier that had the unfortunate duty of delivering Stern's message to Shackle's had not lived long enough to carry his reply. A slaver stood rooted in place, ready to take up the couriers duty, and silently praying he did not meet a similar fate.\n\nShackles, despite outward appearances, was hardly stupid. He recognized when he was backed in a corner, and he knew that there was only one real option available to him: to accept Stern's demands, effectively placing large portions of Fillydelphia's industry and, more importantly it's slavers, under her direct command and oversight. To do otherwise was to risk this pathetic slave rebellion spiralling ever more out of control, until such a point where it directly threatened even him.

redeye.74.desc:0 "Word has gone out this morning to all slavers and slaves across Fillydelphia: there has been a change of rules. Under Red Eye, the slavers enjoyed substantial mercy and lenience. They were given breaks, showered with rewards, and even given opportunities to achieve their freedom. These generous privileges would be no more. As of today, each and every slave would be expected to work for the rest of their lives. Their purpose was to serve Fillydelphia, not to pursue some far away hope of freedom.\n\n Of course, some of the more sympathetic slavers were opposed to this change of policy. However, their voices were drowned out by the roaring approval of the more powerful slavers who saw this as how it should be."
redeye.74.a:0 "Wonderful!"

redeye.75.title:0 "Terror Against Talons"
redeye.75.desc:0 "Newbeak propped himself up against a brick wall and thought back on how it all went so wrong. His patrol was supposed to be routine. They would just do a quick sweep through the outskirts of Fillydelphia, check up on the few operations going on out here, and report back. It wouldn't take more than an hour, and they'd be back within Fillydelphia proper in no time.\n\n Their first stop was nothing more than a simple salvaging operation, putting ponies to use to sift through the ruins of Fillydelphia and find anything of potential value. There's rarely any sort of trouble with these operations, especially not this close to the Wall. Yet when they flew down to the makeshift camp being used to manage this effort, they couldn't find a single soul in sight.\n\n Then the shooting began. One round from an anti-machine rifle proved more than enough to splatter the captain's brains across the pavement. From there, it was all chaos.\n\n They tried to recover and fight, but before even one of them could get a shot off, half of their griffs were already dead. Latefeather, a lovely chick that had caught his eye for some time, was the first to call for what was left of their patrol to get the cluck out of there. Of course, she was also the next to go down in a spray of bullets. He made sure to take her last words to heart though, and tried to fly out of there as fast as his wings could carry him. He even made it some distance, before a round came flying out of a nearby ruin and hit his wing.\n\n Here he was now, lying against an old ruin with an injured wing and likely half a dozen broken bones. As black consumed his vision, his last thoughts would be of his warm bed waiting for him back in Fillydelphia, and how much nicer it was than brick and asphalt."
redeye.75.a:0 "Another missing patrol? Where have they all gone!?"

redeye.76.title:0 "Round Up the Masters"
redeye.76.desc:0 "Chainlink had many friends, throughout every rank of the slaver hierarchy. Some followed him as if he were a prophet, with a vision of a greater world. Others were attracted merely by power or by the many benefits that came with being on the good side of 'The Master'. For some time now, Stern's Talons had been making a list of all of his supporters. Finding out who stood where, discovering which seemingly trustworthy slavers were secretly within their rivals camp, and seeing who could be swayed away from his influence. Tonight, that list was put to use.\n\n Nine supervisors found themselves dying in unfortunate accidents. They were quickly replaced by underlings who promised to not only continue their work, but see to it that it was carried out more efficiently than ever before.\n\n Four respected overseers were replaced by loyal griffons. Two of them had been awoken by a rapping of a claw at their door, followed by a bullet. One of them had fallen into a parasprite pit. The last had been brought before his peers and tried guilty of aiding a slave resistance movement. His punishment was to have his tongue cut out and to join those slaves he had aided. The evidence was, of course, flimsy. But any who would oppose the ruling happened to not be present.\n\n Come the next day, Chainlink would find many of his less devout supporters having turned their backs on him,  thanks to the generous benefits of being in Stern's good graces. The walls were closing in, and that bastard had nowhere to run."
redeye.76.a:0 "Shackles’ days are numbered."

redeye.77.title:0 "Strongarm Weak Masters"
redeye.77.desc:0 "Aligning with The Master had quickly become a very dangerous affair. Chainlink once had the power to grant immunity to any who supported him, hiding their illicit activities from the Talon's ever-watchful eyes and covering any of their indiscretions. However, those days were long gone, and his influence had been limited to such a degree that he could barely keep his own activities hidden from us, let alone that of other slavers.\n\n A string of investigations provided us with more than enough evidence to justify the demotion or even execution of several dozen slavers. Drinking on duty and taking bribes were the least of these offences, with many of them being guilty of conspiring against Stern and her Talons. We made sure to make it very clear to them what the usual punishment for such behavior is.\n\n Rather than enact justice though, Stern has instead opted to extend mercy and forgiveness to them. All they must do is clean up their act and cease all association with Shackles. We would continue to keep an eye on them, of course, and those who had been involved in killing our griffons would still find themselves suffering unfortunate accidents, but most of them would be free to carry on their duties as normal.\n\n Most of them found this arrangement to be beyond agreeable, and Chainlink has found himself losing even more friends."
redeye.77.a:0 "It's almost time to deal with the stallion himself."

redeye.78.title:0 "Chainlink's Execution"
redeye.78.desc:0 "The time had come at last. Armed with more than enough evidence of his wrongdoings, and with no one left who would oppose her, Stern ordered that her finest Talons be sent to deal with Shackles. Unfortunately, the stallion had become increasingly paranoid the more he had been boxed in, and had taken to hiding away in his little secret lair within the Fillydelphia metro system.\n\n This removed our natural capability of flight, and led to fear of an ambush once our griffons went down into those depths. A fear that was only partially justified, as the guards still under Shackle's employ were quick to throw down their weapons and surrender to our griffons, rather than die trying to fight against them. Chainlink had barricaded himself within an old supply room within the tunnels, which his disloyal guards were quick to point out the location of.\n\n It seems he had planted numerous traps in the tunnel leading up to his land stand. It took our finest little time to deal with them though, and they quickly found the once proud slaver cowering in his little holdout. However, like any cornered animal, he fought tooth and hoof against us. Equipped in a suit of heavy metal armor and armed with a small armory worth of weaponry, he managed to kill four of our griffons before a well placed shot from an anti-machine rifle finally took him down.\n\n His death would barely even cause a stir, and with him gone, Stern's authority was at last absolute."
redeye.78.a:0 "The \"Master\" is no more."

redeye.79.title:0 "Chainlink's Exile"
redeye.79.desc:0 "Chainlink unfortunately still clung to power like the overgrown rat he was. His many persistent connections made it difficult to get close to him, difficult to find any evidence against him, and would bring untold consequences if she tried to remove him. So, a different solution had to be found. One that would removed him as a threat, without stepping on too many hooves or antagonizing him too much. This solution would come in the form of a promotion.\n\n Felmeadow was not a priority position. It was home to some salvaging operations, some minor manufacturing, and a decent deal of farming. The food it produced was only slightly more than what was necessary to keep them running, and it produced nowhere near enough of anything else to really be considered worth our attention. As a result, it had been largely neglected, and lacked any sort of central management. That was to change now.\n\n By order of Stern herself, Chainlink Shackles was to be recognized for his outstanding achievements in the service of Fillydelphia. He had had a long history of effectively and efficiently overseeing countless positions, keeping numerous slaves in line, and ensuring that our great city was still able to function to it's fullest potential. As his reward for all of these accomplishments, he would be granted a promotion to Chief Overseer of all of Felmeadow. He was expected to turn their operations around, making Felmeadow one of the greatest of all our domains. His promotion was effective immediately, and he would be expected to leave for his new post by tomorrow."
redeye.79.a:0 "A prestigious position, truly."

redeye.80.title:0 "Work With Nova Rage"
redeye.80.desc:0 "The Steel Rangers had been a thorn in the side of Fillydelphia for a long time. So when their defeat finally came, it was a source of great relief for Stern. No longer would she have to deal with their constant ambushes or their attempts to disrupt Fillydelphia salvaging operations.\n\n However, there was another unexpected benefit to having finally dealt with the power armored menace. One of their members, a mare calling herself Nova Rage, had proven open to the idea of actually joining Stern's cause. While all of the grief caused by the Rangers in the past would normally lead her to order this mare's immediate execution, the potential benefits of having well-trained power armored soldiers at her disposal proved to be more than enough to convince her otherwise. Not only this, but Nova Rage herself also seemed to be very agreeable, and was more than willing to embrace many of Stern's ideals.\n\n Their negotiations ended up going very smoothly, and were soon followed by orders to provide Nova Rage with the resources she would need to locate other Steel Ranger remnants and organize them under her cause."
redeye.80.a:0 "Welcome aboard."

redeye.81.title:0 "Stern's Rangers"
redeye.81.desc:0 "Nova Rage's efforts have proven to be worthwhile, as she had managed to gather quite a few former Rangers to her cause. As a reward for her efforts, she and her band were granted limited autonomy and gifted their former land and assets.\n\n From the courtyard of the Stable-Tec Headquarters, Stern and Nova Rage issued a joint-speech to the gathered Rangers and Talons. In it, they expressed a desire to see the Steel Rangers live on as friends to Fillydelphia rather than foes, and promised to further their cooperation with one another. At the end of the speech, Stern declared that from this day onwards, what was left of the Fillydelphia Chapter of the Steel Rangers would now be known as 'Stern's Rangers', and would continue to serve Fillydelphia into the future.\n\n We look forward to great things from the newly declared organization, who we expect to serve us well in the days to come."
redeye.81.a:0 "A toast, to our power-armored friends!"

redeye.82.title:0 "Stern's Knights"
redeye.82.desc:0 "It seems that when Nova Rage promised further cooperation, she meant it. As a sign of her continued loyalty and of good faith, she has sent the absolute best of her soldiers to Fillydelphia to serve directly under our orders. This band of elites has been nicknamed 'Stern's Knights', and have claimed themselves to be willing to die for our city. They're not just all talk either, as one of them has already gotten into a fight with a dozen slavers, after overhearing one badmouthing Stern herself."
redeye.82.a:0 "Such zealotry is admirable."

redeye.83.title:0 "A Meeting With Blood Mane"
redeye.83.desc:0 "n Offer to Blood Mane"
redeye.83.desc:0 "To the south was a warlord known as Blood Mane. Red Eye and her had been on fairly good terms, with him wishing to support her efforts in the south. However, since the passing of Red Eye, our relationship with her has been uncertain.\n\n Today, Stern has cleared that uncertainty up by sending an envoy to her. The offer she has presented is rather simple: Fillydelphia's full backing and support, and a mutual alliance between their armies. With this backing, the Bloody Army was expected to launch a full invasion of New Mareway immediately, eliminating Stern's most immediate southern rival. We expect to hear back from the warlord herself at some point soon."
redeye.83.a:0 "Let's hope she accepts..."

redeye.84.title:0 "Tea in New Mareway"
redeye.84.desc:0 "Blood Mane's most capable raiders and trusted guards were an intimidating sight, to be sure. They were all bulky, towering over most normal ponies and with hooves larger than most skulls. What they wore could hardly be considered to be proper uniforms, instead being a mishmash of scrap plates and spikes, all painted with blood to bring the look together. Stern's guards stood in direct contrast to them, being composed entirely of griffons who were equally as intimidating. Their faces couldn't be seen behind their reinforced riot helmets, each of them carried Fillydelphia's iconic anti-machine rifles, and they all went about their duty with professionalism and silence. The two very different groups stood guard outside Blood Mane's new palace, where Stern and her were currently discussing what could only be the utmost important of business.\n\n 'The fucker doubted me! Told me it was impossible to kill someone with their own femur! Well, you can guess who got to become a live demonstration. I don't know if the little bitch screamed more when I ripped it out or when I began swinging!' Laughter erupted from the warlord as she finished her story, with Stern following suit. The very first thing the two leaders had done was break out the finest liquor that could be found in the overstocked basements of the New Mareway nobility. Since then, they had taken to swapping tales and having a time of merriment. As her laughter came to an end, Blood Mane gave her compatriot a more sober look.\n\n 'Y'know Stern, you're a real cool bird. Red Eye was a real charmer, and a good lookin' stallion at that, but he never would'a agreed to this 'ere meeting. But I gotta ask, what's your game?' The griffon considered the question for a moment, before responding.\n 'Well, first things first, I'm going to put an end to those upstarts in Shattered Hoof. They believe themselves to be great, to be an unstoppable force of good in the world. Well, they'll get what's coming to them soon enough. And I hope I can rely on your support in that.' A nod from the mare, before Stern continued. 'After that, I think I'll be content to just enjoy ruling over my empire. Maybe have more outings like this, enjoy my time a bit more once all of the pressing issues have been dealt with.'\n\n Blood Mane nodded once more, before throwing back half a bottle of several-century old brandy. With that bit of serious discussion out of the way, they could go back to their merriment."
redeye.84.a:0 "The two would carry on late into the night..."

redeye.85.title:0 "The Mad Doctor"
redeye.85.desc:0 "Out of all within the Cathedral, there were few characters more bizarre than the aptly named 'Doc Slaughter'. The trust and resources bestowed to him by Red Eye led many to expect him to be purged quickly following Stern's consolidation of power. However, to the surprise of many, he has instead been granted a supply of slaves to experiment on and all of the resources he would like for his bizarre experiments. With Stern's full support and blessing, he continues his efforts to advance our understanding of cybernetics and develop better augments to enhance the performance of our soldiers."
redeye.85.a:0 "To go beyond our natural limitations!"

redeye.86.title:0 "Red Eye's Protégé"
redeye.86.desc:0 "With Chainlink out of the way, there were few within Fillydelphia who could pose any threat to Stern's rule. Few, but not none. One stallion in particular still held enough sway and influence to very easily become a thorn in Stern's side, though he had thus far remained largely quiet regarding her rule.\n\n Protégé, being Red Eye's personal student, was quietly regarded as his successor by many who still remained loyal to the stallion, even if none would dare voice that in the open. To make matters even worse, many of the slaves still regarded him in a more favourable light than the other overseers, due to his well known sympathies for them. When combined, these two factors gave him more than enough room to make a power grab against Stern, should he so wish.\n\n As such, he would be dealt with. His personal physician may have been fond of him, but he was nowhere near fond enough to give up his own life. A polite chat, an unmarked syringe, and within a week Protégé would be found dead. An investigation would find one of the slavers under him to be responsible for poisoning him. This traitor would be executed the following day."

It seems that a catwalk had collapsed while he was on it, sending him tumbling into a brahmin pin below. While this fall was nowhere near enough to kill such an endurant stallion, the resulting kick from the brahmin he had distrubed ended up embedding a hoof into his skull. It took the slavers several minutes to reach him, and he died well before they could get him to a doctor.\n\n Needless to say, Stern was overjoyed by the news. Shackle's lackey's were quick to retreat into the shadows to try and figure out where to go from here, while many griffons have taken to open celebration of the despised slaver's death."

 RED_gearbox_desc:0 "Optimistic almost to a fault, §YGearbox§! is a bright mare with a penchant for fixing and building machinery who could have lived her entire life as a happy mechanic in the Hinterlands. Of course, the wasteland is rarely that kind, and Gearbox was swept up in Red Eye’s brutal conquest of the Hinterlands. Gearbox’s father was a one of the foremost collaborators during the campaign, betraying his friends and fellow Flatlanders in exchange for a place in Red Eye’s new order, alongside the guarantee that his family would remain free. As such, Gearbox found herself thrust into the highest echelons of Boomtown, a role that she detested greatly. To distract herself, she began to listen to the radio, and was instantly captivated by Red Eye’s charismatic promises to build a better future, one where all ponies worked together in a great unity, and accepted the necessary evils that came alongside it. Taken by the lofty ideals, Gearbox set out to aid the cause in anyway she could, which eventually landed her a place in Red Eye’s Army, leading ponies to a better future.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Genri"
 POLITICS_RED_EYE_DESC:0 "A desire to unite is one desire better than those around. \n\n\"Do you know what word I hate more than any other? Slave.\"\n\nStrong, both of will and of body, with a crimson coat and a jet black mane, §YRed Eye§! is an earth pony stallion hated by those who don't follow his ideals. Scattered across his flanks are scars, evidence of the cutie marks he obliterated, the icons that once laid there long forgotten by all but himself. Red Eye's right eye is where he got his name, cybernetic enhancements from his life in Stable 101, where earth ponies continued the advances of science and technology, for personal gain. This didn't sit well with Red Eye, who slaughtered those who disagreed with his twisted idea of mutual responsibility, and mutual rewards for mutual work, and off he went. The barding of his stable around his neck as a reminder of what happens when anyone puts themselves above all others.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
