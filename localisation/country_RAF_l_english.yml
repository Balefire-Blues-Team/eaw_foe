 crabby_crab.1.t:0 "Making Friends"
 crabby_crab.1.d:0 "It’s a brand new day in the Wasteland! There’s so much to see and so much to do! As the great crabs of Wasteland take stock of their surroundings, they face a momentous decision. What would the crab folks choose? To go it alone, confident in their superiority, or to seek out new friends on the Surface?"
 crabby_crab.1.a:0 "We don't need friends. We are crab!"
 crabby_crab.1.b:0 "Friends! Friends! Friends!"
 
 crabby_crab.2.t:0 "Peace or War"
 crabby_crab.2.d:0 "We are surrounded, whether we want to or not, by neighbours. The great foreign policy position of our time must be resolved by either adopting the banner of friendship and harmony between the crabs and all other creatures, or to face conflict and acquire our rightful land by force. The Wasteland is a dark place, where every creature hold designs on the other, what choice we make, we will have a long and arduous path in front of us. In this difficult time of strife, who can say which choice will be for the best?"
 crabby_crab.2.a:0 "§cPeace!§!"

 crabby_crab.3.t:0 "Lord Crabby's Ascension"
 crabby_crab.3.d:0 "The great Lord Crabby had found himself endowed with the royal right to rule! The Crab Kind shall rule this land and stand tall above all others. The ceremony will be our source of pride, an enduring moment of unity for our glorious nation, and every Crab shall rejoice. Our glorious future awaits, guided by the wise claws of Lord Crabby! Huzzah!"
 crabby_crab.3.a:0 "Long may he reign!"
 
 crabby_crab.4.t:0 "CRABBBBBBBBAY"
 crabby_crab.4.d:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] marched out onto a grand podium, hastily erected with the aid of hundreds of skilled claws. As their eyes glared across the gathered crowd of crustaceans, a feeling of pride flared up within their shell. They had come far and done much, triumphing over a great many trials. Now, they stood at the head of a mighty empire stretching across the south. Clicking their pincers together to signal for attention, [ROOT.GetLeader] began to speak... \n\n 'Click. Click click. Click click click. Click click. Click.' \n\n The gathered crab crowd loudly clicked their pincers together, expressing a great chorus of cheer for the inspiring speech given to them. The truly powerful words shared were enough to stir even the least passionate of minds. With that speech, the great nation of Carcinusa has been officially declared. The future was truly a bright one for all of crabkind."
 crabby_crab.4.a:0 "Hurrah!"
