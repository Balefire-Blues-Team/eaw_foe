STT_phial_project_dix_cat_desc:0 "Thanks to the vigorous and constant work of our top scientists, we have concocted a serum able to make any kind of equine into their own kind of super soldier! Maybe a pegasus wishes to fly at an even higher velocity? Maybe an earth pony wishes for its constitution to be increased? Or maybe a unicorn wishes for even more power in their attacks. Whenever the situation changes, we may switch out the serums every now and then. But, we must proceed with caution, while we know the short-term effects are inaccurate to the serum's true nature, our unfortunate troopers do not realize this. And thus, if we continue the injections, they may start to dissent."
