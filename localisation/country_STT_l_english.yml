STT_phial_project_dix_cat:0 "Project D-IX"
STT_phial_project_dix_cat_desc:0 "Thanks to the vigorous and constant work of our top scientists, we have concocted a serum able to make any kind of equine into their own kind of super soldier! Maybe a pegasus wishes to fly at an even higher velocity? Maybe an earth pony wishes for its constitution to be increased? Or maybe the uptight unicorn desires a completely organized train of thought, so their focus can be as clear as the Stable's artificial lights. Whenever the situation changes, we may switch out the serums every now and then. But, we must proceed with caution, while we know the short-term effects are inaccurate to the serum's true nature, our unfortunate troopers do not realize this. And thus, if we continue the injections, they may start to dissent."

STT_phial_matrix_cat_desc:0 "Due to our natural instinct for war among our own is not the highest, we have resorted to other means to getting our way in this radiation filled, horrid wasteland. Robots. Experimenting with several types of robots have granted us an edge in that field, thus, it is purely reasonable that we use it to our advantage. We may either focus our resources on constructing a powerful, mainly defensive type. Or, we can settle for a type more suited towards in agile support class. Either way, we are far beyond our enemies in terms of robotics research."

STT_mass_division:0 "Divided Stable"
STT_mass_division_desc:0 "Our Stable has, ever since the start of its existence in the beginning of the Great War, been completely divided. Before the war began, two towns found refuge in the Stable, but at a price. They would both be completely separated from each other, and be taught radically different ideals. Now time can only tell what the fate of the Stable is.
