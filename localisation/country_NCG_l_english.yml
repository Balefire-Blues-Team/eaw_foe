 NCG_wartime_pre:0 "Our Wartime Predecessors"
 NCG_wartime_pre_desc:0 "We were once great, before the War, there was Profit, Money, and a booming economy. On that fateful day the megaspells detonated across Equestria, so many countless investment portfolios crashed, and so many of our shareholders died. The economy was in tatters. Now, we have gathered up our wealth and we stand poised to once again become the economic heart of this blasted Wasteland."
 
 NCG_profit_stop:0 "The Day the Profits stopped"
 NCG_profit_stop_desc:0 "That day was a true reckoning. There was few customers in the immediate aftermath of the War, the profit margins were virtually nil. The good ponies of the Neocastle guild can't stand by and not think of the economy, we shall lead a bastion of economic freedom and lead the way for the market to us the way out of this mess. Rebuilding begins with money. This, we ponies and griffons can surely come to an agreement on."

 neocastlegui.3.d:0 "Our Scientists are not quite sure how they managed it, but a random accident while testing a new form of magical-energy reactor has caused it to output power... even while there is no Magical gem inserted.\nFrom the scarce reading we can get from the outside, it seems like the reactor has tapped into some fundamental force of the universe, as, according to the readings, its not that the reactor-chamber is empty, but that it contains negative space. Our current theory is that this negative space was created due to a misapplication of multiple power-gems in a circuit, and that it by all rights should have blown up the entire tower. However, as the universe abhorrs negativity, it seems that energy is spontaneously manifesting within the reactor, in a universal effort to restore equilibrium, only to be syphoned off by our machine, to be used by us.\nThe Scientist responsible for the mistake that created this has been reprimanded for it, and was afterwards promoted to head his own research team.\nThis could very well be a clean energy source for the future, once we understand how to properly re-create it."

 neocastlegui.5.d:0 "In a pioneering move, one of our research-teams has invented a new process by which to produce Composites such as hard-plastic from nothing more than slightly radioactive cellulose.\nTrees with a bit of Radiation are not hard to come by, especailly considering the Everfree directly to our north. The new Invention utilizes the inherent radiation of the wood, by causing a process of cascading mutations within the material that forces the cells to harden their membranes into a kind of bio-plstic, causing them to expend all of their energy and dying off once the process is complete. While it is not nearly as smooth and flawless as regular Plastics, our new version is easily producable given our location, and any flaws it does have can be worked around by our engineers."

Capacitors crackle with energy, as new modulators, plasma-excitors, AI-matrixes and more are being produced by our capable staff using these machines to their fullest. The Trade Council has hailed this as a great success, and one a big step towards restoring Wartime profits to the Guilds. Sadly, we are unable to reblicate many of the machines for now, as we still need the "template" provided by the wartime equipment, though our Scientists are confident that those too can be reverse-engineered in time."

With a new comprehensive guide-book for field commanders already being written, it should be a relatively easy task to train some of our soldiers in this foreign method of Warfare. The Great War has proven time and time again that Zebrican tactics were extremely effective in depleting the enemies morale, while remaining supremely organized themselves. This new method of training our own legions will give us a significant advantage when fighting the untrained peasant hordes of new Mareway, and may even allow us to stand against the professional Talons of RedEye's great army.\n\nThe Armed forces of the Guilds will rule the Battlefield!"

Many of our own slavers seem involved in the treachery, having been generously bribed by the Guilds, with only a few of them returning to our lands with the news. Neocastle has already sent envoys to the Cathedral, calling the move a 'Management-Necessity' and promise to make the loss up to us with preferential treatment in trade.

 neocastle.19.d:0 "WIP Bloodmane is clearly more insane than we assumed: She flat out rejected our pact. This means that we may have to go to war with her, while also fighting Mareway."
 neocastle.19.a:0 "Damn that Mare!"
 
 neocastle.20.t:0 "Moving the Capital?"
 neocastle.20.d:0 "With the Nobles of the Peninsula and New Mareway as a whole becoming an integral part of our Country, the question of our Capital has arisen:\nWhile New Neocastle was our Capital so far, and houses most of our research-capabilities, it might also be too small to govern this new Nation. New Mareway on the other hoof is not only more than twice as large, but also houses the pre-existing administration of Mareway, already well versed in administrating a large and rebellious realm. Moving our Capital would also make a clear statement to all the Nobles of Mareway, that we are the new, legitimate rulers and are willing to work in the pre-existing Framework.\nIn the end, this choice won't break our Nation, but has great symbolic value."
 neocastle.20.a:0 "New Neocastle is Fine"
 neocastle.20.b:0 "We will rule from New Mareway!"
 
 neocastle.21.t:0 "The Neocastle-Mareway Union"
 neocastle.21.d:0 "In a small Ceremony today, J.e.b. Beauteous, representing the Neocastle Guilds, and a distant Cousin standing in for Queen Stargazer, representing the Kingdom of New Mareway signed a treaty officially uniting their Nations.\nWhile many saw this as only a formality, seeing as Mareway had already been conquered, this treaty officially recognizes Mareway as an equal and integral part of the new Nation, and guarrantees that all Nobles are allowed to keep their current status. Additionally, high-ranking Company members were awarded Noble Titles, and all Serfs officially made into Employees.\nWith this momentous step, A new Wasteland Power is born, poised to strike at the soft underbelly of RedEyes Empire, or maybe turn its eyes towards the fertile soils of Azuria?\n But before any of that, now is the time to §rP§OA§RR§GT§BY§!§!§!§!§!!"
 neocastle.21.a:0 "Three Hurraahs!"
 
 neocastle.22.t:0 "Trapping the Power of a Star"
 neocastle.22.d:0 "Hundreds of Ponies were digging up the Radiation-hardened soil at the Site Magos Sunforge had designated for her grand project. Under the watchful eyes of Corporate security and the Magos herself, one half of them were excavating a massive pit, to later be filled with the installation itself, as most of it would need to be located underground. The other half were digging the canal to the Azureway, which would both be used to ferry materials to the construction site, as well as provide the large amounts of water neccessary to cool the Foundry once it came online.\n\nStill, this was only the first step: Materials would need to be imported and the structure itself built. Then there was still the not insignificant matter of constructing the internal workings of the Foundry itself, as well as radiation-shields to prevent the entire region from becoming even more of a wasteland that it already is. And, last but not least, the Foundry would need a massive amount of energy to kickstart the process, more than the Guilds were producing now by an order of magnitude.\nBut we will overcome all these obstacles, and then we'll make history!"
 neocastle.22.a:0 "There is much work to be done!"
 
 neocastle.23.t:0 "Laying the last Brick"
 neocastle.23.d:0 "Today the construction finally finished.\nIn a symbolic gesture, Brick Bobcat, leader of the Builder's Guild, and Magos Sunforge, representing the Mechanicum Guild, together laid the final stone in the construction of the main body of the Star Foundry. While the site looks like a nondescript concrete building, only two stories tall, from the outside, it extends a further six stories underground to what soon will be the heart of the foundry itself. Corridors of smooth concrete and cold steel connect mostly empty rooms, as the installation still needs to be outfitted with the wide variety  of High-tech instruments the Magos requested.\nThe fifth and sixth stories below-ground will house the portal itself, as well as the radiation-shields. Level four serves mainly as a water-inlet to cool the reactor and funnel the steam to turbines above, producing energy. The water also serves as an additional layer of Radiation-shielding. Above that, the actual foundry will be placed, where the extracted materials will be processed and refined."
 neocastle.23.a:0 "It's taking shape."
 
 neocastle.24.t:0 "Opening the Gates to Infinity"
 neocastle.24.d:0 "At last, the day has come.\n\nMagos Sunforge took one last look at the readings, assuring herself that this was perfectly safe, though it still didn't feel like it. With a deep breath she banished those doubts from her mind, and set about ordering her assistants to their positions.\n§O'Initiate Sequence!'§!\nWith that she turned the safety key at her desk, and two of her fellow researcher on the other side of the room turned theirs as well, activating the portal.\nAs everyone stared at the monitor, a faint glimmer appeared in the middle of the portal-chamber, quickly glowing into a shower of sparks. Normally this would have produced a flame, but they had filled the chamber with Neon to prevent Oxygen ingniting spontaneously at the absurd temperatures. Finally, with a bright flash, they could see the portal ripping itself open, flooding the chamber with light. Not a second thereafter the feed stopped, the camera melting in the extreme heat.\n§O'Energy output?'§! a few dreadful seconds of silence followed §r'Nominal, Magos. The process seems to be stable'§!\n At that the Control Room erupted in Cheers, they had done it! They had done what only Celestia did in the past:\n\n§RTame the power of the Sun.§!"
