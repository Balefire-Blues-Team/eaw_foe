 neocastlegui.3.d:0 "Our Scientists are not quite sure how they managed it, but a random accident while testing a new form of magical-energy reactor has caused it to output power... even while there is no Magical gem inserted.\nFrom the scarce reading we can get from the outside, it seems like the reactor has tapped into some fundamental force of the universe, as, according to the readings, its not that the reactor-chamber is empty, but that it contains negative space. Our current theory is that this negative space was created due to a misapplication of multiple power-gems in a circuit, and that it by all rights should have blown up the entire tower. However, as the universe abhorrs negativity, it seems that energy is spontaneously manifesting within the reactor, in a universal effort to restore equilibrium, only to be syphoned off by our machine, to be used by us.\nThe Scientist responsible for the mistake that created this has been reprimanded for it, and was afterwards promoted to head his own research team.\nThis could very well be a clean energy source for the future, once we understand how to properly re-create it."

 neocastlegui.5.d:0 "In a pioneering move, one of our research-teams has invented a new process by which to produce Composites such as hard-plastic from nothing more than slightly radioactive cellulose.\nTrees with a bit of Radiation are not hard to come by, especailly considering the Everfree directly to our north. The new Invention utilizes the inherent radiation of the wood, by causing a process of cascading mutations within the material that forces the cells to harden their membranes into a kind of bio-plstic, causing them to expend all of their energy and dying off once the process is complete. While it is not nearly as smooth and flawless as regular Plastics, our new version is easily producable given our location, and any flaws it does have can be worked around by our engineers."

Capacitors crackle with energy, as new modulators, plasma-excitors, AI-matrixes and more are being produced by our capable staff using these machines to their fullest. The Trade Council has hailed this as a great success, and one a big step towards restoring Wartime profits to the Guilds. Sadly, we are unable to reblicate many of the machines for now, as we still need the "template" provided by the wartime equipment, though our Scientists are confident that those too can be reverse-engineered in time."

With a new comprehensive guide-book for field commanders already being written, it should be a relatively easy task to train some of our soldiers in this foreign method of Warfare. The Great War has proven time and time again that Zebrican tactics were extremely effective in depleting the nemies morale, while remaining supremely organized themselves. This new method of training our own legions will give us a significant advantage when fighting the untrained Peasant hordes of new Mareway, and may even allow us to stand against the Professional Talons of RedEye's.\n\nThe Armed forces of the Guilds will rule the Battlefield!"
