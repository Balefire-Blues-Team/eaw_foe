 NCG_wasteland_economics:0 "Wasteland Economics"
 NCG_wasteland_economics_desc:0 "The Wasteland is a harsh place filled with Stife, Struggle and Death. Luckily, all three of those can be exploited by the smart Businesspony! After all, Ponies are much more likely to buy into our message if the only alternative is a brutal death in the Wastes..."
 
 NCG_toll_roads:0 "New Toll-Roads"
 NCG_toll_roads_desc:0 "Infrastructure is important for an efficient operation, but its also really expensive to build. To remedy some of these costs, our new Roads and Railways will be constructed with Toll-Stations already built in."
 
 NCG_squeeze_profits:0 "Charge for the Privilege of Employment"
 NCG_squeeze_profits_desc:0 "Our Employees should count themselves lucky be allowed to not only live in such a progressive nation as this one, but to also be generously given employment by the Guilds. In fact, a good way to recoup some of our expenses would be to charge said employees for the privilege of being employed by us.\nAfter all, there is no 'I' in 'Money', but there is a 'Con' in 'Economy'."
 
 NCG_appleseed_factory:0 "The Appleseed 'Welfare'-Centre"
 NCG_appleseed_factory_desc:0 "Instead of simply executing or inprisoning our Criminals and Mal-adjusted Employees, we will give them a chance to show their dedication to the Guilds, by working several years of Hard Labour. This way, we can produce cheaper ammenities, while fostering Social Cohesion in our Staff."
 
 NCG_clear_out_slums:0 "Pave over the Slums"
 NCG_clear_out_slums_desc:0 "The Hovels and Hutts outside the Walls of our City are quite the Eyesore, and also in the way of increased Industrialization. To combat this, armed Squads will be sent into the Slums to clear out certain sections of Ponies, after which the Builders Guild moves in to demolish all illegaly constructed Housing, and pave it over with Concrete. They'll find other homes... Probably"
 
 NCG_connect_rapids:0 "Rapids Consumer-Colony"
 NCG_connect_rapids_desc:0 " We can always need more production-centres to produce the various goods that our Employess can buy from us. In the Azure Rapids, we will build an Experimental 'Consumer-Colony' geared towards both producing, as well as consuming large quantities of civilian goods, and therefore increasing our Profits!"
 
 NCG_river_industry:0 "Sea-Trade Monopolies"
 NCG_river_industry_desc:0 "Before the Zebras Started raiding Equestrian convoys, maritime trade with Griffonia and Zebrica made awe-inspiring amounts of Bits. With the Zebras gone, an only a few pirates bothering our transports, the time has come to Revive the Sea-trade.\nWith us on top, of course."
 
 NCG_open_lemondrop_factory:0 "'Aquire' Resources through Venture Capital"
 NCG_open_lemondrop_factory_desc:0 "There are still many ruins unexploited, and many leaders gullible enough to allow us to 'lease' scavenging rights. So, we will convince them to let us scavenge there, and, once we have evacuated all valuables, we will simply vanish from their lands, never to be heard from again."
 
 NCG_underground_factories:0 "Mandatory Urbanization"
 NCG_underground_factories_desc:0 "An urbanized Population is on average 53% more productive than a Dispersed one. In order to fasttrack urbanisation, all non-agricultural and non-extraction-focused Employees shall be re-settled into one of our Production Centres. Not only will this clear out the Countryside for more construction, but will also more effectively concentrade a skilled workforce within our Capital."
 
 NCG_underground_rail:0 "Bring our Industry underground"
 NCG_underground_rail_desc:0 "Re-locating important parts of our industry to underground Caverns and tunnels, will not only open new avenues of constructing hidden factories, but will also make for excellent protection against Airstrikes and industrial Espionage.\nCompany Secrets will remain ours alone."
 
 NCG_offshore_salvage:0 "Work to earn the Right to Die"
 NCG_offshore_salvage_desc:0 "If you boil it down to the essentials, death is only an Employee an permanent absence. Frankly, Death is terribly inefficient and cuts into our profits. Therefore, all workers will receive a mandatory dose of chems once a week to ensure that they remain vigorous and productive for as long as possible. A positive side-effect is that once the worker stops working, and receiving our chems, the Withdrawal will shortly kill them, so that we can charge their Mourners for funeral costs!"
 
 NCG_open_sylhpon_factory:0 "§rProject Sylphon§!"
 NCG_open_sylhpon_factory_desc:0 "We always strive to take every opportunity to hone the technological edge we have over our Competitors. Recently we were approached by a group of Researches from Rock City who had to flee the Region for supposed 'War-Crimes'. We have offered them a new home to continue their research in our employ.\n§rExperimenting on living ponies for fun and Profit!§!"
 
 NCG_capitalist_paradise:0 "A Corporatist Paradise"
 NCG_capitalist_paradise_desc:0 "Our society has reached a level where we are far ahead both culturally, as well as Socially of nearly all other Nations in the Wasteland. With the Guilds taking the lead, Wealth, Prosperity and Consumerism will be restored to all of Equestria in no time at all!"

 neocastlegui.3.t:0 "Energy from the Void"
 neocastlegui.3.d:0 "Our Scientists are not quite sure how they managed it, but a random accident while testing a new form of magical-energy reactor has caused it to output power... even while there is no Magical gem inserted.\nFrom the scarce reading we can get from the outside, it seems like the reactor has tapped into some fundamental force of the universe, as, according to the readings, its not that the reactor-chamber is empty, but that it contains negative space. Our current theory is that this negative space was created due to a misapplication of multiple power-gems in a circuit, and that it by all rights should have blown up the entire tower. However, as the universe abhorrs negativity, it seems that energy is spontaneously manifesting within the reactor, in a universal effort to restore equilibrium, only to be syphoned off by our machine, to be used by us.\nThe Scientist responsible for the mistake that created this has been reprimanded for it, and was afterwards promoted to head his own research team.\nThis could very well be a clean energy source for the future, once we understand how to properly re-create it."

 neocastlegui.5.t:0 "Cellulose-Refraction process"
 neocastlegui.5.d:0 "In a pioneering move, one of our research-teams has invented a new process by which to produce Composites such as hard-plastic from nothing more than slightly radioactive cellulose.\nTrees with a bit of Radiation are not hard to come by, especailly considering the Everfree directly to our north. The new Invention utilizes the inherent radiation of the wood, by causing a process of cascading mutations within the material that forces the cells to harden their membranes into a kind of bio-plstic, causing them to expend all of their energy and dying off once the process is complete. While it is not nearly as smooth and flawless as regular Plastics, our new version is easily producable given our location, and any flaws it does have can be worked around by our engineers."
 neocastlegui.5.a:0 "Wonderful"
 
 neocastlegui.6.t:0 "Ancient Factory Restored"
 neocastlegui.6.d:0 "One of our Research teams in cooperation with engineers from both the Builders Guild and the Mechanicum Guild have managed to repair an Advanced-Componet factory.\nThe Building was little more than a rotting ruin when our people started their work, and now the brick and concrete walls stand again, the machines beat once more like a heart restarted. Capacitors crackle with energy, as new modulators, plasma-excitors, AI-matrixes and more are being produced by our capable staff using these machines to their fullest. The Trade Council has hailed this as a great success, and one a big step towards restoring Wartime profits to the Guilds. Sadly, we are unable to reblicate many of the machines for now, as we still need the "template" provided by the wartime equipment, though our Scientists are confident that those too can be reverse-engineered in time."
 neocastlegui.6.a:0 "Wonderful"
 
 neocastlegui.7.t:0 "Listen on... Forever"

 neocastlegui.7.a:0 "Wonderful"
 
 neocastlegui.8.t:0 "The Neocastle-Legions"
 neocastlegui.8.d:0 "In an impressive feat of historical reverse-engineering, our Scientists focused on Zebra-Research have managed to replicate the exact organisation and training of the famous Zebrican Legions. With a new comprehensive guide-book for field commanders already being written, it should be a relatively easy task to train some of our soldiers in this foreign method of Warfare. The Great War has proven time and time again that Zebrican tactics were extremely effective in depleting the nemies morale, while remaining supremely organized themselves. This new method of training our own legions will give us a significant advantage when fighting the untrained Peasant hordes of new Mareway, and may even allow us to stand against the Professional Talons of RedEye's.\n\nThe Armed forces of the Guilds will rule the Battlefield!"
 neocastlegui.8.a:0 "Wonderful"
 
 neocastlegui.9.t:0 "The Revised Manual for Combat-Magic"
