 cloudsdale.1.t:0 "The Grand Conspiracy"
 cloudsdale.1.d:0 "Unknown to even the diarch, throughout the Great War against the Zebras a plan was being set in motion. A plan conceived by one of Equestria’s core pony tribes: The Pegasi. This plan was conceived solely by Pegasi  Military, Political, and Industrial officials, and only a small handful outside of these types knew it. The plan in question was the Pegasi abandonment of Equestria, known as The Grand Conspiracy.\n The simple premise is that should Equestria lose the war against the Zebras, or if Balefire bombs reigned across the globe, The Pegasi (mainly those of military, political, industrial importance) would take to the skies and hide amongst the clouds as a fallback point, essentially leaving the rest of Equestria for dead. There at least one third of Equestria’s populous would remain unscathed, and from there they would organize and try to forge their own Equestria in the image of the Pegasi. The reason this was so secret is because this plan would essentially mean shattering the image of a united three pony tribes, which would spell serious trouble for the Pegasi governmental individuals if the diarch found out about this Conspiracy. \n This Conspiracy would eventually give birth to an all Pegasi government above the clouds that would remain in hiding for who knows how long, and the name of that government is:\nThe Enclave \n In the planning phases of that conspiracy there was division on who should lead this Pegasi government, the Political and Industrial officials who know how to keep political stability and economic prosperity, or the Military Officers who know how to keep strength and peace from within and without. In time, one of these factions came on top on who should lead the Pegasi, and that faction was... "

 cloudsdale.2.d:0 "We knew the end was coming, we knew that despite the best efforts of the diarch it would all come crumbling down. We knew that whoever wins, we lose. The first great sign was Celestia’s abdication, the next was when the Zebras lost their minds when Luna ascended to the throne, now, it was for causes unknown even to us that ignited the Balefire bombs all over the globe so long ago. In the panic that followed countless souls were lost, countless more found shelter in the Stables or other forms of shelter from the bombs, for us however, we took to the skies. It was our plan all along to take to the skies to hide from the Tartarus below, and we assumed that the Griffons or even the Dragons wouldn’t follow us because they don’t know the skies like we do, so we’re safe. One thing we lacked planning on was who or what would we save if Balefire reigned, some urged that we gather as many Pegasi as we can to save more lives and have more personal to crew our Raptors and such, while others had argued that we gather as much military equipment and technology as we can so that we would have an uncontested military advantage once the dust settled. In the heat of the moment that was that fateful say managed to save... "

 cloudsdale.3.d:0 "Much to the horror and dismay of the surviving Pegasi; the Pegasus Capital of the world, Cloudsdale, was one of the first cities vaporized by Zebra Balefire bombs on that fateful day. The survivors were eager to start anew, a New Cloudsdale that would be the prime jewel of The Enclave, a city that Pegasi from across the clouds of Equestria could look up to for hope, and so within the first years after the bombs fell a New Cloudsdale was built. Southward of what little is left of Cloudsdale was the site of the city of New Cloudsdale; a grand city that was as large as the old Cloudsdale and eventually grew to become the seat of government of the overall Enclave, as well as the seat of the Cloudsdale Enclave, one of several splinter factions within the Enclave that evolved over time. The city of New Cloudsdale was a monument and the pinnacle of the efforts of countless Pegasi that had dedicated themselves to rebuilding Equestria in the Enclave’s image. In the first years of New Cloudsdale’s construction it was debated on what the city itself should focus on being, an advanced military industrial complex dedicated to manufacturing the Enclave’s weapons, or a sprawling civilian metropolis with civilian industries and housing much similar to the old Cloudsdale. Eventually the bulk of New Cloudsdale was comprised of..."
