 NEV_con_death_leslie_desc:0 "These ponies have been plundering, raping, and killing for most of their lives. They deserve no better than for us to free their heads from their wretched bodies"

 NEV_con_loot_leslie:0 "Seize Their Loot"
 NEV_con_loot_leslie_desc:0 "Despite being a pitiful band of savages, they nonetheless managed to ammass quite a treasure trove of loot. And now, their spoils have become our spoils."

 NEV_con_labour_leslie:0 "Forced Labour For Raiders"
 NEV_con_labour_leslie_desc:0 "These ponies are little more than scum. However, they are still ponies, and they could still be useful to our nation. For their crimes, they shall be sentenced to manual labour for the rest of their days."

 NEV_con_olympia2_leslie:0 "Industrialize Olympia"
 NEV_con_olympia2_leslie_desc:0 "Olympia has rapidly grown into a proper pegasus city. However, it still relies heavily on imports from above the clouds. It's about time we work to ensure that it is self-sufficient, with an industry to call its own."
 
 NEV_con_march_mango:0 "Into The Mango Jungles"
 NEV_con_march_mango_desc:0 "The northernmost part of the South-Equestrian jungles hosts a curious population of batponies, seemingly obsessed with fruit. Unfortunately for them, their land also just so happens to be a prime target for our expansion."
 
 NEV_con_poison_mango:0 "Poison Their Mangoes"
 NEV_con_poison_mango_desc:0 "Well, since they are so obsessed with their beloved fruit, why not systematically poison them and thin out their population to make room for our own proper pegasus settlers?"
 
 NEV_con_burn_mango:0 "Slash And Burn"
 NEV_con_burn_mango_desc:0 "The bats ranks have been culled enough to render them a non-threat. Now, we can start to agressively clear the jungle and settle pegasi on the resultant fertile soil. Those few bats left will inevitably perish in the flames."
 
 NEV_con_brother_mango:0 "Our Brothers In The Sky"
 NEV_con_brother_mango_desc:0 "Pegasi and batponies are quite similar biologically. We're both ponies, we both have wings, and we both have generally sleek builds. It wouldn't be much of a leap to think of them as our long lost moon-touched brothers."
 
 NEV_con_honor_mango:0 "Honorary Pegasi"
 NEV_con_honor_mango_desc:0 "These batponies have proven themselves to be far more agreeable than we ever hoped. They have integrated well into our society and are getting along very well with our pegasi civilians.

 NEV_con_orchard_mango:0 "The Jungle Orchards"

 NEV_con_sort_sha:0 "Sort Out The Ponies, Kill The Griffons"
 NEV_con_sort_sha_desc:0 "The ponies can be dealt with. The griffons on the other hoof shall receive no mercy. Too often have the griffons tried to take the skies from us. Today, we take the surface from them! Every soldier to have been killed by one of those clawed bastards shall be avenged today!"
 
 NEV_con_coop_sha:0 "Amnesty For Cooperation"

 NEV_con_talon_sha_desc:0 "We might of had our differences in the past. After all, pegasi and griffons have been bitter enemies for as long as anypony can remember. However, there can be a place for both of us in this new world. So long as we are in charge, of course."
 
 NEV_con_border_sha:0 "Gradual Settlement"
 NEV_con_border_sha_desc:0 "To begin the process of integrating the Shattered Hoof region, we shall create new settlements in the relatively barren land between our already settled land and Shattered Hoof itself. This will ease us into settling the rest of the region."
 
 NEV_con_join_sha:0 "Join The Hoof And The Junction"
 NEV_con_join_sha_desc:0 "Shattered Hoof and Junction Town are now some of the largest settlements under our control. If we were to bring the two together, we could create one massive awe-inspiring city. This city shall be named Pegasopolis, after the ancient city of our ancestors."

 NEV_con_water_sha:0 "Provide Clean Water"
 NEV_con_water_sha_deac:0 "Our advanced technology makes it an easy task to set up purifiers along the coast. The newly cleansed water can then be supplied not just to our own pegasi, but also to the Wastelanders. This will hopefuly go a long way towards integrating them."
 
 NEV_con_integrate_sha:0 "Intergrated Communities"
 NEV_con_integrate_sha_desc:0 "Our gifts of pure water were well received and served to open the way for proper diplomacy. The many small settlements dotted along the Azureway are more than willing to join our nation, so long as the water keeps flowing."

 NEV_con_topple_mrw_desc:0 "Their city might look grand, but it is only a husk of its former glory. Anypony that still believes that monarchy is a good form of government clearly doesn't know history very well."
 
 NEV_con_noble_mrw:0 "Put The False Nobles To The Sword"
 NEV_con_noble_mrw_desc:0 "The very concept of a 'nobility' ruling over ponies is outdated and morally wrong. We'll remind these so-called 'nobles' that they can bleed and die just like anypony else."

 NEV_con_integrate_mrw:0 "Integrate Mareway's Bureaucracy"
 NEV_con_integrate_mrw_desc:0 "We can integrate the extensive bueraucracy of Mareway into our own to ease the transition of power. This will unfortunately have the downside of allowing Mareway's nobility to cling onto power."

 NEV_con_cement_mrw:0 "Mareway Cement Factory"
 NEV_con_cement_mrw_desc:0 "We will need metric tons of cement if we ever wish to fully rebuild the skyscrapers and housing-block of old.

With a little bit of effort, these factories could be made operational once again."
 
 NEV_con_trans_railway:0 "Clear The Rubble"
 NEV_con_trans_railway_desc:0 "We are now in control of large swaths of land. Unfortunately, much of this land is still occupied by ancient ruins that hinder both transportation and expansion.

 NEV_con_buy_guild:0 "Offer To Buyout The Guilds"
 NEV_con_buy_guild_desc:0 "The Neocastle Guilds are a business first, nation second. The ponies at the top are driven almost entirely by greed, and are said to be willing to sell even their own mothers for the right amount of caps. Perhaps they would even be willing to sell their nation to us."
 
 NEV_con_war_guild:0 "If It's War They Want..."
 NEV_con_war_guild_desc:0 "The Guilds have proven themselves to care about more than just caps and have rejected our offer. Though this is commendable, we're afraid that this could only ever of ended one way."

 NEV_con_servant_guild:0 "Free The Indentured Servants"

 NEV_con_burn_red_desc:0 "These slavers are truly despicable ponies. We should wipe them all out and free the wasteland of their yoke once and for all! Their factories shall be bombed, their homes shall be scorched, and all of Fillydelphia shall tremble against the Enclave's might."
 
 NEV_con_manage_red:0 "Under New Management"
 NEV_con_manage_red_desc:0 "Hello, ponies of Fillydelphia. We are happy to inform you that the savage tyrant Red Eye is no more! The Enclave has freed you of his rule.

 NEV_con_check_red:0 "Keep The Slaves In Check"
 NEV_con_check_red_desc:0 "There are tens of thousands of slaves in Fillydelphia, many of them clamouring for freedom. With a few token concessions and military oversight we can keep them in check."

 NEV_con_veteran_red:0 "Grant Farms To Veterans"
 NEV_con_veteran_red_desc:0 "In exchange for their valiant service against Red Eye's vast armies, those soldiers who have reached retirement age shall be gifted land in the more rural areas of Red Eye's former domain.

 NEV_con_locals_red:0 "Extend A Hoof To The Locals"
 NEV_con_locals_red_desc:0 "Many here see us as foreign conquerers, even though it was us that freed them from bondage. We should launch a series of campaigns to remind them that we are only here to help them."

 NEV_con_fertile_red_desc:0 "Red Eye's lands are vast and contain many fertile tracts of soil. We'll sell this land off to pegasi settlers for next to nothing, so as to ensure that as much of it as possible gets bought up."

 NEV_vis_tornado_council:0 "Put Tornado In Charge Of The Council"
 NEV_vis_tornado_council_desc:0 "Tornado has proven a reliable and cooperative pony, as well as a good loser. We can use his experience and level-headedness by putting him in charge of the remnants of the Council."
 
 NEV_vis_seperate_but_equal:0 "Separate, But Equal, Institutions"
 NEV_vis_seperate_but_equal_desc:0 "While the Council did indeed try to undermine our democracy, the blame lies at the hooves of the ponies in charge rather than the institution itself. Now that their leadership is far more respectable, we can show them trust and restore at least some of their power."
 
 NEV_vis_oversight_council:0 "Put The Council Under Permanent Oversight"
 NEV_vis_oversight_council_desc:0 "The Council has proven to be nothing but harmful towards our democratic system. If we wish to ensure that they can never threaten the liberty and freedom of our ponies again, we must place the Council under the full oversight of the Senate."
 
 NEV_vis_merge_institutions:0 "Merge Council And Senate Authority"
 NEV_vis_merge_institutions_desc:0 "In order to ensure the safety of our democracy, the Council shall cease to be a seperate entity within the government. Instead, they shall be replaced entirely by a Military Committee, that shall be a part of the Senate and comprised entirely of Senators."
 
 NEV_vis_consolidate_power:0 "Consolidate Power In The Senate"
 NEV_vis_consolidate_power_desc:0 "With the Council dealt with, we can now turn our attention to the rest of the Senate. We may hold the majority within it, but we must work to ensure that we can keep that majority long enough to push our reforms through."
 
 NEV_vis_lesser_senate:0 "Reinstate The Lesser Senate"
 NEV_vis_lesser_senate_desc:0 "The Lesser Senate once served as our governments judicial branch, prior to that role being overtaken by the Council. Now, it is time for them to once again assume that role!"

 NEV_vis_reform_press2:0 "Get Rid Of State Propaganda"
 NEV_vis_reform_press2_desc:0 "For the longest time, all media within the Enclave has been monitored by the state. This practice was a leftover from the earliest days of our existence, when it was necessary to stabilize our precarious position. Those days are not today, and it is time to take our hooves off of the media entirely."
 
 NEV_vis_reform_press3:0 "Declassify Info About The Wasteland"
 NEV_vis_reform_press3_desc:0 "The average Enclave citizen knows almost nothing about the surface, save for what the Council told them. The Council's narrative was unforunately comprised almost entirely of lies, and we expect considerable backlash for that revelation."
 
 NEV_vis_reform_press4:0 "Adapt To The Times"
 NEV_vis_reform_press4_desc:0 "Insulting or even sharply criticising the government used to be enough to have you thrown into prison on charges of sedition. Now, that's no longer the case. Unfortunately, many within our government don't seem to grasp this change. We must adapt if we wish to keep the newly freed press from becoming our downfall."
 
 NEV_vis_reform_industry1:0 "Reform The Industrial Sector"
 NEV_vis_reform_industry1_desc:0 "New Cloudsdale is a true titan of industry, but almost all of it is needed for the day-to-day operations above the clouds. By reforming the restrictions placed upon private business, we can breathe new life into our economy."
 
 NEV_vis_reform_industry2:0 "Privatize Military Assets"
 NEV_vis_reform_industry2_desc:0 "Over the years our military-industrial complex has become quite bloated under the Council's oversight. Now that we are on the path of peace rather than war, we can afford to sell off some of these factories!"

 NEV_vis_reform_industry3_desc:0 "While private investments between different Enclave cities have always been legal, there were still a lot of restrictions placed upon anyone that acquired power within industries vital to the state.

 NEV_vis_reform_industry4_desc:0 "The New Cloudsdale Economic Planning Commitee, or NEEPC, has for the longest time been tasked with making sure our economy stays within the bounds of our limited resources.

 NEV_vis_reform_culture3:0 "Pardon Dashites"
 NEV_vis_reform_culture3_desc:0 "The mark of "Dashite" has always been used by the Council in order to supress dissent and exile those that didn't agree with them. Today, these wayward pegasi shall be allowed to return home!"
 
 NEV_vis_reform_culture4:0 "United In Spirit, Not Race"
 NEV_vis_reform_culture4_desc:0 "Too long have we seen ourselves as racially superior, when it is in fact our society that has a leg up on the Wastelanders. Instead of looking down on them, we should see it as our duty to elevate them to our level."
 
 NEV_vis_reform_military1:0 "Reform The Military"
 NEV_vis_reform_military1_desc:0 "Our military has become too politically powerful. It is a bloated apparatus sucking out all our funds and leaving a scarce budget for the civilian sector. It is time that we work to strip away their political sway and reallocate funds towards more worthy pursuits."
 
 NEV_vis_reform_military2:0 "Crack Down On The Warmongers"
 NEV_vis_reform_military2_desc:0 "We need to aspire to be a peaceful society, and some of the military staff is just too jingoistic. Of course we won't let go of such skilled personnel. They will instead be transfered to the Wargames Division."
 
 NEV_vis_reform_military3:0 "Focus On Soldier Health"

 NEV_vis_reform_military4:0 "Debunk The Glory Of War"

 NEV_vis_reform_academia3:0 "Legalize Student Leagues"
 NEV_vis_reform_academia3_desc:0 "Our universities have been the greatest breeding ground for anti-Council sentiment. The Council tried to keep them down, but now that they have been put in their place, the students may freely express their sentiments."
 
 NEV_vis_reform_academia4:0 "The "Bright Minds" Program"
 NEV_vis_reform_academia4_desc:0 "The time has come to unleash the intellect of our best and brightest so that they may find solutions to the innumerable problems plaguing the Wasteland!"

 NEV_vis_surface_aid_program_desc:0 "Now that we have swayed the populus towards our ideals and have a resurgent economy, we can finally do what we should have done decades ago: descend to the Surface. Only not as conquerers, but rather as saviours."

 NEV_vis_swamp_water:0 "Provide Clean Water"
 NEV_vis_swamp_water_desc:0 "It's frankly a miracle that a bunch of ponies drinking that vile swamp water haven't all died of some terrible disease yet. Our Surface teams will help them build purifiers and dig wells, so they can drink clean water for probably the first time in their lives."
 
 NEV_vis_swamp_roads:0 "Help Them Build Roads"
 NEV_vis_swamp_roads_desc:0 "The most obvious reason why the ponies of Hayseed Swamp haven't build cities like some other parts of the Wasteland is the atrocious infrastructure of the region. Even some basic stone and dirt roads would help immensly, along with draining some of the swamp itself."
 
 NEV_vis_swamp_industry:0 "Send Industrial Aid"
 NEV_vis_swamp_industry_desc:0 "The swampponies have a severely underdeveloped industry, even when compared to other Wasteland nations. With the might of the New Cloudsdale economy behind us, we can jumpstart their industrial capacity!"
 
 NEV_vis_swamp_sunshine:0 "Our Place Under The Sun"
 NEV_vis_swamp_sunshine_desc:0 "Our 'trial run' has been an astounding success. The ponies of Hayseed Swamp have proven to be amazingly grateful for our aid, and are even willing to join our great nation. This shall be the first stepping stone towards helping all of the Surface ponies."
 
 NEV_vis_allow_citizenship:0 "Allow Non-Pegasus Citizenship"
 NEV_vis_allow_citizenship_desc:0 "Our citizneship laws curently prohibit citizenship from being held by any non-pegasus pony. These laws do little but enforce inequality, and it is time that we do away with them. Citizenship shall be available for all!"
 
 NEV_vis_allow_griffons:0 "Allow Griffon Citizenship"
 NEV_vis_allow_griffons_desc:0 "The griffons have been the Enclave's long-time rivals and enemies. Yet, they are the only other race to share the Equestrian skies with us. We must extend a hoof to them in friendship."
 
 NEV_vis_allow_zebras:0 "Allow Zebra Citizenship"
 NEV_vis_allow_zebras_desc:0 "Zebras haven't really been a target of government propaganda since the War itself. Despite this, many still hold negative opinions towards the ones who destroyed Cloudsdale and the land below. Allowing them to become citizens will be a controversial move, but it is one that must be done if we wish to move beyond the past."
 
 NEV_vis_allow_mud_ponies:0 "Allow Earthpony And Unicorn Citizenship"
 NEV_vis_allow_mud_ponies_desc:0 "The grounded pony races aren't all that different from us. It is time that we mend the divide between the Three Tribes and extend citizenship to all ponies."

 NEV_vis_science_of_war_desc:0 "A young researcher from the University of New Cloudsdale has come to the Senate with an interesting proposal: he believes that war and combat should be studied as a science. According to him, this would allow us to find the most efficient and effective methods of waging war."
 
 NEV_vis_assess_research:0 "Re-Evaluate Our Current Weapons Research"
 NEV_vis_assess_research_desc:0 "We have been relying on the same old weapons for a long time. In fact, some of the energy weapons still being used today were originally used in the War!

 NEV_vis_heavy_weapons:0 "Improve Our Heavy Weapons"

 NEV_vis_sunshine_trade:0 "The Sunshine Trade"
 NEV_vis_sunshine_trade_desc:0 "Senator Seafire has come up with a radical new economic plan, based around access to sunlight.

 NEV_vis_sunshine_mango2:0 "Biofuel Refineries In The Jungle"
 NEV_vis_sunshine_mango2_desc:0 "Though they won't let us touch their mangos, the batponies are more than willing to let us utilize anything else the jungle has to offer.

 NEV_vis_sunshine_ncr1_desc:0 "The lands to the west are perhaps some of the most civilized that we've seen so far. A sizable amount of territory is under a central authority with a sizable military force to back it up. Perhaps they would be open to peaceful relations?"
 
 NEV_vis_sunshine_ncr2:0 "Establish Free Movement"

 NEV_vis_sunshine_rep2:0 "Renovate Hope Solar Array"
 NEV_vis_sunshine_rep2_desc:0 "Within our allies land lies an old wartime solar power plant. The lack of sunlight resulted in it being completely useless over the past two centuries, but it is well within our power to change that."
 
 NEV_vis_sunshine_rep3:0 "Build A Steel Mill In Their Capital"
 NEV_vis_sunshine_rep3_desc:0 "To help improve the industry of our fellow believers in freedom and democracy, we will invest in a steel mill within their capital. This also would allow them to expand their weapons industry, so as to better defend their liberty."

 cloudsdale.1.t:0 "The Grand Conspiracy"
 cloudsdale.1.d:0 "Unknown to even the Princess, throughout the Great War against Zebrica, a plan was being set in motion. A plan conceived by one of Equestria's core pony tribes: The pegasi. This plan was conceived solely by pegasi military, political, and industrial officials, and only a small hoofful outside of these types knew of it. The plan in question was the pegasi abandonment of Equestria, known as The Grand Conspiracy.\n The simple premise is that should Equestria lose the war against the zebras, or if balefire bombs reigned across the globe, the pegasi (mainly those of military, political, and industrial importance) would take to the skies and hide amongst the clouds as a fallback point, essentially leaving the rest of Equestria to their fate. There at least one third of Equestria's populous would remain unscathed, and from there they would organize and try to forge their own Equestria in their own image. If their plan was ever found out, those involved would of likely of been executed for treason against Equestria. However, their plan of betrayal was never discovered, and on the day the world ended, they were quick to put it into motion. \n This Conspiracy would result in the birth of all pegasi governments above the clouds, who all loosely banded together in a coalition known as:\nThe Enclave. \n In the planning phases of the Conspiracy there was a great deal of disagreement as to who should lead the new pegasi governments. Should it be the political and industrial officials who knew how to keep political stability and economic prosperity, or the military officers who knew how to keep strength and peace from within and without? Both factions managed to cling on to power in different parts of the Enclave, but only one managed to play a role in the founding of New Cloudsdale. That one was..."

 cloudsdale.1.b:0 "Politicians and Corporates"
 
 cloudsdale.2.t:0 "The Fateful Day"
 cloudsdale.2.d:0 "We knew the end was coming, we knew that despite the best efforts of the diarch it would all come crumbling down. We knew that whoever wins, we lose. The first great sign was Celestia's abdication, the next was the Zebrican response to Luna's ascension to the throne. Not even we know who fired the first megaspell, but it matters little now. What matters is the result: in the panic that following the end of the world, countless souls were lost, countless more found safety within the Stables or other forms of shelter, and we took to the skies. It was our plan all along to use the clouds to hide from the Tartarus below, and we assumed that the griffons or even the dragons wouldn't dare follow us into our own domain, and we were right. However, we lacked any real plan as to who or what to focus on saving as the end occured. Some urged us to gather as many pegasi as we could to save more lives, while others argued that we needed to gather as much military equipment and technology as we could so that we would have an uncontested military advantage once the dust settled. A split-second decision was made, and those who would go on to become our cities founders focused on saving... "
 cloudsdale.2.a:0 "As many pegasi as they could."
 cloudsdale.2.b:0 "Valuable military assets."
 
 cloudsdale.3.t:0 "The City of New Cloudsdale"
 cloudsdale.3.d:0 "Much to the horror and dismay of the surviving pegasi, the pegasus capital of the world, Cloudsdale, was one of the first cities vaporized by Zebrican balefire missiles on that fateful day. The survivors were eager to start anew and set to work building a new city. A 'New Cloudsdale', that would become the prime jewel of The Enclave, a city that pegasi from across the clouds of Equestria could look up to for hope. Now, southward of what little is left of Cloudsdale, flies the Great City of New Cloudsdale; a grand city that is as large as Old Cloudsdale and eventually grew to become one of the most powerful cities within the Enclave as a whole. The city of New Cloudsdale was a monument to and the pinnacle of the efforts of countless pegasi that had dedicated themselves to rebuilding Equestria in the Enclave's image. In the first years of New Cloudsdale's construction, it was a matter of great debate as to what the cities future would be: an advanced military industrial complex dedicated to manufacturing the Enclave's weapons, or a sprawling civilian metropolis with civilian industries and housing much similar to the old Cloudsdale? Eventually the bulk of New Cloudsdale was comprised of..."
 cloudsdale.3.a:0 "An advanced arms industry."
 cloudsdale.3.b:0 "A large civilian sector."
 
 cloudsdale.4.t:0 "The Featherfall Affair"
 cloudsdale.4.d:0 "General Featherfall has never been the most popular of pegasi. Despite this, he has at least been commonly regarded with the respect that is due of his position. His reputation as a rather stagnant leader has only helped aid in painting him as a stallion of moral character, who is not prone to falling to tempting pursuits of self-interest or momentary passion. That is, until recently. \n \n General Featherfall's less upstanding activities have recently become a matter of common speculation, rapidly growing into a dinner table topic for civilians and soldiers alike. Accusations of him selling officer appointments to the highest bidder paint the front of various popular newspapers, and many within the military itself are beginning to come forward to give accounts of his corruption. These accounts vary from claims of him pocketing military funds to him trading sexual favors for promotions. Needless to say, this controversy has rocked the Enclave to its very core, and has led to the public's faith in the Council being shaken. \n \n In response to this ongoing situation, a number of Senators have begun to call for an official investigation into Featherfall and his dealings. At the head of these is Senator Seafire, who has raised Tartarus from the start regarding this affair. On the other side of things, the respected warhero General Tornado has called this entire situation nothing but a hoax, being pushed by Featherfall's rivals as part of a political power grab. He now leads a minority within the Senate who are defending Featherfall's innocence."
 cloudsdale.4.a:0 "Something must change!"
 
 cloudsdale.5.t:0 "The Investigation"
 cloudsdale.5.d:0 "Seafire's investigation is no secret. Indeed, he has gone out of his way to ensure it was as publicised as possible, so as to drum up public support for it. This has led to a number of military officers coming forward to us with allegations, which has gone a long way towards cementing our case. Unfortunately, there has been little undeniable physical evidence of wrongdoing. Last night, an officer came to us with a claim that they were in possession of a great deal of hard evidence against not just Featherfall, but also the Council as a whole! They claim to have stashed a number of incriminating financial documents, internal memos, and even personal writings within an old military warehouse that stopped being used years ago. If this officer is speaking the truth, this amount of evidence would be more than enough to ensure that Featherfall is sent away for a long time. Furthermore, it would also incriminate several other high ranking military officials. \n \n Tonight, Seafire himself will be taking a team of trusted officers and investigating the warehouse. Upon getting there, they will find..."
 cloudsdale.5.a:0 "...files full of evidence."
 cloudsdale.5.b:0 "...an empty warehouse."
 
 cloudsdale.6.t:0 "The Case Against Featherfall"
 cloudsdale.6.d:0 "More than enough evidence has been presented to the Senate for them to approve a formal trial. Several lawyers have already been invited to join the investigation, and are now hard at work trying to build as solid of a legal case as possible against Featherfall. We expect to face considerable resistance in trying to convince the Senate of his wrongdoing, due to a number of older Senators being long-time supporters of his. While this process is ongoing, Senator Seafire has decided to take full advantage of this situation for his political efforts. All he must do now is decide whether he wants to focus on reminding the public that the Senate is here to deal with problems like this, or to push for the public to lose even more faith in the Council. Either choice would benefit his own political career, so it matters very little which he goes for."
 cloudsdale.6.a:0 "We should thank the Senate for ensuring our militaries integrity!"
 cloudsdale.6.b:0 "Let us never forget the Council's betrayal of our trust!"
 
 cloudsdale.7.t:0 "Meeting with Autumn Leaf"
 cloudsdale.7.d:0 "There's a knock on the door. Behind it lies none other than Colonel Autumn Leaf, here with an offer: his support in our endeavors, in exchange for a simple demand being met. His demand is for a sizable number of his supporters to be appointed to various ranking positions within the military. While this demand may be simple, and well within our power, it would also be a blatant act of corruption. The Colonel's views are also a matter of great concern, as he can hardly be considered a political ally. On the other hoof, the Colonel's support could be invaluable. He would grant us a voice on the Council itself, and his not inconsiderable amount of supporters will likely fall in line with whatever stance he takes."
 cloudsdale.7.a:0 "You've got a deal."
 cloudsdale.7.b:0 "Get the buck out of my office!"
 
 cloudsdale.8.t:0 "The Trial"
 cloudsdale.8.d:0 "Featherfall's Trial has attracted as much attention and commentary as the election itself, with every newspaper and tabloid from here to Las Pegasus talking about the event. It has become the topic of many heated debates between those who defend his innocence and those who call for his resignation and arrest. He has been brought forth before the Senate to be tried for his alleged crimes of bribery, embezzlement, and favor trading. To these charges, he pleads not-guilty. \n \n As the day progresses, a number of witnesses are called forward to testify for or against the General. Evidence is presented and refuted, heated arguments are had back and forth, and the room must be calmed on several occasions. After 9 hours straight of back and forth presenting, debating, and arguing, the Senate finally reaches a conclusion:"
 cloudsdale.8.a:0 "Featherfall has been declared guilty!"
 cloudsdale.8.b:0 "Featherfall has been declared guilty!"
 cloudsdale.8.c:0 "Featherfall has been declared guilty!"
 cloudsdale.8.e:0 "Featherfall has been declared not guilty!"
 
 cloudsdale.9.t:0 "On Voting Restrictions"
 cloudsdale.9.d:0 "One of the key features that sets the Enclave apart from Old Equestria is that every citizen holds the right to vote. Regardless of their city, wealth, or individual status, every citizen is able to cast a vote for their preferred representatives on both the High and Low Councils. Many across the Enclave considers this to be one of the core aspects of their society, an aspect that allows them to claim moral and philosophical superiority over the absolutist rule of the alicorns. Recent months have seen a surprising and worrying shift in opinion however. Several representatives have spoken out in favor of restricting the franchise, expanding the requirement of military service from the candidate to encompass the electorate as a whole. While this was initially met with outrage and outcries, the charismatic words of the fiery young Colonel Autumn have surprised many. Equally strong were the words of Senate Majority Leader, Seafire, who fiercely decried Autumn's proposal as regressive and undemocratic. The two clashed on the Senate floor earlier today, both making strong remarks in favor of their respective stances on the issue."
 cloudsdale.9.a:0 "Autumn Leaf takes the floor..."

 cloudsdale.10.t:0 "On the Population Crisis"
 cloudsdale.10.d:0 "The management of the population has been a significant issue since the formation of the Enclave, one that has plagued its society since its very inception. It began in the infamous 'Recovery Camps,' the desperate refugee camps that held those pegasi fortunate enough to escape Cloudsdale or the Surface. It continued on with the First Famine, an event so terrible that it killed an estimated one fifth of the population. Today, it has resulted in the strict control of reproduction by the state, the Enclave having maintained a strict two-child policy, aside from those who have earned the privilege of additional offspring. This question has shaped modern pegasi society, affecting general customs, perceptions, and even their approach to romantic relationships. The culture has adapted to meet the needs of the nation, generally manifesting in same-sex relationships being rewarded and tax breaks for those who choose not to have children. Despite this enormous cultural adaptation, the problem has continued to wear down the very foundation of the Enclave, the weight of the members it yearns to protect weighing it down... Recently, the issue has begun to boil over. As the strain of limited food supplies, cramped living space, and repressed sexual tension continue to bear down on the population, the pressure has become palpable. The Council and Senate have assembled today to address this issue once more, the tightly packed room serving as yet another reminder of the ever present issue. Today, the primary clash is between General Featherfall, of the Justice and Order Party, and General Tornado, a long term advocate for unity within the Enclave. \n While many of those present expect this to be yet another repeat of the arguments made in the past, today will be somewhat more significant..."
 cloudsdale.10.a:0 "..."
 
 cloudsdale.11.t:0 "Neverending Scarcity"
 cloudsdale.11.d:0 "Life above the clouds is defined by scarcity. This is a simple fact, one inherent to the environment itself. Despite all of this, the ponies of the Enclave have been able to scrounge up the resources they need, making use of anything and everything available. Water is extracted from the clouds themselves, cloud seeding allows for a meager source of food, and the few remaining mountain peaks allowed for a source of minerals, though they have long since been depleted. \nDespite these factors, life is still hard. The entirety of the Enclave's existence revolves around the struggle to survive, a struggle that has continued since its very foundation, one born in the hunger and sickness of the recovery camps, a struggle that continued even as they rebuilt. Due to this never ending conflict against nature itself, the Enclave has a unique appreciation for the true value of solid matter. \nWhat many below might see as trash is carefully stockpiled, managed, and allotted to fit the needs of the society. From there, it is transformed to meet the needs of the society, whatever they may be. It is used to its fullest extent, long beyond what many would see as reasonable. When it finally expires, its use having been extinguished, it is not simply discarded. It is returned to the stockpiles, broken down into its base components, and recycled in any way possible.\nToday, two factions have come together to debate an issue that will transform the Enclave forever: The issue of obtaining resources from the surface. This issue that has the potential to end the great struggle, finally let the children of the sky claim the birthright they have so long been promised. To claim the birthright of their foals, to ensure that the pegasi of the Enclave never again have to suffer under the endless scarcity of the sky. The decision made here today will steer the course of the Enclave into the future, whatever it may be."
 cloudsdale.11.a:0 "Tornado speaks..."
 
 cloudsdale.37.t:0 "Tornado's Speech"
 cloudsdale.37.d:0 "General Tornado stands still behind the podium, his features cold and schooled as he collects his thoughts, using his one good eye to examine the crowd before him. The stallion is dressed in his iconic armor, the wear and tear on its surface showcasing a lifetime of service to his people. With a deep breath, he speaks. "We must understand the importance of our decision here, for it will define our future. I understand that there are those that propose things such as trading for the resources we require to survive. In a perfect world, we would descend to the world below, exchanging kind words with those dwelling there. Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world. The world is as we find it. You have to deal with that reality, that there are monsters in this world. There are countless numbers below that would love nothing more than to expand their reach to our havens, to kill, rape, and maim as they will. To spread their demented chaos to our cities, to tear us down to their level. And yet, you object when I refuse to kiss these monsters on the cheek and say 'pretty please' as we beg them for the resources we need to survive? Tell me, which of the ponies here would you put in harm's way so you wouldn't seem like a nasty fella?" He locks eyes with Seafire, staring him down for a moment before continuing to speak. "I will not apologize for trying to keep your families safe. And I will not apologize for trying to do what needs to be done to ensure that your families can sleep safely at night. It has been my honor to be the servant of the Enclave, it has been my honor to be a servant of our people. As a General of the Enclave, it is my sworn duty to do what is right by our people, to ensure that we can survive. For the last two hundred years, we have endlessly struggled to ensure that chaos and despair never again darken our doorstep. We have failed in the past, but this struggle has made us who we are. There is only one true source of victory in this struggle, honored colleagues." He allows a long pause, staring out at the assembled ponies."
 cloudsdale.37.a:0 "..."
 
 cloudsdale.41.t:0 "Tornado Continues"
 cloudsdale.41.d:0 ""We must take what we need. The Surface has all the resources it could ever desire in excess. Yet despite this, they are little more than a series of vicious raiders, meagre communities, and brutal warlords. They have all the resources they could ever desire, enough to ensure that every pony could live a safe and stable life. Yet, despite this, they are little more than savages, playing in the shadow of a greater civilization. Our civilization. We have nothing but what our forefathers have left for us, nothing but the resources we have been able to gather with our own hooves. Yet despite this, we are the pinnacle of Equestrian civilization, a beacon of strength, freedom, and order across the Wasteland. Now, this isn't to say that they are all savages, sadists, and barbarians. I've been to the Surface before, I can tell you that there are still plenty of good ponies down there." He offers a light smile to the crowd, surprising many present with a rare show of emotion. "However, the vast majority of them aren't. The vast majority aren't simply trying to carve a life for themselves in the uncaring Wasteland. No, they use it to slay, oppress, and torture their fellow pony. They use it to establish a cruel dominion over those unwilling to use the very same tactics. This, above all things, justifies our right to seize what we need, nay, deserve from those that would abuse it. The resources below could end our struggle, not in the ever present threat of defeat, but in the golden light of victory. We could win a final victory, end the constant state of scarcity that has haunted our people. All we need to do is understand that it is ours for the taking. That it belongs to you. This is your birthright my friends. All we need to do is take it." There is a moment of silence before the speech was greeted with thunderous applause."
 cloudsdale.41.a:0 "Seafire speaks..."
 
 cloudsdale.42.t:0 "Seafire's Speech"
 cloudsdale.42.d:0 "Seafire looked out upon the cheering crowds, disheartened but not discouraged. The path of the peacemaker was never easy, though he would never trade it for anything else. He understood that if he didn't take up this path, few others would. With his signature grin, Seafire steps up as Tornado offers him the podium, offering him a courteous nod as he does. Turning to the assembled representatives, he waits for them to quiet down before beginning to speak, his voice was smooth and calm despite his previous misgivings.\n"Hello again friends. I have to say, I am rather impressed by the passion of General Tornado's proposal, if not its contents. As, while he has the right idea, he's approaching it in the wrong way. The way that would see us descend to their level, making use of violence to enforce our will upon those less fortunate than ourselves. Haven't we learned better than that? This isn't to say that the resource issue isn't the core of our societies woes: I think we're all smart enough to see the truth in that regard, so I don't feel a pressing need to say what has already been said. I and those aligned with me believe that what General Tornado here proposes is morally wrong, though we don't necessarily disagree with his argument as a whole. We do live in an imperfect world."\nHe grins at the crowd for a moment. \n"We wouldn't be stuck up here if it was perfect! But, as he said, we don't live in a perfect world. He came to the conclusion that, as a result of this imperfection, we need to make use of force to take what we need. I see it a different way. I see it as yet another example of the world urging us to aspire to perfection, to seek to be better than we are. We have in our hooves immense power to do both good and evil, power that we have refrained from using due to fear of the unknown. I would not suggest that we greet the unknown with open hooves, for that would be foalish. Instead, I suggest that we offer a hoof in greeting. After all, we have plenty to give that isn't our resources...""
 cloudsdale.42.a:0 "..."

 cloudsdale.38.d:0 "He gestures to the Senate Hall's towering ceiling and carefully crafted walls, drawing their attention to the grandeur of its construction. "The sky is a harsh mistress, my friends. But, while she takes much from us, she also grants us much in return, even if it isn't obvious. For example, let's look to the sun. We experience sunlight every day up here, it's a normal part of life. Down there? They live in our shadow. They dream of the sun, of the warmth it brings on a cool spring day. What about water? That's one of the things we've always had more than enough, isn't it? Did you know that ponies down below die of thirst of all things? Can't we make it literally fall from the sky? On that topic, what about storms? They're a bit of thunder to us, but nothing serious. To them, it's a terrifying onslaught from the sky, pounding down upon their measly little homes. We control each of these things, don't we? So why not use them? We don't need to give up our resources to get what we need, we merely need to barter with the sky itself. We need some food to shore up the emergency rations? Let's offer a settlement three months of sunlight in exchange for that. What about that replacement part for the Raptor? That'll be a season of rain, just for you! Some more medical supplies? The next group of raiders that comes for your little settlement surely won't enjoy being struck by lightning, no?" He chuckles, bringing a hoof down on the cloud. "We live upon the greatest economic potential in the wasteland! Let's use it! We can maintain our dignity, maintain our way of life, all while enhancing it with goods from the surface. Even better, we can do it with a clean conscious, all while staying true to our valued principles! Tornado means well, but his method is crude and unnecessarily violent. By simply making use of our monopoly over weather, we can achieve so much more at a nearly negligible cost. Who wouldn't want that?"\nHe gives the crowd his best smile, holding it awkwardly as the seconds tick on. Finally, somepony begins stomping their hooves, starting an avalanche of applause that equaled that of Tornado. With a cheery nod to his dour opponent, Seafire returned to his seat as the Senate began to cast their votes."

 cloudsdale.12.t:0 "On Wastelander Rights"
 cloudsdale.12.d:0 "The issue of Wastelanders has always been a touchy subject within Enclave society, one that is often relegated to arguments around the dinner table rather than serious discussion within the halls of government. Today, however, this has changed. For the first time in history, the Senate has been called together to discuss this issue at the behest of none other than Majority Leader Seafire, the most prominent progressive reformist in New Cloudsdale. While many have grumbled about the session, even more have attended, drawn forth by distaste, association, or curiosity.\n---\nWith the majority of the Senate gathered, Seafire has emerged from his cluster of allies and proteges, ready to present his case in favor of the Wastelanders. The murmured conversation comes to a halt as he arrives at the podium, taking up a position behind and offering his trademark smile to the assembled pegasi. \n"Hello again friends! I'm glad so many of you could make it here today, given the short notice. With how many of you are packed in here, I assume that you're already familiar with the topic of today: Wastelanders. Now, this is always something that we've been hesitant to talk about. I mean, unless you're Colonel Autumn or one of his cronies, but that's a side note. In all seriousness, I think it's very important that we discuss this now rather than later, given everything that's happening. With all the changes going on now, we may have to have a solid policy towards the Surface much sooner than we first thought, which is really a terrifying thought. I mean, these are ponies that we haven't really interacted with properly in two centuries. And when it comes down to it, that's the core of this. They're ponies, not Wastelanders.""

 cloudsdale.39.d:0 "He looks out at the crowd, surveying their expressions. For the most part, he was met with boredom, neutrality, and active malice from Autumn's clique. Nothing unexpected, so he continued on.\n"And yes, I mean what I said. We treat them like they're some different species, that they are intrinsically different than us. Admittedly, there are a number of cultural differences, but that doesn't change the simple fact that at our core, we are all still ponies. The main thing that sets us apart on a biological level is the fact that we have a pair of wings and less radiation. Beyond that, we're pretty much the same. Now, on an actual personal level, that's where we run into issues. It's a simple fact that we are, on average, healthier, stronger, better educated, more disciplined, and more civilized than the vast majority of ponies on the Surface. This is something that can't be ignored as it places a natural barrier between us. But we also can't ignore that they are ponies, just like you and me. We can't ignore that over a thousand years ago, we were faced with a similar situation. And once again, we can't ignore that the pony tribes only achieved true prosperity by working past their differences and acknowledging one another as equal in nature, if not in ability."\nThe room is silent as his dialogue becomes increasingly radical, though some appear to be intrigued by his words.\n"I believe that if we approach these ponies as inherently equal, we can forge a better world for our foals. Of course, we must maintain a degree of separation, our cultural differences would make full integration impossible, but we should certainly take steps to bridge that gap. To acknowledge that we aren't inherently superior due to the wings on our backs. That maybe, just maybe, they are worthy of some compassion as well."\n---\nHe concludes, preparing to stop, before reconsidering. "

 cloudsdale.40.t:0 "Seafire Continues"
 cloudsdale.40.d:0 ""Something else I wanted to talk about, on the topic of compassion. Dashites. We all know them, we all hate them, right? But why? What does that punishment actually mean?" As he continued on, he drew increasingly incredulous stares from the audience, his proteges gaping in surprise at the unplanned tangent. "Yes, I understand that it means banishment, but why do we practice it? Why do we honor some mare that abandoned us two hundred years ago by ensuring that she is remembered by those that would happily follow in her footsteps? And most of all, why do we punish those whose only crime is compassion with something like that? Now, I'm not saying that traitors like Deadshot Calamity should be forgiven, they committed actual crimes after all. No, what I don't get is why ponies like Radar are punished for being willing to perform a simple act of kindness. That's what got his banished after all, isn't it? Dropping medical supplies to a dying mare? Who wouldn't do that?" The shock has started to fade, with some staring in anger, others in consideration, while that vast majority sit in an awkward sort of silence. "What I mean is this: the term Dashite only serves as another way to separate us from ponies on the Surface. To remember how a mare betrayed our entire civilization two hundred years ago. Let's forget her. Let's forget the brand. Let's forget this concept as a whole! Empathy shouldn't be punished, it's only natural that you feel for your fellow ponies! If somepony commits a crime serious enough to warrant a greater punishment, just dust them! Don't make them a martyr and release them into the wild, that only makes them more dangerous. What I'd suggest is a... reconciliation of sorts with those that were cast out preemptively. That way, we can start healing this wound that ancient betrayal left."\n---\nThe crowd is silent, many still processing what was just said. While they had expected a defense of the wastelanders, nopony, not even his allies, had expected him to come out in favor of the Dashites. Finally, the reactions began to filter through..."
 cloudsdale.40.a:0 "Angry jeering, as the crowd rejects Seafire's ideas wholesale."

A few decades ago, skirmishes were even breaking out between our two militaries, leading many to theorize that an outright war could erupt. However, much has changed since then. In a bizarre twist of fate, a representative from the Cumulus-Federatia has now come before the Senate to plead for our aid. \n \n 'Hello, Senators of New Cloudsdale. My name is Fairwing, and I have come here before you on behalf of all cities within the Cumulus-Federatia to request your aid. Our cities are currently going through the worst famine we have seen in centuries, with pegasi being lucky to get a meager meal once every other day. Our resources are scarce, even more so than in the rest of the Enclave. And many of our cities still lay in partial ruin, being unable to repair that which was damaged during the Griffon War. I know you do not have a great abundance yourselves, and I fully recognize that you must look after your own first and foremost. But I plead of you to consider giving what you can to help us in our own plight. If not for our cities, then for our pegasi. Thank you.'"

 cloudsdale.14.t:0 "The Skyfreeze Issue"
 cloudsdale.14.d:0 "Skyfreeze is the newest power within the Enclave, rising to such a status due in large part to their rather controversial policies regarding those on the Surface. Rather than ignore the Surface, they have instead set out to utilize it to solve their needs: food, resources, and the ponies needed to produce them. Several of the older Senators despise them going to the Surface at all, while many of the younger ones object to them treating those below as nothing more than slaves. Until recently, this matter was kept solely to the Senate. \n \n The recent industrial boom Skyfreeze has experienced put an end to that. Our projections show that they may very well surpass us within a generation, if not sooner. This has led to the Council also getting involved, joining the Senate for several sessions to discuss the best approach to take towards the troublesome city. One such session has been planned to occur today, with a representative from Skyfreeze itself coming to speak on their behalf. \n \n To one side of the Senate Hall sat the Council, quietly talking among themselves. Autumn's clique and the Featherfall's crowd were notably grouped as far from one another as they could be, while still staying to their side of the room. On the other side sat the Senate, with Seafire positioned at the center and Tornado as close to the Council as he could be. Various political observations and judgements could be made about their seating arrangements, but that wouldn't be what would capture the headlines today. \n \n The chatter and conversations were brought to an abrupt halt as the great doors to the Senate Hall were opened. A military escort trotted in, with an officer dressed in the colors of Skyfreeze stepping forward. All eyes were on the officer, with many in the room growing nervous that they had sent a military representative. He began to speak: 'Now announcing the representative of Skyfreeze: First Citizen Brightwing!'"
 cloudsdale.14.a:0 "The stallion himself enters the room."
 
 cloudsdale.142.t:0 "Brightwing's Speech"
 cloudsdale.142.d:0 "Reactions varied from bafflement to outcry, with the Council and Senate alike descending into trying to shout over one another. Stepping into the room was First Citizen Brightwing, the leader of Skyfreeze himself! The two beacons of order within the room were, surprisingly enough, Autumn Leaf and Seafire. Both set about calming down their sides, bringing enough quiet for Brightwing to speak. The stallion himself wasted no time representing his city. \n \n 'Hello, mares and gentlestallions of New Cloudsdale. You already know that I am First Citizen Brightwing, humble civil servant to the fine ponies of Skyfreeze. I have come here today to represent their interests, for that is my very job as First Citizen. I know many of you have expressed very vocal concerns regarding the state of our lovely city. Rest assured, I have in fact read all of the public statements and interviews to be published in your papers. I have also listened to the diplomats that have been sent to us, both from you, and from just about every other city within the Enclave. I have listened, and I am now here to respond. \n \n First, I would like to address the simpler matter at hoof: morality. Some have had rather sharp words to share regarding our treatment of the Surface dwellers. I see Senator Seafire among you, who has published a rather scathing criticism about it himself. To these concerns, I simply say that we are helping those under our rule just as much as they help us. We provide them with food, shelter, and most importantly of all, purpose. Without us, they would be living in radioactive squalor! Would you see them stripped of that? Stripped of these luxuries, and thrown back into the full harshness of Surface life? \n \n Now, to address your real concern: our prosperity. Yes, I know full well that you see us as a rival, a potential enemy even. But I give you not just my word, but the word of everypony in Skyfreeze, that we have no ill intent towards our fellow cities. We are largely disinterested in the affairs of the greater Enclave, and we will leave you and every other city be. With that, I will take any questions you may have.' \n \n The room once again erupted into shouting."

 cloudsdale.15.t:0 "The Volunteer Issue"
 cloudsdale.15.d:0 "One of the primary factors leading to the formation of the Enclave was the conscription policies of Equestria. Many young pegasi were forced to fight and die for a cause that wasn't their own. This rapidly led to anti-Equestrian sentiments, and would eventually result in the skies being sealed off.\nDue to such, it has always been a firm policy of the Enclave to not engage in any sort of conscription. Only those who were fully willing would serve their country. At one time, this led to a very loyal and almost ideologically fanatic military. However, the various benefits and moderate pay offered to soldiers and veterans alike has led to a massive influx of recruits over recent years. While some may consider a large army to be desirable, others have begun to voice their concerns regarding this situation. \nMany of those within the political sphere are worried about the drain on resources a larger military would present, as well as this taking potential workers away from various civilian industries. Meanwhile, some within the military itself are concerned about this affecting the quality of the military as a whole. After all, a larger army is not necessarily a better one.\nThe issue has become such a matter of debate that the Council has been forced to make a decision regarding it. They could carry on as is, allowing recruits to flood in. Alternatively, they could set a limit on yearly recruitment. This would solve the situation, but it would also result in a lower pool of ponypower to draw from, in the event of any conflict breaking out."

 cloudsdale.16.d:0  ""Preposterous! The outpost is fine as it is, and has been for 200 years!" Featherfall shouts, fixing his suit. "But you don't realize that the outpost is too weak there, we might as well just evacuate and place our soldiers in a more important location!" Autumn Leaf says as the board room goes quiet except for the slight murmurs of other generals. "The outpost is crucial for the further development of our influence over the area, if we leave it as is, where the hell would our other soldiers go? We can't just station those thousands of soldiers elsewhere. In the current situation, they can very much defend themselves.." Featherfall says to the board, rupturing the silence. "That is the reason we must reinforce it, it is the only one there. It is entirely vulnerable to attack from all around, at any minute the outpost's supply lines could be disrupted and we could lose, as you said, a few thousand well-armed and well-trained soldiers!" Autumn Leaf refutes, stirring more murmurs into the board room. A third Councillor enters the argument with his own take: "What about the energy shield we have there? That's got no way of breaking anytime soon. With the shield up no bandit, fauna, or enemy could think of puncturing our defences there." Featherfall is quick to latch onto this point and adds, "Precisely, with the energy shield, nobody could possibly think they could actually take the outpost or even dispose of the soldiers there. It's defended, and it's important to us keeping our influence over that region." He finished, chuckling to himself and his side of the room. It seemed that the issues was cleared, as Autumn Leaf seemed to have backed down from the dispute, lightly talking with his peers, until another officer from Autumn's side stood. "The energy shield could aid in the defence, but it won't instantly repel any attack on it, so we need to add extra soldiers for protection." Autumn himself takes this opportunity to chime up, "Yes, what if we lose that energy shield? After all, we have no idea what's powering it and no way to restore it should it fail! We must have pegasi ready to guard the outpost!" he says and the board room is once again thrown into a stir of officers voicing their opinions and both sides trying to talk over each other. "

 cloudsdale.17.t:0 "The EPA Thunderous"
 cloudsdale.17.d:0 "The largest of the Enclave's cloudships are the Thunderheads, each of which is capable of acting as a mobile fortress in the sky. One of the largest of these is the EPA Thunderous, a truly immense construct intended to serve as a mobile command center during the War. It was planned to serve as a capital ship for the Equestrian Airfleet, and Princess Luna herself was expected to take up command within it once the War was all but won. Unfortunately, the War wasn't won, and Princess Luna only witnessed the ship once during its construction. It never got to see battle, with it being completed only a week before balefire consumed the world. \n \n Our city was quick to claim it upon the formation of the Enclave, and it proved a valuable tool early in our history for detering more desperate cities from trying anything against us. It also proved itself during several conflicts with griffons, most recently being deployed to defend the lands of the Cumulus-Federatia during their war. While this has led to it becoming an icon of our miltiary might, it has also left the mighty cloudship in a less than ideal condition. Our best engineers are barely holding it together, with a healthy amount of jury rigging and duct tape, and we fear that it may just fall out of the sky soon. As a result, the Council has decided to retire the beast of a ship. All that must be decided now is what to actually do with it. \n \n The two most popular proposals come from Autumn Leaf and Featherfall. Autumn has called for the whole thing to simply be scrapped, with all of its components being melted down and turned into raw material to fuel our industry. However, Featherfall argues that it could continue to serve our military as a training facility. The rest of the Council must decide which proposal to go for..."

 cloudsdale.18.t:0 "Autumn and Featherfall Butt Heads"
 cloudsdale.18.d:0 "Every year for the past 143 years, New Cloudsdale has held an annual military parade to bolster support for our armed forces. Over all that time, the parade has changed very little. The lineup, the amount of soldiers marching, the uniforms they wear, and the weapons they wield have all remained the same since the very first parade. This year, however, Autumn Leaf has called for an addition to the parade: a wing of Raptors flying overhead, dragging a massive flag behind them. Featherfall, being ever the practicalist, has voiced his strong opposition to this idea. A strong opposition that rapidly devolved into a shouting match between the two. \n \n As Featherfall slammed his hoof down, he let his words fly out with a reckless abandon that threw many of the older Council members aback. 'And where the buck do you intend on getting enough fabric to make such a flag!? We can hardly afford to give uniforms to all of our officers, let alone supply this vanity project of yours!' Autumn Leaf was quick to respond, with matching anger: 'Our officers can go without then! This is much more than a 'vanity project' - it is a way to remind all pegasi of our might!' \n \n Their heated debate raged on for hours, devolving at one point into Featherfall flipping a table and Autumn Leaf throwing a chair across the room. The rest of the Council stood on the sidelines, spectating the two and whispering among themselves. Evenetually, they all came to one conclusion:"

This is a matter of utmost importance, one that may directly affect the continued survival of not just the Council, but the Enclave as a whole!' At this, the entire Council was brought to attention. Looks varied from ones of concern to ones of open alarm, as such a matter was never to be taken lightly. Even Featherfall, usually quick to dismiss anything Autumn claimed, was now intently listening to every word.\n \n 'Yes, it has come to my attention that there is a grave threat to both us and our city as a whole. A threat so cunning and insidious, it can convince our ponies that it is saving them, even as it damns them! A threat so powerful, it stands capable of destroying our very way of life! I am referring to none other than the Senate itself!' This left nothing but stunned silence, as every member of the Council struggled to process what he had just said. Before they could recover, he continued: 'Time and time again, they have sought to strip away our power. Time and time again, they have called to cut our budget, or to do away with military assets. They would see us fully disarmed, our city left unguarded, and our ponies powerless! If we wish to ensure the continued survival of not just ourselves, but also our city as a whole, we must take action against this threat!'"

 cloudsdale.20.t:0 "The Strategy to Deal With Red Eye"
 cloudsdale.20.d:0 "Today, the Council has convened to discuss a matter most serious: the first true military challenger of the Enclave. While they have faced and defeated countless foes in the past, they have never before been confronted with a faction capable of leveraging an equal level of industrial might. While many within the Council are dismissive of the actual danger presented by the warlord known as Red Eye, Colonel Autumn and General Tornado have come together in a rare show of agreement, both arguing that Red Eye is an existential threat to the Enclave's way of life. Today, the two stand together on the Council floor in a rare break in tradition, specifically with the intent of showing the severity of the situation. Tornado's mouth remained in its usual jagged frown, a sharp contrast to Autumn's iconic smile. The two lock eyes, Autumn's light brown eyes meeting Tornado's yellow ones. The two hold the position for a moment in a silent battle of wills before Autumn finally looks down, allowing Tornado to finally look to the waiting Council, his face still stoic. Without pause, he begins to speak, his voice a low grumble as he orates to the assembled officers.\n-\n"Good morning, honored colleagues. Today, Colonel Autumn and I have come before you to discuss a master of utmost importance: that of the Wasteland warlord known as Red Eye. I understand that many of you don't consider this individual or his supporters to be a threat. I also understand that you would have to be incredibly shortsighted in order to fail to perceive the threat he poses to our way of life. As it stands, this individual is simultaneously in possession of the largest military force, industrial center, and population in the wasteland. As it stands, he is second only to us in total strength. Even though we easily eclipse him on every front, it's important to understand the significance of this: for the first time in two hundred years, there is a power capable of challenging us. One capable of martialing the manpower and industry of a developed nation to wage war against their enemies. One that has shown itself to be intent on expansion and continued reclamation, one that has actively declared its intent to forcibly reunite the former Equestrian nation. As it stands, there is absolutely no way that Red Eye can attack us at home. But I have no doubt that fact will change within the next two decades or so, given his current rate of expansion. It is of extreme importance that we ensure our security, now, and forever. Now, I'd ask that you turn your attention to Colonel Autumn." "

 cloudsdale.49.t:0 "Autumn's Turn"
 cloudsdale.49.d:0 "Tornado offers the Council a dour nod, stepping away from the platform to allow Autumn a chance to speak. Autumn offers him a polite nod, his face locked in a neutral expression as he steps forward. In less than a second, his expression has transformed from an emotionless line to a glimmering grin as he meets the eyes of the Council.\n-\n"Thank you for that speech, General Tornado. I think we can all agree that he laid out some of our key arguments here. Now, I feel the need to reinforce the words of General Tornado here: Red Eye poses an existential threat to our way of life going forward. While it seems absurd, I know, he has managed to rally together enough wasteland mongrels to actually pose a threat to our city." There is a long pause as he stops to think for a moment, a few among the audience preparing to respond, before he continues to speak. "With that in mind, it is important that we act. Now, I understand that Tornado intends to put forward a plan of action that would see us striking high ranking officials and key strategic structures within the warlord's territory: this will not be sufficient. As much as I would like to end this quickly and quietly, their forces are much too potent for us to cripple with simple assassinations. They make use of artificially created alicorns, hellishly mutated diamond dogs, and incredibly brutal mercenaries. Even without their leadership, these threats will continue to exist. No, what we need is to put a stop to this once and for all. I propose that we begin drafting plans for a Surface intervention, effective immediately. The deployment of raptors and Enclave boots on the ground will be necessary to win this war, I guarantee it. I'll cede the floor to Tornado, but I ask that you keep the shortsightedness of his plan in mind as he speaks." Autumn saunters down from the podium, smirking at Tornado as he does, ignoring the shining cybernetic eye staring back at him. With Tornado fuming, Autumn takes up a position at the side of the podium, allowing the older general to speak."

 cloudsdale.50.d:0 "\n-\n"As my... colleague before me said, action will be required to face this new threat. That action must be decisive and swift, for our enemy grows ever stronger on a daily basis. What Autumn proposes, however, is not the solution. If he had his way, we would be mired in a series of never ending wars, sending our youth to go fight and die in the worthless pit that is the Wasteland. And yes, I say war, for that is what it will be. He wants us to sally out and fight, rather than playing to our strengths. He wants to stand us in a conflict that will kill thousands of our citizens on one of the most brutal battlefields imaginable." Tornado stares out at the cloud, his Wasteland wounds supplementing the argument he presents. "He wants this so he can benefit politically. He desires glory and strength and is willing to sacrifice our valiant soldiers to achieve it. I would propose a series of lightning strikes to cripple Red Eye's raider army before it can grow further in its strength. What we need is to eliminate this threat: not to draw it out and create a protracted campaign. If you approve my plan, honored colleagues, I will begin preparing the necessary shock troops for their descent. That is all." As he steps down, the assembled members of the Council begin a fierce debate over the merits of both proposals.""

He went on to assure the public that he would do his best to ensure that these ideals were maintained, as New Cloudsdale marched ever on into the future. \n \n Following the conclusion of his speech, General Featherfall joined him on stage to give a surprise speech of his own. The good General, who has faithfully served the Enclave for longer than many of our ponies have been alive, has decided that now is the time to step down. He granted Tornado his full endorsement, and named him his successor as the General of the Enclave.

He gave a rousing victory speech to a large crowd of his supporters in honor of his victory, during which he called for everypony to remember the very ideals that the Enclave was built upon. He went on to assure the public that he would do his best to ensure that these ideals were maintained, as New Cloudsdale marched ever on into the future. \n \n Featherfall's removal from the Council has created a prime opportunity for Tornado. The Council currently stands divided, with their support split mainly between Tornado himself and Autumn Leaf. If Autumn were to be removed from the Council, there would be no real opposition left, and General Tornado's rule would be secured."

 cloudsdale.25.t:0 " Autumn Leaf on Voting Restrictions"
 cloudsdale.25.d:0 "Autumn, the proposals most prominent advocate, spoke first, as he paced across the open floor of the Senate Hall. Clothed in the traditional Enclave dress uniform, the colonel cut an imposing figure as he delivered his fiery speech.\n "As we move forward, we must accept the simple fact that by permitting irresponsible authority, we are selling ourselves to disaster! For the last two hundred years, we have placed our trust with those that have the experience and discipline of military service to lead us, allowing them to guide our path through history! For the last two hundred years, they have done so with a level of skill, honor, and strength found nowhere else within history. Their sage guidance has allowed us to move forward from the Recovery Camps of old, it allowed us to emerge from the tainted dust of the old world unscathed. For two hundred years, we have trusted them to guide us into the future, a trust that they have proven and reciprocated ten times over. As it stands, we are on the brink of a new era for our people, one that will define how we are remembered by history. We can not afford to falter at this most delicate point, to weaken ourselves by accepting the opinion of those that lack the honor of service on an equal level. We require military service for a reason: it serves as the ultimate test of character. Without this protection, our democracy would have failed long ago, swept aside by the taint of radical populism that Seafire so eagerly endorses. What I propose today would expand the requirements we place upon the candidates to the base of the system itself, allowing us to raise the electorate the meet the quality of those that they choose to govern. Then, and only then, can we truly move forward into our new era, assured that we will not falter when we are tested!"\n Autumn completes his speech with a furious stamp of his hoof, taking a long moment to gaze up at the assembled Senators and Councilors. \n "I rest my case." "

 cloudsdale.26.t:0 "Seafire on Voting Restrictions"
 cloudsdale.26.d:0 "Seafire rises to his hooves as Autumn withdraws into his clique, fading from view. With a sigh, he advances to the podium, dressed in his formal suit, a stark contrast to the Colonel's uniform. With a practiced smile, he begins to address the crowd. \n"Citizens. Soldiers. Friends. We meet here today in the halls of New Cloudsdale, the capital of our people. It wasn't always our capital though. Two hundred years ago, that right was reserved for the first Cloudsdale, the greatest city our people ever knew. Within those vaunted halls, some of the greatests dramas of history played out. Commander Hurricane led the conquest of the pegasi tribes, forging us into a united people. Commander Ironhead led his legendary defense against the dragon menace, driving them back from the ancient bastion at the center of the city. Flash Magnus ensured the continuation of that unity in the uncertain times of the Shadow War. Despite all of this history, the city was destroyed in a single stroke. It wasn't our fault though. No... "\n He offers a grim smile to the silent crowd, allowing the tension to draw out as the seconds continued on... \n"No, it wasn't our fault my friends. We had merely done our duty, done what was expected of us. We did not decide to start the war with the zebras! We did not choose to plunge our nation into battle after a hundred decades of undisturbed peace! We did not choose the develop the weapons that would end our world! No... that was the choice of the alicorns. As a result of their arrogance, their zealotry, and their absolute rule, they plunged our nation into a war that would destroy the world. What Autumn is calling for today? It would do the same. He proposes stripping the power away from the ponies, placing it solely in the hooves of a singular organization, an organization that holds loyalty to him alone. Not only would he cast aside our most treasured tradition of democracy for this unseemly ambition, he would do so with the intent of permanently eradicating the franchise to secure his grip."\n"The issue before us today is not one of simple politics. It is one of survival. Not for our people, as Autumn so brazenly suggests, but for our culture and the very beliefs it is based upon. Autumn would have us cast that aside, embracing the authoritarianism that destroyed our world in the past. It is our job, our duty to deny those that would destroy what we hold most dear. Our democracy must be not only the envy of the wasteland but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with the Enclave that cannot be cured by what is right with Enclave. I rest my case and urge my colleagues here to make the right decision.""

 cloudsdale.27.t:0 "Featherfall's Speech"
 cloudsdale.27.d:0 "General Featherfall begins, slowly making his way over the central podium, his back left leg dragging behind him, an injury obtained during the Griffon Incursion. He surveys the crowd for several seconds, taking a sip from the glass of water positioned on the podium by an aid before beginning to speak, his voice dry and dismissive. \n"The issue that has come before the Council today is one that has been repeated by a hundred different ponies a hundred different times. I've lived through countless movements just like this one. I've lived to see them fade, as their champions realize the foolishness of their proposals and quietly withdraw from the political scene, doing their best to hide their shame. The only truly surprising aspect of this iteration of the argument is the stallion making it: I truly expected better from General Tornado. Though I suppose heroism doesn't necessarily bring wisdom. I'll make this fast and simple, my colleagues." He drags his tired gaze across the ponies assembled, allowing them to clearly see his disdain for the topic at hoof. "Let's break down the reasons presented. I admit, some of the concerns are legitimate, but others are just... decadent. In regards to the stretched food supplies, I will point to historical precedent. Things have always been difficult, though we have always prevailed. The last actual famine was forty years ago, lasting only a few short months before our rationing was able to address it once more. That's a simple fact of life here in the sky, one that won't change regardless of our feelings in that regard. Toughen up and understand the reality of the situation, ponies. As for living space? Please. We live in the greatest conditions left in the world, conditions more luxurious than those on the ground could even dream of. Stop letting your greed dictate your actions. It is not befitting of you. Finally... I hesitate to even address this point, though I feel I must given the emphasis you have placed upon it." He allows a long pause, directing an accusatory gaze towards the ponies in the audience. "The fact that you see... sexual satisfaction as a serious issue speaks poorly of you. Is the younger generation so promiscuous and hedonistic that they can think of nothing other than the... bonking on a cloud speaks poorly of your generation. That this is an issue shows the blatant irresponsibility of those assembled, the sheer inability to control their... base impulses! Shame on you all!" \nHe waves his hoof at the now utterly silent Council, trudging back towards the bench, ignoring their stunned stares as he hefts himself onto the cloudy seat, grunting with effort as he adjusts his leg."

 cloudsdale.28.t:0 "Tornado's Speech"
 cloudsdale.28.d:0 "In the midst of the silence, Tornado stood, instantly drawing attention to him with his sudden movement. He took the time to survey the crowd, his glowing prosthetic eye an imposing sight to the younger representatives present. Finally, he began to make his way down to the podium, his gait still steady despite his advanced age, a result of the advanced training regimine he still practiced to this day. \nWhen he finally reached the podium, he stood in silence for several moments before speaking, his traditional Enclave dress uniform still pristine, despite its obvious age, the gleaming medals that lined his chest only adding to its luster. With an abrupt nod, he begins to speak, his powerful voice commanding attention from all those present. \n"Twelve years ago, our people suffered as our ancestors did as famine once more laid low our great city. Twelve years ago, an estimated ten thousand ponies died of starvation. This problem has always plagued our people and so long as we sit here and refuse to address it, it shall continue to do so. General Featherfall proposes that we do just that: sit here and wait for yet another famine to strike our city, sunder our home, and wither our people. We can and must prevent the tragedy of famine in the future instead of merely trying to salvage the equine wreckage of the famine with pious regret and empty promises. How much longer will we have to wait until someone is willing to take decisive action to address this most pressing issue? How long must we wait until the Council does what needs to be done?"\nHis voice rises in both volume and tempo as he speaks, his eyes locked with the enraptured ponies within the audience. \n"For the last two hundred years, we have been forced to bear the weight of our civilization upon our shoulders, left without a moment of rest as we work to maintain our lives above the clouds. For the last two hundred years, the Pegasi of the Enclave have been forced to contend with terrible famine, cramped conditions, and never ending scarcity. We have worked, we have saved, and we have sacrificed. But we have never given up. We have never lowered ourselves to the base level of savagery that is now so common upon the surface. No, we have let this struggle define us."\nHis voice softens as he pauses, taking a moment to present a genuine smile to the crowd before continuing. "
 cloudsdale.28.a:0 "..."
 
 cloudsdale.29.t:0 "Tornado Continues"
 cloudsdale.29.d:0 ""We have let this struggle forge our people into something greater. More than ever before, the pegasi tribe has become a paragon of sacrifice, endurance, and integrity. With our diligence, we have built a new society for ourselves. We have given everything to ensure its survival. We've come a long way since we first shepherded the shell-shocked survivors of Cloudsdale into the Relief Camps. We've built new cities, repaired massive fleets, and grown a new culture. After all of this, we deserve something better. All of us."\n "We deserve an opportunity to love who we love, to raise a family, to stretch our wings and live free. We deserve a chance to have our own homes rather than communal apartments, to indulge somewhat on special occasions. We deserve a chance to not fear the ever present spectre of famine. We are a unique people. We have survived the end of the world with our dignity and civilization intact. As the sole arbiter of civilization left in this world, it is important that we show it. We can no longer afford to wither away among the clouds, eeking out the last bit of power present in century old machinery..."\n He surveys those present. \n "We deserve a new home. We deserve a place where we can do all of those things and more. I understand that many of those present would consider this foolish. After all, we can barely stand the strain of our population as it is. How could we ever hope to expand? Where would we go when every acre of land must be devoted to the cloud farms? I have an answer for you, my friends."\n He leans into the microphone, allowing a moment of tension to build before speaking.\n "We descend. We build a new home for ourselves among the rubble left below. It will be hard, but we have done such things before. We have succeeded before. If our people can survive the apocalypse itself, we can surely survive the scattered remnants it left behind. I cede my remaining time to the chamber."\n With a nod, Tornado steps down from the podium, returning to the tight ranks of his loyalists, disappearing behind the sturdy and scarred veterans of the Enclave's Old Guard faction. \n After a moment of silence, the chamber erupts into fierce debate."
 cloudsdale.29.a:0 "Despite his... colorful argument, Featherfall is correct. The status quo is acceptable."

 cloudsdale.30.t:0 "Duck and Cover!"
 cloudsdale.30.d:0 "We've been attacked! Our enemy came not from the Wasteland outside of our borders, nor from within our ranks, but rather from the sky above! Power armored pegasi swooped down from the clouds, dropping plasma grenades on our land below! This has led to key infrastructure being damaged. Perhaps more concerningly, this may just be a sign of what's to come."
 cloudsdale.30.a:0 "Damn them!"
 
 cloudsdale.31.t:0 "Wasteland Survey Results"
 cloudsdale.31.d:0 "Our reconnaissance unit has returned from their mission to the Surface. The information they've gathered proves what we've always known: that none of the roving bands of animals below stand a chance against the might of our military! Their factories are barely held together with duct tape, their guns are little more than welded together pipes, and their non-combatants are barely living day-to-day. Most of their governments are barely organized, with a great deal of internal conflict, and raiders occupy much of their land. How could they ever hope to compare to our might and glory? In all likelihood, they will see their lives only improve under our rule."
 cloudsdale.31.a:0 "They are weaker than expected."
 
 cloudsdale.32.t:0 "The 'Goddess'"
 cloudsdale.32.d:0 "One of the more concerning reports to come from our efforts to survey the Surface regarded a creature known only as 'The Goddess'. Not much is known about the motives of this abomination, though we do know that it is operating out of the Ministry of Arcane Science's Maripony Facility, and appears to be a result of one of their many experiments during the War. It appears to be in command of a vast army of 'alicorns', who possess considerable magical power and are fully capable of flight. These capabilities make them a particularly large threat to us, which led to them being marked as a priority target. However, Councillor Harbringer has offered an alternative to outright destroying them. \n \n Harbringer managed to obtain his position within the Council using a mix of cunning, bribery, and backroom deals. Similar tactics allowed him to survive Autumn's takeover. Now he has come to Autumn with a proposal: Rather than destroy this creature outright, we could use it to aid in Operation Cauterize. An alliance with it, he argues, would allow us to focus our forces elsewhere. After we've consolidated our control over the rest of the Surface, we could then turn on it. The rest of the Council is divided on this plan, leaving Autumn responsible for making the final decision."
 cloudsdale.32.a:0 "We do not work with monsters."
 cloudsdale.32.b:0 "He can be the one to negotiate with it then!"
 
 cloudsdale.33.t:0 "An Envoy From Above"
 cloudsdale.33.d:0 "We were interrupted this morning by a mighty cloudship descending from above. One of the pegasi, a 'Harbringer', came before Us, The Great and Powerful Goddess, with his offer: Our aid in their efforts to destroy the many petty warlords of the Wasteland. In exchange, he promised the entire Wasteland to Us! What insolence, as if We can't tell his lies! Yet, they could still be very useful. We could pit them against Our enemies, before striking them down and forcing them to join Us in Our Glorious Unity! We could also force him and those he has brought with him to join Us in Unity right now! After all, he does nothing but insult Us with his dishonesty! As if he can lie to The Goddess!"
 cloudsdale.33.a:0 "They are useful to Us. Accept their terms."

 cloudsdale.34.t:0 "An Offer Accepted"
 cloudsdale.34.d:0 "Councillor Harbringer has returned from his mission with great news. This so-called 'Goddess' has accepted our terms, and has agreed to support us during Operation Cauterize. In exchange, we will supposedly grant it all of the land on the Surface. Little does it realize, none of that land will go to it. Instead, we'll deal with that abomination right after its outlived its usefulness."
 cloudsdale.34.a:0 "Wonderful."
 
 cloudsdale.35.t:0 "Harbringer's Disaster"
 cloudsdale.35.d:0 "Harbringer's thunderhead has returned today, without the stallion himself onboard. It seems that the abomination that he defended as being a potential asset was anything but reasonable. His bodyguards and him entered Maripony, and shortly thereafter, alicorns began to attack our forces. Retaliatory strikes were conducted across their land, though a shield went up over Maripony itself shortly after our bombardments began. Harbringer and his guards are all MIA, presumed KIA. It's probably safe to say that our offer was rejected."

 cloudsdale.43.t:0 "Bad Harvest"
 cloudsdale.43.d:0 "Our recent harvests have been nothing but disastrous. Each year, our crops produce less and less food for us and our ponies. As a result, we are slowly starting to question how are we going to sustain our nation going forward. Thanks to our on-going propaganda campaign, our ponies are still loyal to our cause and our government already has laid out plans to deal with the looming famine. All we need to do now is have faith in our leaders."

 cloudsdale.47.t:0 "Enclave Offers Buyout"
 cloudsdale.47.d:0 "Early this morning, the ponies of New Neocastle were rudely awoken by the arrival of a massive Enclave cloudship. Despite their rather rude intrusion, they showed no signs of open hostility and assured us that they came with a 'deal so good, we couldn't possibly reject it.' After agreeing to meet one of their diplomats, a vertibird descended down to our agreed upon meeting area. Their negotiator defied our common perceptions of the pegasi as being elitists, and showed nothing but politefulness and respect to our Guild representatives. Greetings were quickly gotten out of the way, and negotiations proceeded smoothly. They are offering us enormous amounts of wealth and the ability to continue our work, but we'll be submitting to their rule. Their negotiator is currently awaiting our response."

Many of his most followers were placed under watch, and guards loyal to us were placed outside of his residence. Unfortunately, it seems we weren't keeping a close enough eye on him and his followers. Our guards were attacked last night by a group of Autumn supporters who had previously managed to fly under our radar. Though they were successfully subdued and detained, the former Colonel himself managed to escape during the chaos. A search is now underway, and word has been sent to the other cities to warn them of the danger he presents. Unfortunately, we fear that he's fled under the cloud layer, and out of our grasp."

We were just doing a routine scouting mission, two clicks north of Canterlot. Saw a bunch of those mutant-alicorns that seemed to be attacking some Wastelanders that had infested some wartime facility. We investigated, and got into a firefight. I made the call to plant charges to destroy whatever those muties wanted down there. When Sergeant Horrorwing and Private Flamespike went to plant charges on one of the main support beams, they flew across a vat full of green, bubbling liquid and Sergeant Horrorwing got caught in the telekinesis of one of the muties.\nThrew him right into the vat. Flamespike domed the mutie, and we retrieved Flank and got the buck out of there.§!\nThe soldier shrugged, as if that was all the information they needed.

Called an older stallion raising up above the crowd of militia and volunteers. A gleam of hope in his eyes. "We are surely doomed but we have something that they don't, something they can not take.

To safeguard those who are to take our place when we are but ash and dust but most importantly to defend our homes. This is our city, our home. These are our people, our family."

Their constant bombardment campaign has prevented any sort of stable government from rising within the former lands of Aquileia and Wingbardy, ensuring that no threat would rise against them. Meanwhile, the Holy Griffonian Empire has continued it's endless crusade against the United Socialist States of Rijekograd.

Judges are seeing a return to handle the rule of law in the Enclave.\nThis measure is a means to separate and balance powers and will contribute to the ongoing democratization of the Enclave. Seafire is hopeful that this measure will also lessen the burden placed on the higher branches of government, along with giving more civilians leeway on the matters of law."

 cloudsdale_vis.2.t:0 "The State of the Nation"
 cloudsdale_vis.2.d:0 "Standing atop the stairs of the Senate's Hall, Seafire looks out across his beloved city. Though the Council was no longer a threat, their influence remained. The ponies of New Cloudsdale remained highly militaristic and xenophobic, and much work would have to be done to correct this. It would be no easy task, but it was a task that Seafire was determined to complete. He would be the one to restore true democracy to his ponies, the one to go forth and help the Surfacers below, and the one to create a shining city in the sky. That would be his contribution to the world, and that would be his legacy to be carried on for generations."

 cloudsdale_vis.3.t:0 "Protests Erupt in the Streets"
 cloudsdale_vis.3.d:0 "Chaos has descended across New Cloudsdale, as citizens take to the streets to display their anger towards the military, and especially towards the former leader of their city, General Featherfall. The reason for this was the declassification of information regarding the Surface. All this time, the Council had insisted that the Surface was an inhospitable nightmare, full of horrifying abominations and savage barbarians. However, it has now been revealed that these claims were greatly exaggerated, and that there exists countless peaceful societies just trying to get by. \n \n This act of lying to the public for so long has sparked mass outrage, and has led to many of our ponies losing faith in both the military and the government as a whole. While this may prove a hindrance towards Seafire's plans, it has also proven to be a boon: numerous movements have formed around the idea of dedicating resources to aiding those below. This sentiment is just what we need in order to inspire reform across our society, and will provide us with all the support we need to go about establishing our presence across the Surface."
 cloudsdale_vis.3.a:0 "The truth will set us free."
 
 cloudsdale_vis.4.t:0 "Privatization of Military Assets"
 cloudsdale_vis.4.d:0 "Since our cities founding, all factories deemed essential to the military's continued operation have been owned and operated by the state. While this served to keep our army sufficiently supplied, it also disallowed any sort of private venture across various fields. As part of Seafire's efforts to liberalize our economy, a number of publicly owned production facilities will be sold off to private individuals. All that's left is to decide just how much to sell off. While privatizing more assets would benefit the economy more, it could also result in us being less prepared should any sort of armed conflict break out on the Surface."
 cloudsdale_vis.4.a:0 "Be conservative in our efforts."
 cloudsdale_vis.4.b:0 "Sell off as much as possible."
 
 cloudsdale_vis.5.t:0 "The New Cloudsdale Stock Exchange Opens"
 cloudsdale_vis.5.d:0 "As a progressive state, we need to interest our citizens in investing in the economy, as well as help promising and talented entrepreneurs. We do not need to reinvent the wheel - in the pre-war textbooks on economics, ancient ponies have long said everything for us. In Equestria, before the War, there was a stock market on which shares of businesses were bought and sold. History has shown that this was a very effective means of attracting capital to various sectors and stimulating the economy in general. Today, we opened our very own stock market, and every pegasus can visit it personally and freely invest bits in exchange for a stocks. Furthermore, we have also declared that any citizen of the Enclave, regardless of what city they hail from, may trade openly on our market. This will be a progressive and historical event for our entire economy and for our people as a whole."
 cloudsdale_vis.5.a:0 "Lets hope this wasn't a mistake."
 
 cloudsdale_vis.6.t:0 "Profits From the Stock Market"
 cloudsdale_vis.6.d:0 "It has been a great year for the traders, investors, and brokers of the New Cloudsdale Stock Exchange. The stocks are rising, rising, and rising with no end in sight. The recent invention of the New Cloudsdale Market Index, a method through which the 'health' of our stock market may be measured, has served to further common faith and trust in the idea of stocks. More ponies are trading now than before the War itself, and pegasi from all across the Enclave are coming to invest in the businesses of our great city. This has led to prosperity for both our citizens and government alike, and we look forward to our continued prosperity for years to come."
 cloudsdale_vis.6.a:0 "The stocks do nothing but rise!"
 
 cloudsdale_vis.7.t:0 "The Reapproachement Proposal"
 cloudsdale_vis.7.d:0 "For a long time, the greater Enclave has existed in a state of disunity. Each city and faction has their own ideas and their own vision for the future, leading to endless internal conflict and stalemates anytime an effort is made to make a decision affecting the Enclave as a whole. The end result of this was the Enclave existing as more of a loose confederation, with each member of this confederacy being largely left to their own devices and pursuits. \n \n Trying to unite the Enclave is, as far as Seafire is concerned, little more than a pipe dream. However, efforts can certainly be made to restore and maintain good relations with the other cities of the sky. A number of diplomats will be sent to every other city of note within the Enclave, and an effort will be made to reassure them that New Cloudsdale is a friend of all, enemy of none. It is Seafire's hope that this will contribute towards long-term positive relations, and it may also open them up to increased cooperation with our city. As a secondary goal, our diplomats will also make their best effort to try to convince the rest of the Enclave to be more open to our ideals."

 cloudsdale_vis.8.t:0 "The Universal Pardon"
 cloudsdale_vis.8.d:0 "Shockwaves have been sent across New Cloudsdale today, after Senator Seafire made a surprise speech on the steps of the Senate's Hall. The content of his speech has shocked and outraged many, as he declared a complete pardon for all 'non-criminal' dashites that have been exiled from not just New Cloudsdale, but from the Enclave as a whole. Many within our military have expressed sharp criticism of this move, and even Seafire's allies within the Senate have proven hesitant to support his declaration. Dashites have always been known as traitors to the Enclave, those who have turned their back on and betrayed their people, and this reputation won't just go away overnight. Despite this, Seafire remains optimistic that our society will come to accept these ponies as having had the best of intentions, given enough time."

 cloudsdale_vis.9.t:0 "The Return of Scoutgroup 27"
 cloudsdale_vis.9.d:0 "Scoutgroup 27 was a unit of scouts that defected from the Enclave after witnessing the conditions below. Occasional reports have been coming in for well over a decade now about their doings across the Surface, and they have grown into a bit of a myth among the military. Any and all efforts to find them have failed, and the Council eventually gave up on trying to bring them in to face justice for their desertion. \n \n Today, the infamous unit has returned to us. Even after all of these years, they are all alive and seem fully capable. Their leader, Captain Snowstorm, has expressed his appreciation for Seafire's plans, and has offered for both his unit and him to rejoin our military."
 cloudsdale_vis.9.a:0 "Welcome home."
 
 cloudsdale_vis.10.t:0 "The Memory Twins Leave Exile"
 cloudsdale_vis.10.d:0 "A pair of dashites cast out for calling for the Council to aid those below have returned to us. Prior to their exile, one of the twins was a well known industrialist, while the other was a fringe politician. It was the politician who had the courage to openly decry the Council, and call for our descent to help those below us. When she was branded a dashite, her sister was quick to come to her defence and join her in exile. They have only grown more passionate while on the Surface, and are fully willing to aid Seafire in achieving his vision for the future."
 cloudsdale_vis.10.a:0 "They could be useful."
 
 cloudsdale_vis.11.t:0 "Aid From the Sky Ponies"
 cloudsdale_vis.11.d:0 "Winged ponies descended from the heaven's above, and have offered us aid. Those ponies of the sky have done nothing for anyone down here for over two centuries now, and we are unsure if we should trust them. Though they carry with them words of good intention, they also wield weapons of such power that only a demon could be behind them. This could very well be a trap, meant to gain our trust before seizing our eternal souls. Can we really trust those strange ponies from above?"
 cloudsdale_vis.11.a:0 "They intend to help us. Accept their help!"
 cloudsdale_vis.11.b:0 "Begone, demons of the sky!"
 
 cloudsdale_vis.12.t:0 "The Festival of Plenty"
 cloudsdale_vis.12.d:0 "The tribals below have found their living standards rapidly rising with our aid. Where once there was little but small tribes and starving ragged ponies, there now exists successful workshops and happy communities. Formerly isolated tribes are now enjoying the benefits of being connected to the rest of the region, with our roads allowing for free travel and trade through the swamps. Clean water, free of the radiation and disease infesting the swamp water, has become a common commodity rather than an exotic luxury. \n \n Our generous aid has led to both of the major tribes below worshipping us as gods, giving them divine gifts from the heavens above. Though we usually wouldn't support such an ideal, Seafire has deemed this to be a prime opportunity to further our relationship with them. A major festival has been organized, based around appreciating and celebrating the friendship between our city and those tribals below. During this festival, Seafire himself will be giving a grand speech, during which he will call for the tribes to join us completely. Their plentiful land will serve to aid in both our industrial expansion, and in the creation of farmland to help deal with our food situation. And in exchange, they shall enjoy the many benefits of living under our benevolent rule."
 cloudsdale_vis.12.a:0 "We have helped you. Now, we ask that you help us."

 cloudsdale_vis.13.d:0 "Today marks the beginning of the official settlement campaign in Hayseed Swamps. Thousands of volunteers are lined up in front of our newly designated Surface Settlement Offices, hoping to acquire a settlement license for themselves. Such a license promises not only a sizable amount of land to cultivate and live upon, but also the opportunity to see the Surface, and experience things most Enclave citizens only know about from books and television."
 cloudsdale_vis.13.a:0 "The future begins today."
 
 cloudsdale_vis.14.t:0 "Full Integration of Swamp-Communities"
 cloudsdale_vis.14.d:0 "Over the past few months, thousands of pegasi have settled within Hayseed Swamp, quickly changing the demographics of every town they moved to. Where once there was only illiterate tribals, there was now thriving towns full of our pegasi. This, along with the tribals reverence of our people, has led to the swamplands rapidly becoming integrated fully within our society. As an added bonus, the various farms now dotting the swamp have been greatly successful, providing more than enough food for our people."
 cloudsdale_vis.14.a:0 "They have truly become part of our nation."
 
 cloudsdale_vis.15.t:0 "Farm Modernization Complete"
 cloudsdale_vis.15.d:0 "The name 'Hayseed Swamp' is no longer correct, as instead of the dreary wetland that filled the area around Neighvarro a few years ago, there are now farms, lush with rye, wheat, and various fruit as far as the eye can see. Forests were cleared, swamps drained, sinkholes filled up, all the while small townships sprang up all around. It is truly an idyllic sight to behold, and a testament to our achievements!"

 cloudsdale_vis.16.d:0 "Seafire's speeches have rapidly gained a reputation for causing mass outrage and shock across our entire city. However, with the widespread changes to our society, our citizens have rapidly grown far more accepting of his formerly outrageous views. Today, Seafire's speech was not met with the outcry and open booing of his speeches prior, but rather with loud cheering and stomping in response to his vision for the days ahead. The Senator has proclaimed our nation to no longer simply be the city of New Cloudsdale. Rather, we have evolved into the New Cloudsdale Republic, a true beacon of democracy and freedom across not just the sky, but the entire world. He went on to call for us to continue our efforts to bring the light of democracy to all of the Surface below, through peaceful cooperation and friendship."

 cloudsdale_vis.17.d:0 "The pegasi of New Cloudsdale have recently ended their centuries long isolation. Though this was certainly major news, we would never of suspected their plans after that, namely approaching us with a trade offer. In exchange for allowing free trade between our two nations, they have offered to open up the skies above and allow sunlight through for a designated amount of time every day. This would not only greatly benefit our traders and farmers alike, but it would also give a light of hope to our people. However, can we really trust these pegasi who have kept to themselves for so long?"

 cloudsdale_vis.19.d:0 "Trade has flourished between us and the New Cloudsdale Republic, with both of our nations prospering from it. The pegasi have already proven their intent to pursue a long-lasting friendship with us, and our interactions with them have been largely positive. However, they have now presented to us a new proposal: become an autonomous state within their nation, and enjoy all the benefits of living under their rule. While their protection and continued trade are both very valuable, we would also have to follow their laws and mandates. Our autonomy would be limited, and we would be expected to submit to their authority in many things. Should we accept such a proposal?"
 cloudsdale_vis.19.a:0 "The benefits are too many to count. Accept."

 cloudsdale_vis.20.d:0 "An interesting idea has been proposed recently. Rather than try to rule over the land that once belonged to the Leslie Raiders, we can instead grant that land to the batponies of New Mango. This would allow them to serve as a buffer state between us and any hostile nations to the west. It could also go some ways towards furthering our friendship with them."

They wish for our peoples to embrace one another with open arms, and to march forward together into a bright magical future. However, the pegasi have done very little to help the Wasteland over the last couple of centuries, and have infact done only harm with their cloud layer.

They have rejected our friendship, thrown out our ambassadors, and spat upon us with such vile unappreciation for our ideals that Seafire himself feels offended by it! If they refuse to see our light, the light of freedom and democracy, then it falls to us to bring that light to their people ourselves.

Today, the pegasi have come to us with a proposal to further our friendship. They wish to declare a free movement area between our two territories, letting our citizens travel across our borders with little hassle.

 cloudsdale_vis.27.d:0 "The 'Swampy Coast' is the part of Hayseed Swamp bordering the Mareway River. Though the region is part of the swamp, New Mareway currently occupies it and claims it to be their land. Claiming it would benefit our efforts on the Surface, and would put us in control of the entire swampland. Seafire has decided that the best way to approach this situation is to offer New Mareway a generous sum of money in exchnge for the land. The question is just how much we should offer them."

Their eyes remained fixated upon the pegasi that inhabited the city, their odd presence alone was enough to frighten the young fillies to tears. Though their presence wasn’t evidence of any innate criminality, the guards that lined the city streets monitored them with deep suspicion.\nTheir bodies were pockmarked with severely scarring. Even at a distance it was clear which wounds were caused by blades, bullets, plasma or fire. It was hard to survive in the wasteland unscathed, yet if one had to judge by appearance, then it was clear that those thestrals had experienced more horrors than most will for several lifetimes.\n\nFinally, she and her companions arrived at their destination. They were headed for a distinguished recruitment centre, which was built specifically to cater to the needs of ponies of the night.\nThe group of eight arrived at the facility and was once more given an outpouring of attention. Even amongst fellow kindred who came from far and wide, their presence elicited gasps of amazement and awe. She shook her deep-blue mane and smiled, their popularity had been as satisfying as bathing in warm water after a long day of fighting.\n\nShe was a quite popular leader, and had spent years perfecting the art of attritional warfare in the jungles.

Only seven thestrals had escaped during the assault, and no one of her kin survived. When Freudigmond came home, her mind was occupied only by rage, inspired by horrible pictures of raider credit. Retracing the trail, Freudigmond found them and made them suffer. That was her first hunt for the monsters in pony form. For ten years she and her new command have been butchering raiders and slaver companies, always attacking unexpectedly, with the jungle as her cover and friend. When she heard about 'ponies from the skies, here to defend other ponies', she immediately came to Neighvarro and offered her service to us.

Factories work overtime, pumping out the weapons and armor that the Enclave desperately requires. Every citizen does their part, working overtime and giving up their own comfort for the war.  On the surface, the great city stands united. It works as one to bring about victory. However, the reality is much less ideal.

While much of the crowd was about to be reunited with their family, just as many were there to greet a corpse. Even those who would find their loved ones alive knew that they would be injured, maimed, and possibly even disabled. \n \n The first off the cloudship were the injured, with those who could still walk leading the way. Many tears were shed, and many relieved greetings exchanged as  families found themselves reunited. Next were those who couldn't walk on their own, those too injured to even stand. Their own families greeted them with only slight hesitation, as they saw their sons and daughters in such a terrible state. Finally, came the dead. \n \n Caskets carried by soldiers, brought down to those who had been the most quiet throughout all of this. The tears being shed by these families were certainly not ones of joy, and would continue to be shed for a while. The sight was enough to bring sadness to even those who had just found their loved ones returned to them. How was this fair? So many sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters dead. For what?

We first suspected sabotage. However, inspections by our intelligence agencies did not reveal any abnormal violations and those breaches of standard labor practice that were discovered could not possibly be responsible for our industrial problems. However, as a result, our intelligence discovered an extremely strange form of protest - extremely strict fulfillment of their duties and strict observance of the rules - and this led to a significant decrease in production, since often many of our work ethic rules often contradict each other. Several large pacifist organizations also called for a boycott the products from companies which are associated with our military. The main problem is that officially our citizens do not violate any of the existing laws, however our domestic security agency continuing to monitor this situation."

That is, until one of the workers began shouting out across the factory floor. She spoke of the injustice of the war as a whole, of the pain and suffering it has brought to the ponies of New Cloudsdale, and of the many lives to have been lost to such a pointless endeavor. The factory overseers moved to silence the rebellious worker, but before they could, more began to throw down their tools and voice their agreement. The seemingly endless lists of the dead, the long unforgiving hours being forced upon them, their decreased standards of living, and much more occupied their thoughts as they gathered together as one rebellious mob. The overseers attempts to regain control of the situation failed, and the majority of workers marched out in the largest strike to ever be seen in New Cloudsdale.

What was once merely tense protests exploded into a series of violent attacks against the soldiers. This only grew exponentionally worse, as military deserters believed to be missing emerged into the city and began distributing weaponry and armor to civilians. Several officers across the city defected with all the pegasi under their command, and many more soldiers threw down their weapons and fled.\n\n Most of our city is now under the control of the rebellious citizenry, and those forces still loyal to our rightful government have retreated to critical locations and are now awaiting further orders."

 cloudsdale_purge.14.d:0 "Shocking news reached New Cloudsdale today: Army Group North has been defeated, the surviving members having abandoned their last surface-positions yesterday evening and evacuated towards New Cloudsdale.\nThis is a grave blow to the war-effort.\nNot only have many proud pegasi lost their lives, but large amounts of our equipment had to be scuttled to prevent it from falling into the hooves of the enemy.\nWith Manehattan lost, the war effort is now exclusively focused around Neighvarro, and we can only hope that our enemies in Manehattan won't use this time to prepare a counterattack, as we're stretched thin as it is..."

 cloudsdale_purge.15.d:0 "Though our brave soldiers held on for long, in the end the numerical advantage of the Wastelanders proved too much for Army Group Centre to overcome.\nThe opposition we faced there was much higher than anticipated, as our enemies seemed to almost suicidally throw themselves against our positions, and were equipped to a higher standard then predicted.\nIt seems that the industrial heart of Equestria is beating once more, and the myriad of shells and munitions it is producing come from the factories, straight into the magazines of the Wastelanders.\nThe High Council is aware that the only way to take Fillydelphia now will be through a protracted land war, that will no doubt cost thousands of brave young pegasi their lives."

 cloudsdale_purge.16.t:0 "The Taste of Victory"
 cloudsdale_purge.16.d:0 "A wirey stallion made himself presentable at Autumn's office door. Of course, he had to draw the short straw from High Command and had to inform Autumn of both the good, and the bad news. He'd never dealt with the stallion personally, but now he had to take a few deep breaths, and... Knock knock. 'Autumn, sir, Major Sparks reporting.'\n'Come in, Major. Have a seat, Wild Pegasus?' The friendly, southern voice echoed from behind his desk.\n'No thanks sir, I have news for you.' And at Autumn's direction, the stallion sat on the other side of the desk. Watching as the Commander-in-Chief adjusted some pens, and placed down a single, blank piece of paper in front of himself.\n'News for me, Major? Well by all means, go ahead.' That was all the permission the Major needed, letting forth a carefully practiced spiel exit his mouth. He spoke quickly, nervously, as if worried that he'd be stopped before he finished. 'Autumn, sir. I've just received word that the last open resistance in the Heartlands has ceased, the commanders in the area are calling up that it's over, that Cauterize is over.' A faint smile touched the commander's lips, and so did the rim of a glass as he sipped at the finest whiskey the Enclave had to offer. 'Good to hear, Major. I trust that the general populace has not been officially informed?'\n'Well, that's the problem, sir. Apparently it's gotten down the pipeline that operations have concluded. The civilians are clamouring for a lifting of wartime restrictions, and a return to standard operating procedure regarding elections.'\nAutumn paused mid-pull, tilting his head to stare at the unfortunate Major."
 cloudsdale_purge.16.a:0 "'I believe I misheard you, Major.'"
 
 cloudsdale_purge.17.t:0 "What Might the Future Hold?"
 cloudsdale_purge.17.d:0 "'Regretfully sir, you didn't.' The Major winced, fearing for his job. By the Sun and the Stars, please don't be angry.\nAutumn spoke gently, yet firmly. Speaking with the authority of a stallion who had commanded not just squads, but platoons, companies, and most importantly, entire armies. Or at least, what passes for armies in this post-war.\n'Major, let me correct you on a few facets of information. First of all, Cauterize has not finished, in fact I'd say the first phase has only just concluded. As far as we are concerned, we are still at war with those who seek to destroy our Equestria. Set up a temporary local government, and inform garrisons that this war is not over, not until every last bit of resistance is burnt from the lands.'\n'Yes sir, but, if I may...?' The Major gulped, was he asking too much?\n'Go ahead, Major.'\n'What do I inform High Command, and the civilians?'\n'The truth, Major. For the time being, we are still in a state of war, as no formal surrender has been provided. Any form of rebellion from the civilians is to be treated as such, a rebellion. You and I both know what happens to rebels and traitors.'\n'Yes sir.'\n\nAnd with that, the Major rose, saluted Autumn - who even returned the salute respectfully - and made his way out."
 cloudsdale_purge.17.a:0 "In time, we will succeed."

### Leader deascriptions###

 POLITICS_Featherfall_DESC:0 "The elderly general that has stood at the forefront of the New Cloudsdale Council for the last forty years, Featherfall has become an iconic aspect of the Enclave's political scene, if not necessarily a popular one. Having won his glory in the Griffon Campaign, he was able to reach his peak at a relatively young age, though everything since then has been mostly downhill. Generally regarded as uninspired, dry, and dismissive, many believe that Featherfall's days are numbered, both politically and on this mortal plane. \n Personality: Conservative, Dismissive, Uninspired"
 
 POLITICS_Autumn_DESC:0 "Young, fiery, and ambitious, Autumn Leaf is the face of the new revanchist movement within the Enclave, a loose coalition of radicals, militarists, and pegasi supremacists who have banded together under his flag. With the support of the influential Councilor Harbinger, Autumn has taken on a rather prominent role on the political stage, attracting many of the younger members of the military with his aggressive rhetoric and appeals to past glory. Under Autumn Leaf, the Enclave would show the world the true power of the pegasi race, at the risk of ensuring its destruction once and for all. \n Personality: Aggressive, Revolutionary, Powerful, Conceited"
 
 POLITICS_Seafire_DESC:0 "The Senate Majority Leader of the Enclave and a noted politician from New Cloudsdale, Seafire believes in a new course for the Enclave, one that would see it becoming the saviors of the Wasteland and truly representative of the system it claims to follow. A passionate and highly educated individual, he is a prominent advocate of more moderate and progressive policies, though his penchant for gallows humor has some concerned. While not necessarily an idealist, he seeks a brighter path for his ponies. \n Personality: Gallows Humor, Passionate, Well Spoken, Arrogant"
 
 POLITICS_Tornado_DESC:0 "When one seeks an Enclave war hero, they turn to General Tornado. The stallion originally proved his worth with three decades on the Enclave Covert Recon teams, retrieving vital components and resources from the wasteland to support the Enclave. Then, he personally led the team that finished the leader of the griffon menace, ensuring the safety of the Enclave for decades to come. Finally, he led the famous defense of New Cloudsburry, ensuring that the Griffons would be unable to have their final vengeance. For these actions, he lost his eye, but won a legend that would live on in the hearts of the pegasi for years to come. Now, he is a prominent advocate for a unified Enclave and a revolutionary new policy for the Surface. Regardless of what happens, Tornado will be of supreme importance in the days to come. \n Personality: Stoic, Honorable, Strong, Domineering"
