 cloudsdale.1.t:0 "The Grand Conspiracy"
 cloudsdale.1.d:0 "Unknown to even the diarch, throughout the Great War against the Zebras a plan was being set in motion. A plan conceived by one of Equestria’s core pony tribes: The Pegasi. This plan was conceived solely by Pegasi  Military, Political, and Industrial officials, and only a small handful outside of these types knew it. The plan in question was the Pegasi abandonment of Equestria, known as The Grand Conspiracy.\n The simple premise is that should Equestria lose the war against the Zebras, or if Balefire bombs reigned across the globe, The Pegasi (mainly those of military, political, industrial importance) would take to the skies and hide amongst the clouds as a fallback point, essentially leaving the rest of Equestria for dead. There at least one third of Equestria’s populous would remain unscathed, and from there they would organize and try to forge their own Equestria in the image of the Pegasi. The reason this was so secret is because this plan would essentially mean shattering the image of a united three pony tribes, which would spell serious trouble for the Pegasi governmental individuals if the diarch found out about this Conspiracy. \n This Conspiracy would eventually give birth to an all Pegasi government above the clouds that would remain in hiding for who knows how long, and the name of that government is:\nThe Enclave \n In the planning phases of that conspiracy there was division on who should lead this Pegasi government, the Political and Industrial officials who know how to keep political stability and economic prosperity, or the Military Officers who know how to keep strength and peace from within and without. In time, one of these factions came on top on who should lead the Pegasi, and that faction was... "

 cloudsdale.2.t:0 "The Fateful Day"
 cloudsdale.2.d:0 "We knew the end was coming, we knew that despite the best efforts of the diarch it would all come crumbling down. We knew that whoever wins, we lose. The first great sign was Celestia’s abdication, the next was when the Zebras lost their minds when Luna ascended to the throne, now, it was for causes unknown even to us that ignited the Balefire bombs all over the globe so long ago. In the panic that followed countless souls were lost, countless more found shelter in the Stables or other forms of shelter from the bombs, for us however, we took to the skies. It was our plan all along to take to the skies to hide from the Tartarus below, and we assumed that the Griffons or even the Dragons wouldn’t follow us because they don’t know the skies like we do, so we’re safe. One thing we lacked planning on was who or what would we save if Balefire reigned, some urged that we gather as many Pegasi as we can to save more lives and have more personal to crew our Raptors and such, while others had argued that we gather as much military equipment and technology as we can so that we would have an uncontested military advantage once the dust settled. In the heat of the moment we managed to save... "

 cloudsdale.3.t:0 "The City of New Cloudsdale"
 cloudsdale.3.d:0 "Much to the horror and dismay of the surviving Pegasi; the Pegasus Capital of the world, Cloudsdale, was one of the first cities vaporized by Zebra Balefire bombs on that fateful day. The survivors were eager to start anew, a New Cloudsdale that would be the prime jewel of The Enclave, a city that Pegasi from across the clouds of Equestria could look up to for hope, and so within the first years after the bombs fell a New Cloudsdale was built. Southward of what little is left of Cloudsdale was the site of the city of New Cloudsdale; a grand city that was as large as the old Cloudsdale and eventually grew to become the seat of government of the overall Enclave, as well as the seat of the Cloudsdale Enclave, one of several splinter factions within the Enclave that evolved over time. The city of New Cloudsdale was a monument and the pinnacle of the efforts of countless Pegasi that had dedicated themselves to rebuilding Equestria in the Enclave’s image. In the first years of New Cloudsdale’s construction it was debated on what the city itself should focus on being, an advanced military industrial complex dedicated to manufacturing the Enclave’s weapons, or a sprawling civilian metropolis with civilian industries and housing much similar to the old Cloudsdale. Eventually the bulk of New Cloudsdale was comprised of..."

Regardless of their city, wealth, or individual status, every citizen is able to cast a vote for their preferred representatives on both the High and Low councils. Many across the Enclave considers this to be one of the core aspects of their society, an aspect that allows them to claim moral and philosophical superiority over the absolutist rule of the Alicorns. Recent months have seen a surprising and worrying shift in opinion however. Several representatives have spoken out in favor of restricting the franchise, expanding the requirement of military service from the candidate to encompass the electorate as a whole. While this was initially met with outrage and outcries, the charismatic words of the fiery young Colonel Autumn have surprised many. Equally strong were the words of Senate Majority Leader, Seafire, who fiercely decried Autumn’s proposal as regressive and undemocratic. The two clashed on the Senate floor earlier today, both making strong remarks in favor of their respective stances on the issue."

It began in the infamous ‘Recovery Camps,’ the desperate refugee camps that held those Pegasi fortunate enough to escape Cloudsdale or the surface. It continued on with the First Famine, an event so terrible that it killed an estimated one fifth of the population. Today, it has resulted in the strict control of reproduction by the state, the Enclave having maintained a strict two-child policy, aside from those who have earned the privilege of additional offspring. This question has shaped modern Pegasi society, affecting general customs, perceptions, and even their approach to romantic relationships. The culture has adapted to meet the needs of the nation, generally manifesting in same-sex relationships being rewarded and tax breaks for those who choose not to have children. Despite this enormous cultural adaptation, the problem has continued to wear down the very foundation of the Enclave, the weight of the members it yearns to protect weighing it down… Recently, the issue has begun to boil over. As the strain of limited food supplies, cramped living space, and repressed sexual tension continue to bear down on the population, the pressure has become palpable. The Enclave Councils have assembled today to address this issue once more, the tightly packed room serving as yet another reminder of the ever present issue. Today, the primary clash is between General Featherfall, of the Justice and Order Party, and General Tornado, a long term advocate for unity within the Enclave. \n While many of those present expect this to be yet another repeat of the arguments made in the past, today will be somewhat more significant…"

Despite all of this, the Ponies of Enclave have been able to scrounge up the resources they need, making use of anything and everything available. Water is extracted from the clouds themselves, cloud seeding allows for a meager source of food, and the few remaining mountain peaks allowed for a source of minerals, though have long since been depleted. \nDespite these factors, life is still hard. The entirety of the Enclave’s existence revolves around the struggle to survive, a struggle that has continued since its very foundation, one born in the hunger and sickness of the recovery camps, a struggle that continued even as they rebuilt. Due to this never ending conflict against nature itself, the Enclave has a unique appreciation for the true value of solid matter. \nWhat many below might see as trash is carefully stockpiled, managed, and allotted to fit the needs of the society. From there, it is transformed to meet the needs of the society, whatever they may be. It is used to its fullest extent, long beyond what many would see as reasonable. When it finally expires, its use having been extinguished, it is not simply discarded. It is returned to the stockpiles, broken down into its base components, and recycled in any way possible.\nToday, two factions have come together to debate an issue that will transform the Enclave forever. The issue of obtaining resources from the surface. The issue that has the potential to end the great struggle, finally let the children of the sky claim the birthright they have so long been promised. To claim the birthright of their foals, to ensure that the Pegasi of the Enclave never again have to suffer under the endless scarcity of the sky. The decision made here today will steer the course of the Enclave into the future, whatever it may be."

The stallion is dressed in is iconic armor, the wear and tear on its surface showcasing a lifetime of service to his people. With a deep breath, he speaks. “We must understand the importance of our decision here, for it will define our future. I understand that there are those that propose things such as trading for the resources we require to survive. In a perfect world, we would descend to the world below, exchanging kind words with those below. Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world. The world is as we find it. You have to deal with that reality, and there are monsters in this world. There are countless numbers below that would love nothing more than to expand their reach to our havens, to kill, rape, and maim as they will. To spread their demented chaos to our cities, to tear us down to their level. And yet, you object when I refuse to kiss these monsters on the cheek and say ‘pretty please’ as we beg them for the resources we need to survive? Tell me, which of the ponies here would you put in harm's way so you wouldn’t seem like a nasty fella?” He locks eyes with Seafire, staring him down for a moment before continuing to speak. “I will not apologize for trying to keep your families safe. And I will not apologize for trying to do what needs to be done to ensure that your families can sleep safely at night. It has been my honor to be the servant of the Enclave, it has been my honor to be a servant of our people. As a General of the Enclave, it is my sworn duty to do what is right by our people, to ensure that we can survive. For the last two hundred years, we have endlessly struggled to ensure that chaos and despair never again darken our doorstep. We have failed in the past, but this struggle has made us who we are. There is only one true source of victory in this struggle, honored colleagues.” He allows a long pause, staring out at the assembled ponies."

Yet, despite this, they are little more than savages, playing in the shadow of a greater civilization. Our civilization. We have nothing but what our forefathers have left for us, nothing but the resources we have been able to gather with our own hooves. Yet despite this, we are the pinnacle of Equestrian civilization, a beacon of strength, freedom, and order across the wasteland. Now, this isn't to say that they are all savages, sadists, and barbarians. I've been to the surface before, I can tell you that there are still plenty of good ponies down there." He offers a light smile to the crowd, surprising many present with a rare show of emotion. However, the vast majority of them aren't. The vast majority aren't simply trying to carve a life for themselves in the uncaring wasteland. No, they use it to slay, oppress, and torture their fellow pony. They use it to establish a cruel dominion over those unwilling to use the very same tactics. This, above all things, justifies our right to seize what we need, nay, deserve from those that would abuse it. The resources below could end our struggle, not in the ever present threat of defeat, but in the golden light of victory. We could win a final victory, end the constant state of scarcity that has haunted our people. All we need to do is understand that it is ours for the taking. That it belongs to you.

Turning to the assembled representatives, he waits for them to quiet down before beginning to speak, his voice was smooth and calm despite his previous misgivings.\n“Hello again friends. I have to say, I am rather impressed by the passion of General Tornado’s proposal, if not its contents. As, while he has the right idea, he’s approaching it in the wrong way. The way that would see us descend to their level, making use of violence to enforce our will upon those less fortunate than ourselves. Haven’t we learned better than that? This isn’t to say that the resource issue isn’t the core of our societies woes: I think we’re all smart enough to see the truth in that regard, so I don’t feel a pressing need to say what has already been said. I and those aligned with me believe that what General Tornado here is morally wrong, though we don’t necessarily disagree with his argument as a whole. We do live in an imperfect world.”\nHe grins at the crowd for a moment. \n“We wouldn’t be stuck up here if it was perfect! But, as he said, we don’t live in a perfect world. He came to the conclusion that, as a result of this imperfection, we need to make use of force to take what we need. I see it a different way. I see it as yet another example of the world urging us to aspire to perfection, to seek to be better than we are. We have in our hooves immense power to do both good and evil, power that we have refrained from using due to fear of the unknown. I would not suggest that we greet the unknown with open hooves, for that would be foolish. Instead, I suggest that we offer a hoof in greeting.

We experience sunlight every day up here, it’s a normal part of life. Down there? They live in our shadow. They dream of the sun, of the warmth it brings on a cool spring day. What about water? That’s one of the things we’ve always had more than enough, isn’t it? Did you know that ponies down below die of thirst of all things? Can’t we make it literally fall from the sky? On that topic, what about storms? They’re a bit of thunder to us, but nothing serious. To them, it’s a terrifying onslaught from the sky, pounding down upon their measly little homes. We control each of these things, don’t we? So why not use them? We don’t need to give up our resources to get what we need, we merely need to barter with the sky itself. We need some food to shore up the emergency rations? Let’s offer a settlement three months of sunlight in exchange for that. What about that replacement part for the Raptor? That’ll be a season of rain, just for you! Some more medical supplies? The next group of raiders that comes for your little settlement surely won’t enjoy being struck by lightning, no?” He chuckles, bringing a hoof down on the cloud. “We live upon the greatest economic potential in the wasteland! Let’s use it! We can maintain our dignity, maintain our way of life, all while enhancing it with goods from the surface. Even better, we can do it with a clean conscious, all while staying true to our valued principles! Tornado means well, but his method is crude and unnecessarily violent. By simply making use of our monopoly over weather, we can achieve so much more at a nearly negligible cost. Who wouldn’t want that?”\nHe gives the crowd his best smile, holding it awkwardly as the seconds tick on.

Today, however, this changed. For the first time in history, the senate has been called together to discuss this issue at the behest of none other than Majority Leader Seafire, the most prominent progressive reformist in New Cloudsdale. While many have grumbled about the session, even more have attended, drawn forth by distaste, association, or curiosity.\n---\nWith the majority of the Senate gathered, Seafire has emerged from his cluster of allies and proteges, ready to present his case in favor of the Wastelanders. The murmured conversation comes to a halt as he arrives at the podium, taking up a position behind and offering his trademark smile to the assembled Pegasi. \n“Hello again friends! I’m glad so many of you could make it here today, given the short notice. With how many of you are packed in here, I assume that you’re already familiar with the topic of today: Wastelanders. Now, this is always something that we’ve been hesitant to talk about. I mean, unless you’re Colonel Autumn or one of his cronies, but that’s a side note. In all seriousness, I think it’s very important that we discuss this now rather than later, given everything that’s happening. With all the changes going on now, we may have to have a solid policy towards the surface much sooner than we first thought, which is really a terrifying thought. I mean, these are ponies that we haven’t really interacted with properly in two centuries. And when it comes down to it, that’s the core of this. They’re ponies, not wastelanders.”"

Nothing unexpected, so he continued on.\n“And yes, I mean what I said. We treat them like they’re some different species, that they are intrinsically different than us. Admittedly, there are a number of cultural differences, but that doesn’t change the simple fact that at our core, we are all still ponies. The main thing that sets us apart on a biological level is the fact that we have a pair of wings and less radiation. Beyond that, we’re pretty much the same. Now, on an actual personal level, that’s where we run into issues. It’s a simple fact that we are, on average, healthier, stronger, better educated, more disciplined, and more civilized than the vast majority of ponies on the surface. This is something that can’t be ignored as it places a natural barrier between us. But we also can’t ignore that they are ponies, just like you and me. We can’t ignore that over a thousand years ago, we were faced with a similar situation. And once again, we can’t ignore that the pony tribes only achieved true prosperity by working past their differences and acknowledging one another as equal in nature, if not in ability.”\nThe room is silent as his dialogue becomes increasingly radical, though some appear to be intrigued by his words.\n“I believe that if we approach these ponies as inherently equal, we can forge a better world for our foals. Of course, we must maintain a degree of separation, our cultural differences would make full integration impossible, but we should certainly take steps to bridge that gap. To acknowledge that we aren’t inherently superior due to the wings on our backs. That maybe, just maybe, they are worthy of some compassion as well.”\n---\nHe concludes, preparing to stop, before reconsidering. "

What does that punishment actually mean?” As he continued on, he drew increasingly incredulous stares from the audience, his proteges gaping in surprise at the unplanned tangent. “Yes, I understand that it means banishment, but why do we practice it? Why do we honor some mare that abandoned us two hundred years ago by ensuring that she is remembered by those that would happily follow in her footsteps? And most of all, why do we punish those whose only crime is compassion with something like that? Now, I’m not saying that traitors like Deadshot Calamity should be forgiven, they committed actual crimes after all. No, what I don’t get is why ponies like Radar are punished for being willing to perform a simple act of kindness. That’s what got his banished after all, isn’t it? Dropping medical supplies to a dying mare? Who wouldn’t do that?” The shock has started to fade, with some staring in anger, others in consideration, while that vast majority sit in an awkward sort of silence. “What I mean is this: the term Dashite only serves as another way to separate us from ponies on the surface. To remember how a mare betrayed our entire civilization two hundred years ago. Let’s forget her. Let’s forget the brand. Let’s forget this concept as a whole! Empathy shouldn’t be punished, it’s only natural that you feel for your fellow ponies! If somepony commits a crime serious enough to warrant a greater punishment, just dust them! Don’t make them a martyr and release them into the wild, that only makes them more dangerous. What I’d suggest is a… reconciliation of sorts with that that were cast out preemptively. That way, we can start healing this wound that ancient betrayal left.”\n---\nThe crowd is silent, many still processing what was just said.

This rapidly led to anti-Equestrian sentiments, and would eventually result in the skies being sealed off.\nDue to such, it has always been a firm policy of the Enclave to not engage in any sort of conscription. Only those who were fully willing would serve their country. At one time, this led to a very loyal and almost ideologically fanatic military. However, the various benefits and moderate pay offered to soldiers and veterans alike has led to a massive influx of recruits over recent years. While some may consider a large army to be desirable, others have begun to voice their concerns regarding this situation. \nMany of those within the political sphere are worried about the drain on resources a larger military would present, as well as this taking potential workers away from various civilian industries. Meanwhile, some within the military itself are concerned about this affecting the quality of the military as a whole. After all, a larger army is not necessarily a better one.\nThe issue has become such a matter of debate that the High Council has been forced to make a decision regarding it. They could carry on as is, allowing recruits to flood in. Alternatively, they could set a limit on yearly recruitment. This would solve the situation, but it would also result in a lower pool of ponypower to draw from, in the event of any conflict breaking out."

For the last two hundred years, we have placed our trust with those that have the experience and discipline of military service to lead us, allowing them to guide our path through history! For the last two hundred years, they have done so with a level of skill, honor, and strength found nowhere else within history. Their sage guidance has allowed us to move forward from the Recovery Camps of old, it allowed us to emerge from the tainted dust of the old world unscathed. For two hundred years, we have trusted them to guide us into the future, a trust that they have proven and reciprocated ten times over. As it stands, we are on the brink of a new era for our people, one that will define how we are remembered by history. We can not afford to falter at this most delicate point, to weaken ourselves by accepting the opinion of those that lack the honor of service on an equal level. We require military service for a reason: it serves as the ultimate test of character. Without this protection, our democracy would have failed long ago, swept aside by the taint of radical populism that Seafire so eagerly endorses. What I propose today would expand the requirements we place upon the candidates to the base of the system itself, allowing us to raise the electorate the meet the quality of those that they choose to govern.

We meet here today in the halls of New Cloudsdale, the capital of our people. It wasn’t always our capital though. Two hundred years ago, that right was reserved for the first Cloudsdale, the greatest city our people ever knew. Within those vaunted halls, some of the greatests dramas of history played out. Commander Hurricane led the conquest of the Pegasi tribes, forging us into a united people. Flash Magnus ensured the continuation of that unity in the uncertain times of the War against the Nightmare. Commander Ironhead led his legendary defense against the dragon menace, driving them back from the ancient bastion at the center of the city. Despite all of this history, the city was destroyed in a single stroke. It wasn’t our fault though. No…”\n He offers a grim smile to the silent crowd, allowing the tension to draw out as the seconds continued on..\n“No, it wasn’t our fault my friends. We had merely done our duty, done what was expected of us. We did not decide to start the war with the Zebras! We did not choose to plunge our nation into battle after a hundred decades of undisturbed peace! We did not choose the develop the weapons that would end our world! No… that was the choice of the Alicorns. As a result of their arrogance, their zealotry, and their absolute rule, they plunged our nation into a war that would destroy the world. What Autumn is calling for today? It would do the same. He proposes stripping the power away from the ponies, placing it solely in the hands of a singular organization, an organization that holds loyalty to him alone. Not only would he cast aside our most treasured tradition of democracy for this unseemly ambition, he would do so with the intent of permanently eradicating the franchise to secure his grip.”\n“The issue before us today is not one of simple politics. It is one of survival. Not for our people, as Autumn so brazenly suggests, but for our culture and the very beliefs it is based upon. Autumn would have us cast that aside, embracing the authoritarianism that destroyed our world in the past. It is our job, our duty to deny those that would destroy what we hold most dear. Our democracy must be not only the envy of the wasteland but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with the Enclave that cannot be cured by what is right with Enclave. I rest my case and urge my colleagues here to make the right decision.”"

 cloudsdale.27.t:0 "Featherfalls Speech"
 cloudsdale.27.d:0 "General Featherfall begins, slowly making his way over the central podium, his back left leg dragging behind him, an injury obtained during the Griffon Incursion. He surveys the crowd for several seconds, taking a sip from the glass of water positioned on the podium by an aid before beginning to speak, his voice dry and dismissive. \n“The issue that has come before the council today is one that has been repeated by a hundred different ponies a hundred different times. I’ve lived through countless movements just like this one. I’ve lived to see them fade, as their champions realize the foolishness of their proposals and quietly withdraw from the political scene, doing their best to hide their shame. The only truly surprising aspect of this iteration of the argument is the stallion making it: I truly expected better from General Tornado. Though I suppose heroism doesn’t necessarily bring wisdom. I’ll make this fast and simple, my colleagues.”He drags his tired gaze across the ponies assembled, allowing them to clearly see his disdain for the topic at hand. “Let’s break down the reasons presented. I admit, some of the concerns are legitimate, but others are just… decadent. In regards to the stretched food supplies, I will point to historical precedent. Things have always been difficult, though we have always prevailed. The last actual famine was forty years ago, lasting only a few short months before our rationing was able to address it once more. That’s a simple fact of life here in the sky, one that won’t change regardless of our feelings in that regard. Toughen up and understand the reality of the situation, ponies. As for living space? Please. We live in the greatest conditions left in the world, conditions more luxurious than those on the ground could even dream of. Stop letting your greed dictate your actions. It is not befitting of you. Finally… I hesitate to even address this point, though I feel I must given the emphasis you have placed upon it.” He allows a long pause, directing an accusatory gaze towards the ponies in the audience. “The fact that you see… sexual satisfaction as a serious issue speaks poorly of you. Is the younger generation so promiscuous and hedonistic that they can think of nothing other than the… bonking on a cloud speaks poorly of your generation. That this is an issue shows the blatant irresponsibility of those assembled, the sheer inability to control their… base impulses! Shame on you all!” \nHe waves his hoof at the now utterly silent Council, trudging back towards the bench, ignoring their stunned stares as he hefts himself onto the cloudy seat, grunting with effort as he adjusts his leg."

 cloudsdale.28.t:0 "Tornado's Speech"
 cloudsdale.28.d:0 "In the midst of the silence, Tornado stood, instantly drawing attention to him with his sudden movement. He took the time to survey the crowd, his glowing prosthetic eye an imposing sight to the younger representatives present. Finally, he began to make his way down to the podium, his gait still steady despite his advanced age, a result of the advanced training regimine he still practiced to this day. \nWhen he finally reached the podium, he stood in silence for several moments before speaking, his traditional Enclave dress uniform still pristine, despite its obvious age, the gleaming medals that lined his chest only adding to its luster. With an abrupt nod, he begins to speak, his powerful voice commanding attention from all those present. \n“Twelve years ago, our people suffered as our ancestors did as famine once more laid low our great city. Twelve years ago, an estimated ten thousand ponies died of starvation. This problem has always plagued our people and so long as we sit here and refuse to address it, it shall continue to do so. General Featherfall proposes that we do just that: sit here and wait for yet another famine to strike our city, sunder our home, and wither our people. We can and must prevent the tragedy of famine in the future instead of merely trying to salvage the equine wreckage of the famine with pious regret and empty promises. How much longer will we have to wait until someone is willing to take decisive action to address this most pressing issue? How long must we wait until the Council does what needs to be done?”\nHis voice rises in both volume and tempo as he speaks, his eyes locked with the enraptured ponies within the audience. \n“For the last two hundred years, we have been forced to bear the weight of our civilization upon our shoulders, left without a moment of rest as we work to maintain our lives above the clouds. For the last two hundred years, the Pegasi of the Enclave have been forced to contend with terrible famine, cramped conditions, and never ending scarcity. We have worked, we have saved, and we have sacrificed. But we have never given up. We have never lowered ourselves to the base level of savagery that is now so common upon the surface. No, we have let this struggle define us.”\nHis voice softens as he pauses, taking a moment to present a genuine smile to the crowd before continuing. "

 cloudsdale.29.t:0 "Tornado continues"
 cloudsdale.29.d:0 "“We have let this struggle forge our people into something greater. More than ever before, the Pegasi tribe has become a paragon of sacrifice, endurance, and integrity. With our diligence, we have built a new society for ourselves. We have given everything to ensure its survival. We’ve come a long way since we first shepherded the shell-shocked survivors of Cloudsdale into the Relief Camps. We’ve built new cities, repaired massive fleets, and grown a new culture. After all of this, we deserve something better. All of us.”\n “We deserve an opportunity to love who we love, to raise a family, to stretch our wings and live free. We deserve a chance to have our own homes rather than communal apartments, to indulge somewhat on special occasions. We deserve a chance to not fear the ever present spectre of famine. We are a unique people. We have survived the end of the world with our dignity and civilization intact. As the sole arbiter of civilization left in this world, it is important that we show it. We can no longer afford to wither away among the clouds, eeking out the last bit of power present in century old machinery…”\n He surveys those present. \n “We deserve a new home. We deserve a place where we can do all of those things and more. I understand that many of those present would consider this foolish. After all, we can barely stand the strain of our population as it is. How could we ever hope to expand? Where would we go when every acre of land must be devoted to the cloud farms? I have an answer for you, my friends.”\n He leans into the microphone, allowing a moment of tension to build before speaking.\n “We descend. We build a new home for ourselves among the rubble left below. It will be hard, but we have done such things before. We have succeeded before. If our people can survive the apocalypse itself, we can surely survive the scattered remnants it left behind. I cede my remaining time to the chamber.”\n With a nod, Tornado steps down from the podium, returning to the tight ranks of his loyalists, disappearing behind the sturdy and scarred veterans of the Enclave’s Old Guard faction. \n After a moment of silence, the chamber erupts into fierce debate."

She rules over one of the newfound groups of mutants that are apparently alicorns much similar to the diarch of the old world. The alicorns of The Goddess’s alicorns mostly live in the old Ministry of Arcane Sciences hub known as Maripony, though some groups have been known to go around the wasteland reeking havoc to some communities, in most cases acting like a hive mind. While these alicorns are winged creatures the fact that they are solely created from the backfiring of a pre war genetics project and are a hive mind lead by the melted remains of some magician and supposedly Twilight Sparkel, it is clear that they pose great strength and could be a incredibly useful asset to us and can fly along side us.

Their massive, warships of the sky loom over our cities and settlements, casting the land into darkness. Flocks of Vertibucks sore and cut across our sky, their troops swoop down to the surface. Their black and grey legion of metal, marching towards our doorstep, lead by a Pegasus of brown. Clad with a green suit of armor and a red glare of wickedness in his eyes. “They outnumber us…. Were dead.” Cried a young pony, shaking at the wall with fear and horror glued to his face. “Yes. Yes they do. The Enclave outnumber us ten to one, they wield weapons and tech superior to our meek wasteland rifles and have dominion over the sky.” Called an older stallion raising up above the crowd of militia and volunteers. A gleam of hope in his eyes. “We are surely doomed but we have something that they don’t, something they can not take. A reason to stand and fight.” He turned to the militia and police forces. “To protect the innocent and defend the weak, to fulfill our duty,” He stated turning his gaze to his fellow ponies, “To save the ones we love, our friends and our families. To safeguard those who are to take our place when we are but ash and dust but most importantly to defend our homes. This is our city, our home. These are our people, our family.” He shouted to the crowd with a raised hoof. The pony took the first shot, turning around and acting before all others as he fired his old, worn hunting rifle down on the coming hordes. Scaring their leaders cheek before being violently gunned down by swarms of green plasma. It was time to decide, to fight or to die?"

For the whole time the wasteland had not been a cesspool of raiders and cannibalism, but rather a collection of poor societies trying to make do with the hellscape that is the wasteland. What really ignited the protests was that the whole time the Enclave government has done nothing to help the world below the clouds and lying to the citizens that the wasteland is too dangerous to be worth the effort.\nThe citizens of the Enclave live much better lives than the despair that the folks of the wasteland live in, and the lack of aid from the council has rallied the citizens to demand said government to do something about it. Signs demanding action to help the wasteland was the usual foray of the protests but there were others who demanded violence against the council and especially Featherfall. The police and military are desperately trying to contain the situation, but it’s only a matter of time until the protesters turn violent and attempt to lay waste to the government.

Having won his glory in the Griffon Campaign, he was able to reach his peak at a relatively young age, though everything since then has been mostly downhill. Generally regarded as uninspired, dry, and dismissive, many believe that Featherfall's days are numbered, both politically and on this mortal plane. \n Personality: Conservative, Dismissive, Uninspired"

With the support of the influential Councilor Harbinger, Autumn has taken on a rather prominent role on the political stage, attracting many of the younger members of the military with his aggressive rhetoric and appeals to past glory. Under Autumn Leaf, the Enclave would show the world the true power of the Pegasi race, at the risk of ensuring its destruction once and for all. \n Personality: Aggressive, Revolutionary, Powerful, Conceited"

A passionate and highly educated individual, he is a prominent advocate of more moderate and progressive policies, though his penchant for gallows humor has some concerned. While not necessarily an idealist, he seeks a brighter path for his ponies. \n Personality: Gallows Humor, Passionate, Well Spoken, Arrogant"

Finally, he led the famous defense of New Cloudsburry, ensuring that the Griffons would be unable to have their final vengeance. For these actions, he lost his eye, but won a legend that would live on in the hearts of the Pegasi for years to come. Now, he is a prominent advocate for a unified Enclave and a revolutionary new policy for the surface. Regardless of what happens, Tornado will be of supreme importance in the days to come. \n Personality: Stoic, Honorable, Strong, Domineering"
