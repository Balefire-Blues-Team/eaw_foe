 cloudsdale.1.t:0 "The Grand Conspiracy"
 cloudsdale.1.d:0 "Unknown to even the diarch, throughout the Great War against the Zebras a plan was being set in motion. A plan conceived by one of Equestria’s core pony tribes: The Pegasi. This plan was conceived solely by Pegasi  Military, Political, and Industrial officials, and only a small handful outside of these types knew it. The plan in question was the Pegasi abandonment of Equestria, known as The Grand Conspiracy.\n The simple premise is that should Equestria lose the war against the Zebras, or if Balefire bombs reigned across the globe, The Pegasi (mainly those of military, political, industrial importance) would take to the skies and hide amongst the clouds as a fallback point, essentially leaving the rest of Equestria for dead. There at least one third of Equestria’s populous would remain unscathed, and from there they would organize and try to forge their own Equestria in the image of the Pegasi. The reason this was so secret is because this plan would essentially mean shattering the image of a united three pony tribes, which would spell serious trouble for the Pegasi governmental individuals if the diarch found out about this Conspiracy. \n This Conspiracy would eventually give birth to an all Pegasi government above the clouds that would remain in hiding for who knows how long, and the name of that government is:\nThe Enclave \n In the planning phases of that conspiracy there was division on who should lead this Pegasi government, the Political and Industrial officials who know how to keep political stability and economic prosperity, or the Military Officers who know how to keep strength and peace from within and without. In time, one of these factions came on top on who should lead the Pegasi, and that faction was... "
