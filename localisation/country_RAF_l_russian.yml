 RAF_opening_1:0 "Power of Friendship"
 RAF_opening_1_desc:0 "We have heard much of this so-called 'friendship', a force that could make or break nations. Should we give it a chance, allow it into our hearts and shells? Or do we reject it, confident in the might of our claws and our claws alone?"
 
 RAF_opening_2:0 "Pacifism or Militarism?"
 RAF_opening_2_desc:0 "Nocrab can deny the brutality of the above-water world we find ourselves in. It's a crab-eat-crab Wasteland, sometimes literally thanks to crabibals.

 RAF_opening_3:0 "§ALord Crabby's Ascension§!"

 RAF_crab_industry_3:0 "Put the Peasants to work"

 RAF_crab_industry_4:0 "A new Water purification-Plant"
 RAF_crab_industry_4_desc:0 "Crikey! One has to wonder how we can live without water! The great priority of our nation’s industrial effort should now be focused squarely on getting the right water or we are all gonna get right cooked under this sweltering heat. Reckon that’s gotta be important."
 
 RAF_crab_industry_5:0 "Azureway-Dockyards"
 RAF_crab_industry_5_desc:0 "Come to the Azureway Dockyards! This week we have a beautiful range of ship, boats, and canoes of all kinds all just here for us to get it!

 RAF_crab_industry_7:0 "Ghost Crab Manufacturies"
 RAF_crab_industry_7_desc:0 "Our Ghost Crabs have well and truly gone above and beyond by proving themselves.

 RAF_crab_industry_9:0 "Open the Borders"
 RAF_crab_industry_9_desc:0 "Think we gonna stop the boats? Of course not! That would dumb, ya see, our nation is a nation of immigrants and we thrive on diversity! Especially more so when they don’t half mind settling down and picking up a gun to fight for our little Crabbies to come out on top! We would be led by a right loon, otherwise, if we don’t get some of them Johnny Foreigners here to help our cause."
 
 RAF_crab_industry_11:0 "The Crabdustrial Revolution"

 RAF_crab_army_1:0 "Train the Warriors"

 RAF_crab_army_2:0 "From Rivers to Oceans"

 RAF_crab_army_13:0 "Rapidfire Harpoons"
 RAF_crab_army_13_desc:0 "What better way to crack another hardshell than from a distance. Rather than crabbing a few harpoons and chucking them, our crabative geniuses back home have invented weapons that can fire these shellcrackers."
 
 RAF_crab_army_14:0 "§YA Perfect Shellfish Army§!"
 RAF_crab_army_14_desc:0 "With every crustacean now having a role in the grand army of crabstria. We can now focus on improving the quality of every shellfish. From hermits to soldiers.

 RAF_crab_poli_1:0 "Exile Dissidents"
 RAF_crab_poli_1_desc:0 "Not everycrab agrees with the wisdom of Lord Crabby. This won't do at all. If everycrab is not willing to do their part, our nation will fall into disarray.

 RAF_crab_poli_2:0 "§RProclaim Crab-Destiny§!"
 RAF_crab_poli_2_desc:0 "Many of our wisest philosocrabs have begun speaking of an idea they refer to as Crab-Destiny. It is the idea that the entire world belongs to Lord Crabby and us crabs, and it is our destiny to conquer it. This provides a perfect justification for our conquests to come."

 RAF_crab_poli_5:0 "Enshrine Absolutism"
 RAF_crab_poli_5_desc:0 "There is only enough room for one crab within a shell. The corruption that runs rampant within our government shall be defeated by centralizing all power within Lord Crabby, for he is incorruptable."

 RAF_crab_poli_lord2:0 "The Southern Azureway"
 RAF_crab_poli_lord2_desc:0 "The Azureway runs south, through the lands of rock. rocks are not like shells, for they are hard at their core and can't be used for protection.

 RAF_crab_poli_lord3:0 "The Eastern Crabpitalists"
 RAF_crab_poli_lord3_desc:0 "Crabpitalism. That most dreaded concept, which allows some crabs to get rich off of others. Though it has a place within society, it becomes dangerous when taken to the extreme.

Unfortunately, we can't offer them that. However, we can offer them slightly warmer lands to the south, where they may seek some warmth."
 
 RAF_crab_poli_lord7:0 "Free the Plainscrab's Homeland"
 RAF_crab_poli_lord7_desc:0 "Plainscrab's are a common sight within our nation, crabfugees who fled from warlords to the north. They have been kept away from their homeland for long enough. The time is now for our claws to reclaim that which rightfully belongs to our brothers!"

 RAF_crab_poli_lord12:0 "§RLord Crabby's In Control§!"
 RAF_crab_poli_lord12_desc:0 "There is only one crab in this shell, and that is Lord Crabby. All others are nothing more than an extension of his will, a way for his claws to take action for the benefit of us all. Praise be Lord Crabby!"

 RAF_crab_poli_lord18: "The Mouth of the Azureway"
 RAF_crab_poli_lord18_desc:0 "The land of New Mareway reminds us of ourselves, with their aristocrabacy and feudal society. Unfortunately for them, they stand between us and the glorious ocean beyond. Our claws shall strike them softly, but strike them they must."
 
 RAF_crab_poli_lord20:0 "Masters of Land and Water"
 RAF_crab_poli_lord20_desc:0 "Lord Crabby has ascended beyond even Poseidon Himself, for his domain is not just the sea, but the land as well! All that exists within this world belongs to Lord Crabby, and through him it belongs to us, the common crab."
 
 RAF_crab_poli_lord19:0 "Liberate the Cozy Swamps"
 RAF_crab_poli_lord19_desc:0 "The southern swamps are homes to all sorts of things. Odd tree-worshippers, flying horses, and fruit-obsessed bats just to name a few.

 RAF_crab_poli_lord23:0 "Sunny Shores Ahead!"
 RAF_crab_poli_lord23_desc:0 "Lord Crabby grows tired of these dreary skies. Fortunately, he has heard of a shore that still enjoys the light of the sun. Onwards, to Sunny Shore!"
