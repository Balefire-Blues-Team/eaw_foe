 vermillionists.1.t:0 "The Revolution has begun!"
 vermillionists.1.d:0 "WIP\ntalks about the people of Kucyków being up in arms, and any perceived 'Class traitor' being dragged into the streets and beaten to death. Then tells you that the Assembly of Hearts have re-structured the parties, and Lord Vermillion Grace has taken temporary leadership of the new Government."
 vermillionists.1.a:0 ""
 
 vermillionists.2.t:0 "An offer from the Vermillionists"
 vermillionists.2.d:0 "A small delegation from the Revolutionaries in the Commonwealth arrived in our great city today, bearing a document that they wish us to sign.\nThe Document beseeches us to support these 'Fellow Comrades in the fight for Liberty', as Lord Vermillion Grace describes his people, in their war against the Royalists on our eastern border.\n\nIn exchange for such support, the new Government in Kucyków has offered to recognize our claims to the lands surrounding Stratusburg, and would lend us assistance in the eventual war to reclaim the errant Cloud-City.\n\nWe should be cautious to believe their claims of future support, but this might be a great opportunity to make a very powerful ally.\n\nOf course, there is always the Risk that the Vermillionists loose the civil war, and we'd be caught alone against the Royalists, but that should be a neglible concern.\nWe need to decide now, and swiftly mobilize, should we opt for intervention..."
 vermillionists.2.a:0 "We accept."
 vermillionists.2.b:0 "Deny their request"
 
 vermillionists.3.t:0 "Novochernusk accepted our Proposal"
 vermillionists.3.d:0 "Our allies in Novochernusk have accepted our proposal to join on ous side in the Civil-war.\nThe treaty stipulates that they hand over any Commonwealth land they seize in the conflict, and also promises them our aid against Stratusburg, whenever they should go to war with them.\nThis will surely quicken the Civil-war and secure our Victory over the Royalists."
 vermillionists.3.a:0 "The Revolution marches on."
 
 vermillionists.4.t:0 "Novochernusk Mobilizes for Intervention"
 vermillionists.4.d:0 "Those shady Republicans and Lunarists in Novochernusk have recently started to mobilize their army to their eastern Border, no doubt wit the intention of intervening in the ongoing Civil-war in the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Dictatorius and his council have decided that such an action cannot stand unanswered, and given orders for general mobilization as well.\nWe will send a missive to Stalwart Shield, leader of the Royalist faction, and align ourselves with her, under the condition that the entirety of Chovochernusk goes to us after the war.\nThis will no doubt draw the Revolutionaries into the war against us, so the Dictatorius has ordered a preemtive strike against them as well.\n\nSoon, Stratusburg will show the world its strength!"
 vermillionists.4.a:0 "Mobilize!"
 vermillionists.4.b:0 "Maybe we should beack down?"
 
 vermillionists.5.t:0 "Stratusburg mobilizes"
 vermillionists.5.d:0 "Our intelligence network has been in upraor for the past few days, as reports of both Novochernusk, and then Stratusburg mobilizing trickled in.\nToday, we finally have confirmation of what is going on:\nNovochernusk seems to have sided with the damned Vermillionists, and is preparing to invade our lands from the west.\nNot wanting to see their rival gain any power, Stratusburg has now mobilized as well, preparing for a war against Novochernusk and the Vermillionists.\n\nA short message from their Dictatorius informed us that Stratusburg intends to act as a loose ally of ours in the fight against the vile rebels. In exchange for their help, they request that we do not interfere with their occupation of Novochernusk, and hand over any territory we aquire from them. They will likewise hand over any Commonwealth-territory back to us, once the war has concluded.\nWhile Stratusburg itself is a traitorous province of the Commonwealth, we don't really have a choice but to accept their offer.\nWe can always betray them at a later point..."
 vermillionists.5.a:0 "Their time will come..."
