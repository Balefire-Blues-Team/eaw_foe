Slave./"/n/nStrong, both of will and of body, with a crimson coat and a jet black mane, §YRed Eye§! is an earth pony stallion hated by those who don't follow his ideals. Scattered across his flanks are scars, evidence of the cutie marks he obliterated, the icons that once laid there long forgotten by all but himself. Red Eye's right eye is where he got his name, cybernetic enhancements from his life in Stable 101, where earth ponies continued the advances of science and technology, for personal gain. This didn't sit well with Red Eye, who slaughtered those who disagreed with his twisted idea of mutual responsibility, and mutual rewards for mutual work, and off he went. The barding of his stable around his neck as a reminder of what happens when anyone puts themselves above all others.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
