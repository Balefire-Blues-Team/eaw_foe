Slave./"\n\nStrong, both of will and of body, with a crimson coat and a jet black mane, §YRed Eye§! is an earth pony stallion hated by those who don't follow his ideals. Scattered across his flanks are scars, evidence of the cutie marks he obliterated, the icons that once laid there long forgotten by all but himself. Red Eye's right eye is where he got his name, cybernetic enhancements from his life in Stable 101, where earth ponies continued the advances of science and technology, for personal gain. This didn't sit well with Red Eye, who slaughtered those who disagreed with his twisted idea of mutual responsibility, and mutual rewards for mutual work, and off he went. The barding of his stable around his neck as a reminder of what happens when anyone puts themselves above all others.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

 lit_shakespar: "§ATalented Poet§!"
 lit_shakespar_desc: "Born to an unassuming family of scavengers living within the Thunderous Fields to the north, Shakespar has been a part of the Lightning Scavnegers for his entire life. His entry into politics wouldn't come until later on in his life, following his career in the late Thunderous Warband and their defeat in the Thunder-War. With the humiliating defeat within the public conscious, Shakespar would rise to power on promises of reform and centralization. Ironically, he would go on to become commonly viewed as a representative of the status-quo and conservative values.\n\n He enjoys a great deal of support from the majority of the Assembly, especially from the elders of the various tribes around the region, which his hooves-off policies have made him popular among. These same policies have also been a constant source of criticism levied against his leadership, with his opposition decrying his reign as ineffective. The rise of radicalism across the nation seems to prove their point, though only time will tell if Shakespar can continue to guide his country into the future."
 lit_skybreaker: "§pHopeful Magocrat§!"
 lit_skybreaker_desc: "Skybreaker of Lightning Point. An unassuming stallion of short stature with an equally unassuming upbringing, few could of predicted Skybreaker's rise to power. His own hometown expected him to follow in his parents hoofsteps, tending to the family farm and selling what little excess produce they could grow to get by. He would defy these expectations by insteading pursuing the field of technoarcane repair, first as a hobby and later as a career. He would quickly become widely popular within his settlement for establishing small-scale generators across the town, getting a series of automated turrets operational to defend the town, and introducing many of the local businesses to the useful nature of terminals.\n\n These accomplishments would cement him as a pillar of the community and would ultimately lead to him taking the position of mayor after the death of his precessor. Since then, the engineer-turned-politician has spent most of his time preaching about the wonders of both magic and technology across the nation. As his popularity as grown, so too has his ambition."
 lit_swiftstorm: "§cPegasus Nationalist§!"
 lit_swiftstorm_desc: "Swift Storm's ancestors were once very prominent members of the Cloudsdale survivors, being directly involved in the formation of the Assembly along with the foundation of many of the settlements across the Lightning Scavenger's territory. In a twist of irony, their descendant seeks to destroy the ideal of racial harmony and replace it with pegasus supremacy. In his view, there are only two types of peoples: Pegasi and everyone else.\n\n It's hard to pinpoint the exact root of Swift Storm's views. Perhaps it was from him growing up in a community comprised almost entirely of pegasi, or from witnessing the brutality of the primarily earthpony Warbands. Regardless of the original reason, these views would be made much stronger by the loss in the Thunder-War. In his eyes, the War was irrefutable evidence that the Lightning Scavenger's ideals had failed, that the groundbound ponies within their nation were naturally weak and inferior creatures. Such would give rise to his political movement, the so-called 'Enclavists'."
 lit_hookhoof: "§RRetired Raider§!"
 lit_hookhoof_desc: "Nopony could of predicted that Hook Hoof would be the leader of anything even remotely resembling a civilized nation. The ex-warlord was once one of the most feared and renown raiders within the Appleloosan region. The scorched ruins of former settlements still litter the land along the Azureway's eastern bank, burnt-out monuments to the brutality and might of Hook Hoof.\n\n Those days are long behind him though. After amassing more wealth and soldiers than most small nations, the fearsome raider declared his army disbanded and retired to a quiet life as a bar owner. Most of his former raiders either followed their leader or joined up with other raider gangs in the area. Since then, the name Hook Hoof has slowly faded into obscurity.\n\n As for the stallion himself, he spends near all of his days within his bar, the Crooked Bloatsprite. Distilling and selling alcohol has become his livlihood, a career that he has expressed a great deal of contentment with. Indeed, he likely never would of gone into politics at all if not for the crippling defeat in the Thunder-War. This event sparked something within Hook Hoof, leading to him calling for a new movement across the nation. The Lightning Scavengers had been rendered weak by their previous period of relative stability and peace. This weakness would be the end of them if they did not change their course.\n\n Now, he stands as the strongest stallion within the nation. Under his reign, the Lightning Scavengers shall avenge all of the old wrongs and reclaim those lands that are rightfully theirs. For the Scavengers! For Hook Hoof!"
 lit_insaneskybreaker: "§pThe Platinum King§!"
 lit_insaneskybreaker_desc: "The Speaker of the Scavenger's, The Savior of Ponykind, The Bringer of Enlightenment, The Guardian of Cloudsdale, The Overseer of Weather, The Winglead of Thundertown, The Mayor of Lightning Point, The Final Minister, The Great Avenger, The Bearer of the Elements, The Chosen, The Dawnbringer, The Nightsayer, He Who Rules All Under the Sky, His Royal Majesty, King Skybreaker! With his kingdom forged and his reign secured, there is little that can stand against the might and power of The Platnium King!"
 lit_insaneswiftstorm: "§cUnhinged Supremacist§!"
 lit_insaneswiftstorm_desc: "Within a sky full of degeneracy and decadence, one pegasus stands alone as a beacon of purity. Untainted by the filth that infests the world today, the incorruptable Swift Storm seeks to purify his own race. Subversives and degenerates control one of the Enclave's most sacred cities, reigning over the misguided and ignorant masses. The only way to save the pegasus race is to remove these corrupting elements. Soon, all pegasi shall recognize their hero and savior. For he is their only hope for salvation!
