 TITLE_ZEBRA_LEGION_SUBTITLE:0 "LEGIONNAIRES"
 legionnaires:0 "Legionnaires"
 
 tech_legion:0 "Legionary Training"
 tech_legion_desc:0 "We shall revive the Ancient Zebrican Concept of the Legionary. Such soldiers were said to have supreme discipline, and be one of the most flexible fighting forces in history. In fact, while they changed a lot over time, Legionnaires were still used during the Great war!\n"
 tech_legion2:0 "Oppres et Antecessum"
 tech_legion2_desc:0 "Suppression and Advance.\nA rather simply concept, but effective, especially against the filth of the Wasteland. It was one of the Tactics that helped Legionnaires all across Zebrica, during the glorious Unification-Wars, to smash the lesser tribes that stood against them. Today, it shall serve us well once more!\n"
 tech_legion_offense:0 "Doctrinam Zenusian"
 tech_legion_offense_desc:0 "The Zenusian Doctrine, named after the famous warlord of the zebrican unification-Wars, can still serve us today. Zenus espoused, that, using a slow, but utterly dedicated and trained force, one could create breaks in the enemy line, that would then be exploited by faster Units, to throw the enemy backline into Chaos.\n"
 tech_legion_offense2:0 "Perpetuuni mihi Præcipe"
 tech_legion_offense2_desc:0 "With our superior Discipline and Organization, we have no need to reorganize our formations as frequently as lesser armies. Therefore, we can maintain a relentless offensive, depleting not only the enemies numbers and morale, but also their Cohesion, until they are unable to muster a porper Defense.\n"
 tech_legion_defense:0 "Delegationis Mandatum"
 tech_legion_defense_desc:0 "During fierce battles, it is likely that commanding officers of many units might get wounded or even killed. To preserve unit-cohesion, and the integrity of the Greater Legion, each soldier shall be trained to fulfill the obligations of one rank above them, so that officers may be replaced in the Field!\n"
 tech_legion_defense2:0 "Urbes superposuit Basibus"
 tech_legion_defense2_desc:0 "If one had to choose a single reason why the zebrican Legionaries managed to unify the Empire, it would be their mastery of Fieldworks. Within hours a Legion could turn an unassuming hill into an earthen fort, strong enough to withstand light artillery. Within a few days, said fort is a large complex of trenches, firing positions and underground Shelters.\n"
 tech_legion3:0 "Montem Disciplina"
 tech_legion3_desc:0 "Our Legions are currently suffering from ambushes, and low mobility in mountainous terrain. Through a series of excercises and doctrinal shifts, we shall make sure they are as comfortable in such Terrain, as can be.\n"
 tech_legion4:0 "Urbana Impetum"
 tech_legion4_desc:0 "Recently, our Legionaries have found themselves fighting in Cities, or assaulting fortified positions more and more. The Legionary codes have prescribed solutions to these situations, though it will take time and training to implement them, and drill them into our Soldiers.\n"
