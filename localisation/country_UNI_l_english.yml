#Initial#

 unity_start_1:0 "IMP Pre-Production"
 unity_start_1_desc:0 "The Impelled Metamorphosis Potion was a consumable megaspell that could transform the imbiber into an Alicorn, granting them massive magical power and wings. While the project wasn't finished by the end, the MAS was ready for deployment. All it was waiting on was the result of pony trials"
 
 unity_start_2:0 "The End of the World"
 unity_start_2_desc:0 "As the Megaspells rained down, the ponies in the Maripony facility were the first to be targetted. Though they weren't destroyed, something horrific happened"
 
 
 unity_start_3:0 "The Wasteland"
 unity_start_3_desc:0 "Equestria was gone, but Unity survived. Eventually, she decided to see if anything else did too"
 
 unity_start_4:0 "Face Off"
 unity_start_4_desc:0 "Unity was made of many minds. Of those many minds, 3 truly stood out above the rest. And those three didn't always agree..."

###GODDESS###

 goddess_1:0 "Goddess"
 goddess_1_desc:0 "Trixie was first, and she would remain first. The controlling mind of the Alicorns, she alone realized just how Great and Powerful Unity was. And she was determined to let everyone feel the greatness and power"
 
 goddess_preacher:0 "Finding Preachers"
 goddess_preacher_desc:0 "Not many can hear the telepathic communications of the Goddess. But there are some. These souls would be perfect to spread the glory of Unity"

 goddess_slaver_1:0 "Worker Caste"
 goddess_slaver_1_desc:0 "We can't expect the Goddess to do all the work. Using wastelanders as cheap labor allows the Goddess and her alicorns to focus on the important things"
 
 goddess_shared_1:0 "Cleaning House"
 goddess_shared_1_desc:0 "Despite all our power, We do not even control the area directly outside the Maripoy facility. It's time to fix that"
 
 goddess_shared_2:0 "Ministry Mare of the MAS"
 goddess_shared_2_desc:0 "Across the river to the southwest there was an old Stable containing a number of the Ministry of Arcane Science top officials. It appears they not only survived the war, but actually thrived. And they still hold allegiance to the Equestrian Government and the MAS itself. As Twilight Sparkle was the head of that particular ministry, We may be able to find a use for them"
 
 goddess_shared_3:0 "The Stable Dweller"
 goddess_shared_3_desc:0 "Somewhere in the Wasteland there is a pony. Indestructable, immensely powerful, and with a determination that has been so rare even during the war. This little pony has been a thorn in Our side for some time, killing Our Alicorns with impunity. This Littlepip must be dealt with, but perhaps We can convince her that We are worth working with"
 
 ###RED EYE ALLIANCE###
 
 goddess_canon_1:0 "The Red Eye Alliance"
 goddess_canon_1_desc:0 ""
  
 goddess_redeye_1:0 "Material Aid"
 goddess_redeye_1_desc:0 "Red Eye is promising to give us ponies for Unity. In return, he is asking for the ability to use Alicorns. By providing him with some IMP for his own use, he can make his own...though they will still be connected to us"
 
 goddess_redeye_2:0 "Military Aid"
 goddess_redeye_2_desc:0 "With Red Eye providing us parts of his workforce, it makes sense to provide him with some soldiers to make up for it"
 
 goddess_redeye_3:0 "Worker Slaves"
 goddess_redeye_3_desc:0 "Alicorns are beings of power and rule. They are not designed for factory work and construction. That leaves Us with a bit of a problem, as We need construction done. Red Eye though has a lot of slaves already. Though the ones he sends Us are destined to join Us, maybe We can ask for some that can actually do work"
 
 goddess_redeye_4:0 "Factory Construction"
 goddess_redeye_4_desc:0 "The MAS left Us with a lot of IMP after the war. However, if We wish to spread Unity to the entire world, we need more than just magic. We need weapons and infastructure. We need factories. Red Eye  has more tools and machines in Fillydeplhia than he can actually use. Why not ask him for some?"
 
 goddess_redeye_5:0 "Inviting Red Eye's Researchers"
 goddess_redeye_5_desc:0 "We have heard that one of Red Eye's researchers stands out above the rest. If we were to invitie him to Maripony, he would have immediate access to much more IMP than he would in Filidelphia"
 
 goddess_redeye_6:0 "Rads for the Rad Engine"
 goddess_redeye_6_desc:0 "Red Eye has created a mechanical engine that runs solely on radiation. As there is a lot of radioactive material in the wasteland, this is a perfect fuel source except for one thing: radiation is poison for ponies. But not for Us"
 
 goddess_redeye_7:0 "Going Around the Everfree"
 goddess_redeye_7_desc:0 "The Everfree is a dangerous place. One where even We don't dare tred. If We wish to open up supply lines with Red Eye, We will need to find a way around. After a quick visit, the locals won't object. Even if they do, what can they actually do about it?"
 
 goddess_redeye_8:0 "IMP Experimentation"
 goddess_redeye_8_desc:0 "Red Eye made sure to build a solid scientific base, a heritige he got from his old Stable. These researchers are trained in Earth Pony ways, and know technology, but Red Eye wishes to branch out. He has a team working to replicate Twilight Sparkle's work in making IMP. If We were to give him some, he would be likely to help us in kind"
 
 goddess_redeye_9:0 "Red Eye's Bodyguard"
 goddess_redeye_9_desc:0 "By putting an Alicorn team close to Red Eye, We can more tightly bind our alliance"
 
 goddess_redeye_10:0 "An Army for Red Eye"
 goddess_redeye_10_desc:0 "Red Eye's army is large and powerful. By sending Alicorn fighters to bolster his rank, Our alliance can become even stronger"
 
 goddess_unification:0 "Invite Red Eye to Unity"
 goddess_unification_desc:0 "It is time to give Red Eye our greatest gift. What happens next depends of what We have done, and what he will do"
 
 goddess_redeye_11:0 "Tenpony Tower"
 goddess_redeye_11_desc:0 "Tenpony Tower was the Manehatten hub of the Ministry of Arcane Science. The shields managed to hold off the megaspells, and is currently home to a semi-thriving society. "
 
 goddess_redeye_12:0 "The Enclave"
 goddess_redeye_12_desc:0 "Minutes before the end of the war, the Pegasi of Cloudsdale turned traitor and delcared independence from Equestria. Though Couldsdale was hit by the second megaspell, the rest of the Pegasi chose to follow their example and turn Rebel. For 200 years they stayed up there and created a cloud cover across all Equestria. They still maintain a massive military presence, and We will have to deal with them somehow. That being said, deal with doesn't need to be destructive"
 
 goddess_redeye_13:0 "Controlling the Sun"
 goddess_redeye_13_desc:0 "The MAS created a megaspell that could wield the sun like a weapon. With Our power, We should be able to do so much more"
 
 goddess_redeye_14:0 "Controlling the Weather"
 goddess_redeye_14_desc:0 "The Neighvarro facility is the home of the Single Pony Project. A single pony can use it to control the MASEBS towers that dot Equestria to control the weather. A single alicorn in the machine should be enough to allow Us to control the weather for ourselves."
 
 goddess_2:0 "The One True Goddess"
 goddess_2_desc:0 "Celestia is dead. Luna is dead. We are the One True Goddes. The Great and Powerful UNITY"
 
 goddess_redeye_c_1:0 "Technological Aid"
 goddess_redeye_c_1_desc:0 "Red Eye has people working on many technical marvels, including IMP. By working with him, We may be able to figure out how to make Our alicorns even better."
  
 goddess_redeye_15:0 "Cracking Secrets"
 goddess_redeye_15_desc:0 "Thanks to Our work with Red Eye, We have gone farther than even Twilight Sparkle could. With all this new knoweldge, We can finally work to fixing the sole flaw in our Alicorns: The fact they are all female."
 
 
 
 
 ###INDEPENDENT###
 
 unity_slaver_1:0 "Supporting Independent Slavers"
 unity_slaver_1_desc:0 "While We will need a separate source of ponypower to make up for Our inability to breed, We must make sure that these sources stay subservient to Us. By supporting smaller slaver organizations We can ensure Our suppliers will remain under Our control."
 
 unity_slaver_2:0 "Laissez Faire"
 unity_slaver_2_desc:0 "These slavers have been doing their things for a very long time. By being "hooves off", we can capitalize on their OWn experience and let them do the work for Us."
 
 unity_slaver_3:0 "Expanding Their Output"
 unity_slaver_3_desc:0 "While the slaver organizations in Our sphere of influence are good, using alicorns to support their own troops will make them even more effective."
 
 unity_slaver_4:0 "Protecting Trade Routes"
 unity_slaver_4_desc:0 "By keeping the less organized or more bloodthirsty raider gangs out of Our way, we can both ensure more slaves reach Maripony, and other ponies grow less cautious around Us."
 
 unity_slaver_5:0 "Offer Unity"
 unity_slaver_5_desc:0 "The time has come for the slavers to leave Our sphere of influence and enter Our fold properly. By offering to make alicorns of the leaders, we can take over the leadership without anyone realizing that their old bosses aren't their old bosses anymore."
 
 unity_slaver_6:0 "Slaver Caste"
 unity_slaver_6_desc:0 "The time has come for the slaver gangs to leave Our sphere of influence and enter Our fold. By keeping the old bosses where they are and giving them marginal rewards, We can turn them into just another type of slave."
 
 unity_slaver_7:0 "In Their Place"
 unity_slaver_7_desc:0 "Though Our takeover of the slaver powers of the Wasteland was accepted by some, others have refused. It is time to take those who dare defy Our will, and put them in their place."
 
 unity_slaver_8:0 "Direct Control"
 unity_slaver_8_desc:0 "Slavers are notoriously fickle. Any promise of allegience won't last. If We wish to truly control the Wasteland through them, We must put Our people in charge."
 
 unity_slaver_9:0 "Priests of a New Goddess"
 unity_slaver_9_desc:0 "Alicorns are inherently superior to normal ponies. Most ponies know this and resent it. If We wish to properly control them, we need to put ponies on top that We can trust. Those who can hear Our words and obey."
 
 unity_slaver_10:0 "Mouthpiece of the Goddess"
 unity_slaver_10_desc:0 "Alicorns are inherently superior to normal ponies. All who look upon Us will bow down with awe. And any order We give shall be obeyed. \n Or else."
 
 unity_slaver_11:0 "Raid Efficiency Training"
 unity_slaver_11_desc:0 "With the power Our alicorns allow, We can increase the power of the slavers We employ."
 
 unity_slaver_12:0 "Holy Warriors"
 unity_slaver_12_desc:0 "Our fanatic followers fight with a ferocity unforseen. They do not just fight because they fear Us. They fight becaue they love Us."
 
 unity_slaver_13:0 "Overseers"
 unity_slaver_13_desc:0 "Though Our alicorns are precious, they allow Us to see everything they see. Taking them off Our fighitng forces to act as overseers with the slaver organizations under Our sphere will give Us tighter control over them."
 
 unity_slaver_14:0 "More Than Loyalty"
 unity_slaver_14_desc:0 "The preachers that We have sent have done better than We had ever expected. The ponies of these slaver groups, slave and slaver alike, truly believe in what they have been told. Many often offer themselves to Unity, rather than having to be dragged to it. This is not loyalty. This is fatih."
 
 unity_slaver_15:0 "Phase Out Old Guard"
 unity_slaver_15_desc:0 "Though for the most part the slavers under Our sphere have been following well. However, there are many in these groups whose rise to the top was halted by Our intervention. Getting rid of them should make Our full takeover much easier."
 
 unity_slaver_16:0 "A Better Class of Slave"
 unity_slaver_16_desc:0 "These slavers do not work for Us. They serve Us. Though they wear no chains, they are simply just more slaves."
 unity_slaver_17:0 "Forceful Conversion"
 unity_slaver_17_desc:0 "The zeal Our followers inspire does not spread easily. 200 years of knowing the old goddesses died has left the populace cynical. Those who we can not reach with words, we can reach with power."
 
 unity_slaver_18:0 "Political Unity"
 unity_slaver_18_desc:0 "We manage a large series of separate slaver organizations. Replacing their leaders tied them to Us. Now We need to bind them to each other."
 
 unity_slaver_19:0 "Expanding our Spheres"
 unity_slaver_19_desc:0 "Raiding for more slaves means We need more places to store them. We don't have the capacity at Maripony, so We just need to encourage Our slavers to capture more ground on which to construct holding pens and infastructure."
 
 unity_slaver_20:0 "Tighten the Noose"
 unity_slaver_20_desc:0 "Our slavers work under Our leadership. But We can not run everything, and much of the upper eschelon is still comprised of members of the old gang. We have worked to reduce their autonomy, but it is time for a final confrontation. Force the leadership to bow or die. "
 
 unity_slaver_21:0 "Lessons from Our New Members"
 unity_slaver_21_desc:0 "Having integrated the slavers that We had mostly left alone, We still need to figure out how to deal with the slaving base that We just created. We don't know much about this aspect, but with all the slavers We just brought under Our spell, We can easily pick up that slack."
 
 unity_slaver_22:0 "A Surplus of Slaves"
 unity_slaver_22_desc:0 "One of Our biggest issues is that alicons are not for labor. Alicorns are glorious beings of might and are not for such menial tasks. We do have a surplus of slaves though."
 
 unity_slaver_23:0 "Expanding Slave Output"
 unity_slaver_23_desc:0 "Alicorns are precious. We can not to use them on simple tasks. But by diverting a few to act as overseers, We can get more out of the slaves than We normally would."
 
 unity_slaver_24:0 "Expanding Slave Input"
 unity_slaver_24_desc:0 "Incorperating alicorns with the slaver raiding parties will increase the amount of slaves that Our slavers can capture."
 
 unity_slaver_25:0 "Wall of Meat"
 unity_slaver_25_desc:0 "Though Our alicorns are mighty, every one of them is precious. Though their magical shields can protect them, a physical shield of slaves will protect them even more."
 
 unity_slaver_26_desc:0 "Though are Alicorns are mighty, Our foes are numerous. While their forces may be able to overwhelm Our alicorns on their own, by sprinkling slavers and trained slaves into Our forces, that numerical advantage will decrease drastically."
 unity_slaver_26:0 "Combined Arms"
 
 unity_slaver_27:0 "Expanded Dunking"
 unity_slaver_27_desc:0 "While Our slaves have always been used to bolster Our ranks, We have been lately diverting numbers to work on construction and production. It is time to undo that policy, and send more ponies to the vats."
 
 unity_slaver_28:0 "Slave Housing"
 unity_slaver_28_desc:0 "With all of the slaves We are bringing in, We need places to put them. Expanding the Maripony facility is a high priority."
 
 unity_slaver_29:0 "Creating More IMP"
 unity_slaver_29_desc:0 "With the increase of alicorns, We are starting to run out of pre-war IMP. Though We can not perfectly replicate the formula, We can get close enough."
 
 unity_slaver_30:0 "Administration"
 unity_slaver_30_desc:0 "Our slaving efforts have ensured that We may never dunk everypony. There will always be those that We can control directly. As such, We need to develop proper bureaucracy. Though We can use Our telekinetic threads instead of red tape, We still need to prepare for dealing with managers and administrators."
 
 unity_slaver_31:0 "How Far We've Come"
 unity_slaver_31_desc:0 "With Our control of the minor slavers of the Euqestrian Wasteland, We only have a few obstacles to overcome before We can finally unite all of Equestria once more. Though We still have far to go, We have come far, and it's time to celebrate."
 
 unity_slaver_32:0 "Our Greatest Rival"
 unity_slaver_32_desc:0 "We are not the first to try to unite the slavers of Equestria. There remains one major block to a full monopoly on slaves and slavers. It is time to deal with our old friend: Red Eye."
 
 unity_slaver_33:0 "Where No Slaver Has Gone Before"
 unity_slaver_33_desc:0 "Above the clouds sits the Grand Pegasus Enclave. Pegasi might not be as strong as earth ponies, but their wings allow them access to areas that it previously took alicorns to deal with. The Enclave is not an easy threat to deal with, as their cloud homes are mostly inaccessable, but Twilight Sparkle knew a few tricks to fix that. This war will not be easy, but when the dust settles, Our slave pens will need a new feature: Ceilings."
 
 unity_slaver_34:0 "Ancient Relics"
 unity_slaver_34_desc:0 "The last remnant of the wartime Equestrian government, the Steel Rangers, military arm of the Ministry of Wartime Technology, have been a thorn in our side for a very long time. It is time to show them who the new ruler of Equestria is."
 
 unity_slaver_35:0 "Twilight Sparkle's 2nd Greatest Creation"
 unity_slaver_35_desc:0 "Hidden in the Manehatten Hub of the Ministry of Arcane Science lies a weapon capable of calling down the sun itself as a weapon of mass destruction. The foals who occupy what is known as Tenpony Tower have no idea what they have. We should take it off their hooves."
 
 unity_slaver_36:0 "Wielding the Weather"
 unity_slaver_36_desc:0 "At Neighvarro is one of the only creations of the Ministry of Awesome: The Single Pony Project. If We can take that, We can put one of Our Alicorns in charge of it. Though the Alicorn will be in suspended animation, We will still have control of them, allowing Us to control the weather without leaving the world."
 
 unity_slaver_37:0 "Wielding the Sun"
 unity_slaver_37_desc:0 "With control of Tenpony Tower, the power of Our alicorns will allow Us to use Celestia Prime at will. With the power of the sun at Our beck and call, no one can stop Us."
 
 unity_slaver_38:0 "Slave Mistress of the Equestrian Wastes"
 unity_slaver_38_desc:0 "With all of the great powers in the Equestrian Wateland broken, there is no one who can stand in Our way."
 
 
 ###ALT PATH: PERFECT UNITY###
 goddess_perfection:0 "Perfect Beings"
 goddess_perfection_desc:0 "Alicorns are perfect in almost every way. They grow stronger in radition. They have magic beyond imagining. They can fly. They are great and powerful. They are truly the superior beings."

 goddess_dunking_1:0 "Perfect Unity"
 goddess_dunking_1_desc:0 "There are so many wastelanders out there who don't know the glory of Unity. We must not stop until they are all here with Us."
 
 goddess_master_1:0 "Wasteland Flyover"
 goddess_master_1_desc:0 "Though above the clouds the Enclave rules, under them We can fly with impunity. By passing over the Wasteland, We can get an idea of what We will have to deal with on Our quest to bring Equestria into Unity."
 
 goddess_master_2:0 "Prepare the Wings"
 goddess_master_2_desc:0 "Though Alicorns are inherently powerful, and We have used them in skirmishes with the tainted monsters of Splended Valley, We have little experience with war. If We are to successfully bring all of Equestria to Unity, We must learn not just to fight, but to conquer."
 
 goddess_master_3:0 "Fortifying Our Home"
 goddess_master_3_desc:0 "Maripony is well situated in the middle of nowhere. However, the zebra's still saw fit to target it with a direct strike. It's a testament to pre-war Equestria that the facility survived, but it probably will not survive another strike. There's not much We can do about that, but We can take action to prevent the forces of the Wasteland from being able to invade Us. Setting up some defensive fortifications won't be very hard, and would protect Us against the ground forces that could penetrate Our magic shields."
 
 goddess_master_4:0 "Readying the Vats"
 goddess_master_4_desc:0 "If We are going to bring everypony in the Wasteland into Unity, We will need a lot more IMP."
 
 goddess_master_5:0 "Tainted Auxiliaries"
 goddess_master_5_desc:0 "Taint is comprised of the magical run-off, much of it prototype IMP. The creatures of Splended Valley come from the same magic that created Us, and though it won't be easy, We may be able to use them for Our own ends."
 
 goddess_master_6:0 "Purging the Valley"
 goddess_master_6_desc:0 "Though Alicorns work well in taint, all the ponies we will be bringing to Maripony will not. By bathing Splended Valley in enough magic, We should be able to clear it all out."
 
 goddess_master_7:0 "Prepairing for War"
 goddess_master_7_desc:0 "The ponies of the Wasteland are cynical and harsh. Few will openly join Us in glory. We must show them what the power of Unity truly is before they will accept it."
 
 goddess_master_8:0 "Marching West"
 goddess_master_8_desc:0 "West of Splended Valley is empty...for now."
 
 goddess_master_9:0 "Marching South"
 goddess_master_9_desc:0 "The area south of Maripony is filled with small groups trying to eck out survival in the Wasteland. These groups are separate, alone... and vulnerable."
 
 goddess_master_10:0 "Marching East"
 goddess_master_10_desc:0 "East of Splended Valley lies the Everfree Forest. Though dangerous, the real danger lies farther in the ruins of Fillydelphia. In the heart of pre-war Equestria's industrial machine, a warlord named Red Eye has an army of slaves and mercernaries. Dealing with him will not be an easy task, and will require much preparation, but it is one We must undertake."
 
 goddess_master_11:0 "Fortifying the Gorge"
 goddess_master_11_desc:0 "Between mutated moray eels, and it's sheer width and depth, Gastly Gorge is a mighty defensive terrain feature. With only some minor construction, We can turn it into a nearly impenetrable bastion."
 
 goddess_master_12:0 "Dunking Gorge Town"
 goddess_master_12_desc:0 "It is time to welcome the ponies of Gorge Town to Unity. Though not all will survive the journey to Maripony, those who do will thank Us for Our gift."
 
 goddess_master_13:0 "Using the River"
 goddess_master_13_desc:0 "Between hellhound tunnels, poor soil, and the zebra balefire bombs, the coastal area of Maripony has little in the way of usable shoreline. The northern edge of Gorgetown on the other hand is prime real estate for aquatic construction."
 
 goddess_master_14:0 "Crushing Featherbrush"
 goddess_master_14_desc:0 "A little west of Gorge Town is a pre-war bunker that is currently home to a group of griffon mercernaries that call themselves the Talons. Griffons, being an inferior being, are unable to join Us in Unity. The only option We can give them is death."
 
 goddess_master_15:0 "Land Supplies"
 goddess_master_15_desc:0 "If We are to realize Our dreams of welcoming all ponies to Unity, We must be able to both move ponies from their homes to Maripony, and move food and supplies to Our attack wings."
 
 goddess_master_16:0 "Raiding the Plains"
 goddess_master_16_desc:0 "Across Gastly Gorge lies a set of rolling plains that a group of raiders have made home. These ponies have caused much pain and suffering. It is time for them to invite the Goddess into their lives... whether they like it or not."
 
 goddess_master_17:0 "Sea Supplies"
 goddess_master_17_desc:0 "Though Splended Valley does not have much in the way of good seafront property, using magic to clean up the waterfront will allow Us to shorten Our supply routes dramatically."
 
 goddess_master_18:0 "Purging the Griffons"
 goddess_master_18_desc:0 "Those griffons that persist within Our new land must be dealt with. They can not join Us, and so they must perish."
 
 goddess_master_19:0 "Dunking the Ponies"
 goddess_master_19_desc:0 "Most Talons are griffons, but apparently not all of them. They also had a small amount of ponies within their ranks. Not many, but We can still welcome them to Unity."
 
 goddess_master_20:0 "Talon Weapons"
 goddess_master_20_desc:0 "Alicorns may use magic instead of the projectile weapons favored by other races, but that does not mean other, more specialized weaponry wouldn't be useful. The Talons were using weapons and tactics we hadn't seen before, and We may be able to find a way to integrate them into Our forces."
 
 goddess_master_21:0 "Looting the Bunker"
 goddess_master_21_desc:0 "Featherbrush's Talons had fortified themselves in a pre-war bunker. Pre-war bunkers tend to have neat pre-war stuff. Twilight, being the head of the MAS, knows a lot of tricks that the pre-war government used to hide things. Let's get looting."
 
 goddess_master_22:0 "Talon Tactics"
 goddess_master_22_desc:0 "Griffons fight in a way unlike any pony. Their claws allow them to wield weapons in ways We can not, and their wings allow them the kind of mobility normally restricted to pegasi and alicorns. Now that they are defeated, We can learn from their fighting style and develop some new skills of Our own."
 
 goddess_master_23:0 "Hunting Talon Survivors"
 goddess_master_23_desc:0 "Though the main Talon forces fought to the end, many fighters managed to escape in the chaos of battle. Now they are running around harassing Our fighters and supplies. Using them to develop the muscle memory of Our freshest alicorns will greatly improve Our combat ability, as well as teach Us some valuable lessons."
 
 goddess_master_24:0 "Cleaning Raider Totems"
 goddess_master_24_desc:0 "Raiders aren't exactly the most sanitary folk. Before we can move them to Maripony, We need to do something about this mess."
 
 goddess_master_25:0 "Dunking the Plains Raiders"
 goddess_master_25_desc:0 "Raiders are monsters. Their abhorent practices have left many dead in their wake. These ponies may have lost their way, but in no one is beyond the redemption of Unity."
 
 goddess_master_27:0 "Across the Plains"
 goddess_master_27_desc:0 "The plains south of Ghastly Gorge are large and spacious. Though their length makes it unpleasant to carry supplies, rebuilding the roads across them will be simplicity itself."
 
 goddess_master_26:0 "Repairing the Bridge"
 goddess_master_26_desc:0 "The bridge across Ghastly Gorge is in ill repair. Raiders have little interest in maintenance and construction, and the ponies of Gorge Town feared a maintained bridge would allow the Plain's Raiders to attack more easily. With both groups under Our control, We have nothing to fear, and can repair the bridges with impunity."
 
 goddess_master_28:0 "Dunking Slaves"
 goddess_master_28_desc:0 "Raiders are infamous for taking slaves, and when We destroyed the Plain's Raiders, there were still some of those poor souls left. From this moment on, their suffering is over thanks to Unity."
 
 goddess_master_29:0 "Utilizing Loot"
 goddess_master_29_desc:0 "When We took down the raiders, We were able to secure their supplies of looted materials. While not things We would make or take on Our own, We can still find uses for them."
 
 goddess_master_30:0 "Into the Desert"
 goddess_master_30_desc:0 "Twilight remembers the old Appeloosa in it's heyday. Apparently after the war, several settlers moved to an area nearby and named themselves after the old city. They now sit as the center of commerce in the South. Though We have little use for trade, We are more than happy to welcome them all into Unity. "
 
 goddess_master_31:0 "Remains of Cloudsdale"
 goddess_master_31_desc:0 ""
 
 goddess_master_32:0 "Rock Farmers"
 goddess_master_32_desc:0 "The rock farmers of the south farm rocks. They're not very important, but they're there, and they're ponies. So they get to join Unity"
 
 goddess_master_33:0 "Fishers of Ponies"
 goddess_master_33_desc:0 ""
 
 goddess_master_34:0 "Clearing the Ghouls"
 goddess_master_34_desc:0 "The area around the ruins of Cloudsdale are infesed with ghouls, most of them "survivors" of the cloud city's destruction. Feral ghouls can't become Alicorns, so destroying them is really the only option"

 goddess_master_41_desc:0 ""
 
 goddess_master_42:0 "Using Rad Fish"

And with the world shaking, Trixie fell into the massive vats of IMP. The IMP ripped her body apart, but though her body was broken, her mind held mostly intact. And her powers grew exponentially. And as she realized just how powerful she had become, her ego, long suppressed, came to bear. And she had a realization of just what the IMP was capable of. And though the chaos of the megaspell hit had started to subside, it grew again ad ponies began being telekinetically dragged into the vats. And as each pony was dragged in, she became stronger, as their minds were added to her own. Some came back out again, now Alicorns, but others were dissolved, being fully added to the thing that was now Unity.

Though many of the minds that were a part of Unity got absorbed in the mess, three distinct minds, and the personalities that were once with them, managed to remain somewhat intact. The first was the first: Trixie, the Great and Powerful. Not only was she the first and originating mind that created Unity, her vast ego kept it together and kept her personality dominant. Second was Twilight Sparkle: Element of Magic, Mare of the Ministry of Arcane Science, and the effective third in line to the throne of Equestria itself. Though she was late to entering Unity due to a malfunctioning safe room, her unmatched raw magical power and vast intellect kept her together in unity. Despite this, she had a profound sense of guilt and failure over the destruction of the world and her part in it. The third mind was actually two minds, working together. Mosaic and Gesalt were twins, two of the Minstry of Arcane Science’s best administrators, and capable of advanced telepathy, acting in unity even before becoming Unity. As such, they managed to keep together by working together. Though the junior partner in the triumvirate, it was their magic that allowed Unity to be the hive mind it was, controlling the alicorns as well as herself. This was the state of unity when things suddenly came to a head. What triggered the conflict no one really knows, but the three began fighting within the mind. Trixie sought to use Unity to take over the wastes, using the way the alicorns were naturally adapted to the wasteland as an excuse to take over. Twilight sought to rebuild Equestria the way it was, using whatever pre-war organizations that remained to undo the damages. The twins were not grandiose planners, and sought to make Unity just another member of the wasteland community, conquering nobody, and protecting anyone they could.  In the end, one personality became dominant through…"

 goddess_redeye.1.d:0 "A mental command echoed across the wasteland: "Come to Maripony". Most who heard it dismissed it as dash withdrawl, alchool poisoning, or just indegestion. But there were a few who listened. Some died crossing Splended Valley. Others made it and were inducted to Unity. Still other went home to preach the glorious oppurtunity offered by Unity. But of all the ponies who heard the Goddess's call, only one had the mental fortitude and force of will to try to talk back. \n And thus it was that Red Eye, a stable dweller from Stable 101, came to Maripony \n Together they converted all of Stable 101 to Alicorns and used this new force to take the slaver haven of Filidelphia. \n But this was long ago. Now Red Eye was the head of a slave empire stretching halfway across Equestria. Back then there was a simple trade of slaves in return for the help of the alicorns, then both fell back to consolidate their gains. \n As the Goddess prepared to enter the Wasteland as a power, she came to a decision:"

Should I accept this, I will be unable to sheppard my New Unity, and many of my Talons will rebel. But if I do not accept, the tempermental Goddess will likely try to start a fight. She may listen to reason if I can convince her of the glory of another Unity, so she won't be alone, but that's a bit of a long shot"

If we were to send a team of Alicorns to act as Red Eye's bodyguard, it will boost his prestige and image amongst the wasteland, as well as protect him from any threats that may arise. \n We can take this one step further though. These Alicorns could be trained as a proper bodyguard, to protect Red Eye, but they could also have another layer of training. Should conflict break out, they can be trained as assassins, ready to kill Red Eye if the oppurtunity arises. As any conflict would invlolve too much mental power to control everything at once, only one underlying layer can be put in place"

He has many soldiers, but with a few Alicorns serving in his army, his forces will be even stronger \n This presents us with an oppurtunity though. With our soldiers in his ranks, should conflict start between us, We can have all those soldiers turn on him, causing mass chaos and much damage. They won't be able to fight as well if they're looking for those oppurtunities, but they will represent a significant increase in Red Eye's combat abilities.

By asking Red Eye for extra slaves, We can work on perfecting the dosage, manipulating the formula, and making Our Alicorns even better \n There is a major flaw in this plan though. Should Red Eye ever try to betray Us, this flow of slaves quickly dries up. While We could use every slave for the IMP, We could also set aside a few to work as a breeding group, giving Us a stockpile in case of betrayal. This of course means We won't be able to experiment as much, so it is only useful if Red Eye does have less than honorable intentions"

Red Eye considers Alicorns too valuable to use in any industrial capacity, but if We were to volunteer a couple of our Alicorns to get into the crater and gather the materials themselves, we should be able to increase their output greatly. \n While this will certainly make our alliance stronger, this also gives Us a chance to sabotage Red Eye’s efforts if war breaks out.

The one the Alicorn called the Goddess has promised us the power of her Alicorn forces in return for sending some of our slave stock to Maripony for her use. Doing so would put us in bad graces with Red Eye's slavers in Filidelphia, but with Alicorns at our back, we shouldn't have to deal with him ever again"

Her army of alicorns has ravaged the wasteland ever since. That is until today. [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces managed to push her monsters back to the facility itself. The Goddess posessesed immense magical powers, and held off the attacking forces as long as she could, but eventually even she was overwhelmed by the sheer power that was arrayed against her. During the fighting, most of the vats of Impelled Metamorphosis Potion, the magic power that was used to create Alicorns, were destroyed. Strangely enough, once the battle was decided, she fought alone, sending all of her surviving alicorns away.

 ###BLACK BOOK Events###
 
 unity_pop_bb.1.t:0 "The Assault on Canterlot"
 unity_pop_bb.1.d:0 "The last few days have been a disaster. The Pink Cloud had an effect on Alicorns that no one had expected: It had cut them off from Unity. Though they could operate for a short while within the cloud, too long and they would gain new personalities and even some memories from before they were Alicorns. Worst of all, the leader of the early search parties, an Alicorn called Nightseer, had taken control of the Alicorns who had broken free and declared themselves independent. While this may be an oppurtunity to back out and find a new solution. However, by this point many resources have already been devoted. With small strike forces running in and out before they break free, it is still possible to get the Black Book. However any strike force not only has to deal with the indestrutable ghouls and other monsters in the Cloud, but also with Nightseer and her forces. The situation is dire, but not hopeless"
 unity_pop_bb.1.a:0 "Let's try this again"
 
 unity_pop.1.t:0 "The Population Problem "
 unity_pop.1.d:0 "If Alicorns truly want to survive in the wastes, there must be children. Unity was of several minds on how to approachi this. Twilight, the pony who created the Impelled Metamorphosis Potion in the first place, believes that the fact that it only creates females is a flaw with the IMP itself and can be fixed with focused research and effort. The Twins, less ambitious, thought that breeding programs with the wasteland ponies would be a good solution. Getting males from the wasteland would fix this problem, though it would require a massive dip in Ego and dignity. Trixie, valuing both those things, had a 3rd option. During the war, the Equestrian Government had found a Zebra book of necromancy: The Black Book of...something unpronouncable. The book is supposed to hold spells of immense power. Trixie is sure that if she could get her tendrils on the book she could magic the problem away"

As such, the most likely place for the Black Book to be is in the Ministry Hub in Canterlot. Hunting for the book in Canterlot will be difficult, but before doing that, a path to Canterlot must be opened first"

Thanks to Twilight Sparkle, We know how it works. If We could gain access to the MAS facility, We could use it. Unlike many pre-war buildings though, this one remains occupied. Going by the name Tenpony Tower, these ponies control the megaspell, whether they realize it or not. \n This leaves us with two options. We could try to convince the occupants to accept our control of the weapon. After all, they're the descendants of Twilight's people, and may listen to 'her' pleas.

Greens are the most powerful of all our Alicorns, having access to a massive variety of spells as well as serving as a conduit directly to us, but they have the massive weakness of needing to be static when doing their grandest attacks.

If We fly through We can bypass many of the most dangerous foes other than the manticores, but the team could be spotted while approaching.

If Our team was quiet enough, We could hide away and ambush anyone who tries to use Celestia Prime, using it when no one is looking. Should the team power through the tower's defenses, We can simply occupy the megaspell chamber, using it ourselves as much as we desire. Should Our team be magically powerful enough, We can temporarily disable the megaspell until We can properly occupy the tower. Or if all else fails, We can just destroy the megaspell entirely.

 unity_tenpony_result.7.d:0 "What is up, Equestrian Wasteland? I'm your host, DJ Pon3, and I'm here to bring you the news. Everypony here at Tenpony Tower woke up to the sounds of gunfire today, as a full wing of alicorns assaulted our tower. Despite the best efforts of our security forces, they made it quite far up the tower before being stopped. They ended up causing quite a lot of damage in the Administrative District, destroying entire floors before being taken down. It'll likely take quite a lot of time and caps to repair, and we'll never gain back the lives lost to their rampage."

Tenpony Tower had a nasty surprise today, as a full wing of alicorns decided to fight their way through our gates. Despite the best efforts of our security forces, they managed to fight their way through much of our tower, doing a lot of damage as they went. They were eventually put down, and repairs are already underway, but this situation raises a lot of concerns regarding the motives of these oh-so-benevolent alicorns."

A few alicorns were just trotting by, and decided that our lovely tower would make a great place to live. So, they walked right on in our front door and applied for residency. Unfortunately for them, we have a strict no alicorns allowed policy. So, their polite application devolved into a less polite battle, with them fighting their way past our security forces. Now, they've taken up residency withinin the Administrative District. Our security forces are hard at work trying to evict our new residents, and I wish them the best."

 unity_tenpony_result.10.d:0 "Hello, Equestrian Wasteland! It's everyponies favorite DJ here with some news. Early this morning, a full wing of alicorns assaulted our very own Tenpony Tower! They decided to do a head on assault, attempting to force their way through our entrance! Little did they know that they were going to their deaths, as our security forces proved themselves more than capable in taking on a few of those mutated freaks! Our security forces had minimal casualties, and no civilians were harmed. The same can't be said about the alicorns though."
