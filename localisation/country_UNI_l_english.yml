 goddess_redeye_2:0 "Military Aid"
 goddess_redeye_2_desc:0 "With Red Eye providing us parts of his workforce, it makes sense to provide him with some soldiers to make up for it"
 goddess_redeye_3:0 "Worker Slaves"
 goddess_redeye_3_desc:0 "Alicorns are beings of power and rule. They are not designed for factory work and construction. That leaves Us with a bit of a problem, as We need construction done. Red Eye though has a lot of slaves already. Though the ones he sends Us are destined to join Us, maybe We can ask for some that can actually do work"
 goddess_redeye_4:0 "Factory Construction"
 goddess_redeye_4_desc:0 "The MAS left Us with a lot of IMP after the war. However, if We wish to spread Unity to the entire world, we need more than just magic. We need weapons and infastructure. We need factories. Red Eye  has more tools and machines in Fillydeplhia than he can actually use. Why not ask him for some?"
 goddess_redeye_5:0 "Inviting Red Eye's Researchers"
 goddess_redeye_5_desc:0 "We have heard that one of Red Eye's researchers stands out above the rest. If we were to invitie him to Maripony, he would have immediate access to much more IMP than he would in Filidelphia"
 newfocus_14_desc:0 "We really need to solve our population problem. Red Eye has gathered a prodigious number of scientists. Drawing on Twilight's memory and Red Eye's scientists, we should be able to fix the IMP to start producing males in no time"
 goddess_redeye_6:0 "Rads for the Rad Engine"
 goddess_redeye_6_desc:0 "Red Eye has created a mechanical engine that runs solely on radiation. As there is a lot of radioactive material in the wasteland, this is a perfect fuel source except for one thing: radiation is poison for ponies. But not for Us"
 goddess_redeye_7:0 "Going Around the Everfree"
 goddess_redeye_7_desc:0 "The Everfree is a dangerous place. One where even We don't dare tred. If We wish to open up supply lines with Red Eye, We will need to find a way around. After a quick visit, the locals won't object. Even if they do, what can they actually do about it?"

 goddess_redeye_12:0 "The Enclave"
 goddess_redeye_12_desc:0 "Minutes before the end of the war, the Pegasi of Cloudsdale turned traitor and delcared independence from Equestria. Though Couldsdale was hit by the second megaspell, the rest of the Pegasi chose to follow their example and turn Rebel. For 200 years they stayed up there and created a cloud cover across all Equestria. They still maintain a massive military presence, and We will have to deal with them somehow. That being said, deal with doesn't need to be destructive"
 goddess_redeye_13:0 "Controlling the Sun"
 goddess_redeye_13_desc:0 "The MAS created a megaspell that could wield the sun like a weapon. With Our power, We should be able to do so much more"
 goddess_redeye_14:0 "Controlling the Weather"
 goddess_redeye_14_desc:0 "The Neighvarro facility is the home of the Single Pony Project. A single pony can use it to control the MASEBS towers that dot Equestria to control the weather. A single alicorn in the machine should be enough to allow Us to control the weather for ourselves."

And with the world shaking, Trixie fell into the massive vats of IMP. The IMP ripped her body apart, but though her body was broken, her mind held mostly intact. And her powers grew exponentially. And as she realized just how powerful she had become, her ego, long suppressed, came to bear. And she had a realization of just what the IMP was capable of. And though the chaos of the megaspell hit had started to subside, it grew again ad ponies began being telekinetically dragged into the vats. And as each pony was dragged in, she became stronger, as their minds were added to her own. Some came back out again, now Alicorns, but others were dissolved, being fully added to the thing that was now Unity.

 unity_start.4.d:0 "Though taking the name Unity, the mind that controlled the Alicorns was not perfectly united. Though many of the minds that were a part of Unity got absorbed in the mess, three distinct minds, and the personalities that were once with them, managed to remain somewhat intact. The first was the first: Trixie, the Great and Powerful. Not only was she the first and originating mind that created Unity, her vast ego kept it together and kept her personality dominant. Second was Twilight Sparkle: Element of Magic, Mare of the Ministry of Arcane Science, and the effective third in line to the throne of Equestria itself. Though she was late to entering Unity due to a malfunctioning safe room, her unmatched raw magical power and vast intellect kept her together in unity. Despite this, she had a profound sense of guilt and failure over the destruction of the world and her part in it. The third mind was actually two minds, working together. Mosaic and Gesalt were twins, two of the Minstry of Arcane Science’s best administrators, and capable of advanced telepathy, acting in unity even before becoming Unity. As such, they managed to keep together by working together. Though the junior partner in the triumvirate, it was their magic that allowed Unity to be the hive mind it was, controlling the alicorns as well as herself. This was the state of unity when things suddenly came to a head. What triggered the conflict no one really knows, but the three began fighting within the mind. Trixie sought to use Unity to take over the wastes, using the way the alicorns were naturally adapted to the wasteland as an excuse to take over. Twilight sought to rebuild Equestria the way it was, using whatever pre-war organizations that remained to undo the damages. The twins were not grandiose planners, and sought to make Unity just another member of the wasteland community, conquering nobody, and protecting anyone they could.  In the end, one personality became dominant through…"

But there were a few who listened. Some died crossing Splended Valley. Others made it and were inducted to Unity. Still other went home to preach the glorious oppurtunity offered by Unity. But of all the ponies who heard the Goddess's call, only one had the mental fortitude and force of will to try to talk back. /n And thus it was that Red Eye, a stable dweller from Stable 101, came to Maripony /n Together they converted all of Stable 101 to Alicorns and used this new force to take the slaver haven of Filidelphia. /n But this was long ago. Now Red Eye was the head of a slave empire stretching halfway across Equestria. Back then there was a simple trade of slaves in return for the help of the alicorns, then both fell back to consolidate their gains. /n As the Goddess prepared to enter the Wasteland as a power, she came to a decision:"

Should I accept this, I will be unable to sheppard my New Unity, and many of my Talons will rebel. But if I do not accept, the tempermental Goddess will likely try to start a fight.

 unity_pop.0.d:0 "If Alicorns truly want to survive in the wastes, there must be children. Unity was of several minds on how to approachi this. Twilight, the pony who created the Impelled Metamorphosis Potion in the first place, believes that the fact that it only creates females is a flaw with the IMP itself and can be fixed with focused research and effort. The Twins, less ambitious, thought that breeding programs with the wasteland ponies would be a good solution. Getting males from the wasteland would fix this problem, though it would require a massive dip in Ego and dignity. Trixie, valuing both those things, had a 3rd option. During the war, the Equestrian Government had found a Zebra book of necromancy: The Black Book of...something unpronouncable. The book is supposed to hold spells of immense power. Trixie is sure that if she could get her tendrils on the book she could magic the problem away"
 unity_pop_bb.0.t:0 "A Pre-War Investigation"
 unity_pop_bb.0.d:0 "The Black Book was found on the corpse of a Zebra who had been arrested for heresy in Zebratown. After he comitted suicide in the Zebratown prison the book was impounded by the Ministry of Image. The Ministry Mare of Image, Rarity, kept the book for herself. As such, the most likely place for the Black Book to be is in the Ministry Hub in Canterlot. Hunting for the book in Canterlot will be difficult, but before doing that, a path to Canterlot must be opened first"
 unity_pop_bb.1.d:0 "The last few days have been a disaster. The Pink Cloud had an effect on Alicorns that no one had expected: It had cut them off from Unity. Though they could operate for a short while within the cloud, too long and they would gain new personalities and even some memories from before they were Alicorns. Worst of all, the leader of the early search parties, an Alicorn called Nightseer, had taken control of the Alicorns who had broken free and declared themselves independent. While this may be an oppurtunity to back out and find a new solution. However, by this point many resources have already been devoted. With small strike forces running in and out before they break free, it is still possible to get the Black Book. However any strike force not only has to deal with the indestrutable ghouls and other monsters in the Cloud, but also with Nightseer and her forces. The situation is dire, but not hopeless"

If we were to send a team of Alicorns to act as Red Eye's bodyguard, it will boost his prestige and image amongst the wasteland, as well as protect him from any threats that may arise. /n We can take this one step further though. These Alicorns could be trained as a proper bodyguard, to protect Red Eye, but they could also have another layer of training. Should conflict break out, they can be trained as assassins, ready to kill Red Eye if the oppurtunity arises. As any conflict would invlolve too much mental power to control everything at once, only one underlying layer can be put in place"

With our soldiers in his ranks, should conflict start between us, We can have all those soldiers turn on him, causing mass chaos and much damage.

Should Red Eye ever try to betray Us, this flow of slaves quickly dries up. While We could use every slave for the IMP, We could also set aside a few to work as a breeding group, giving Us a stockpile in case of betrayal. This of course means We won't be able to experiment as much, so it is only useful if Red Eye does have less than honorable intentions"

While finding radiation is easy enough given Fillydelphia took a direct hit during the war, actually getting it is extremely dangerous. For anyone who isn’t an Alicorn that is. Red Eye considers Alicorns too valuable to use in any industrial capacity, but if We were to volunteer a couple of our Alicorns to get into the crater and gather the materials themselves, we should be able to increase their output greatly. /n While this will certainly make our alliance stronger, this also gives Us a chance to sabotage Red Eye’s efforts if war breaks out. It would be easy enough to rig the materials We give him with small explosives, set to explode at a moment of Our choosing.  "
