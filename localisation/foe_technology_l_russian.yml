 ###Expanded Industry Tech###
 
 extraction_industry_tech_4_2:0 "Soundwave-Extraction"
 extraction_industry_tech_4_2_desc:0 "Utilizing ground Sonar to locate deposites, or scout out Scavenging sites will speed up the process a lot. Additionally, dedicated Sound-Bays are able to use super-low frequencies to pulverize certain materials, while leaving others unharmed, making extraction childs play."
 
 construction_industry_tech_4_2:0 "Glass and Steel"
 construction_industry_tech_4_2_desc:0 "While certainly not the most aesthetically pleasing, we have an abundance of Steel, and glass is pretty simple to manufacture. Not being reliant on time-consuming bricks will certainly make construction easier, but this should only be a temporary solution, until we come up with some less labour-intensive methods."
 
 habitation_industry_tech_4_2:0 "Military Construction"
 habitation_industry_tech_4_2_desc:0 "While not totally comfortable, the Military of the Wartime devised several easy and quick ways to mass-manufacture housing to combat those houses lost in Airraids. we will study their methods and modify them to be of use in our own projects."
 
 maketool_engineering_7:0 "Arcano-Mechanical Tools"
 maketool_engineering_7_desc:0 "Powered tools are nice, but what about tools that do most of the work by themselves? These Arcano-Mechanical constructs dynamically adapt themselves to whatever situation they are encountering, changing size, shape and hardness as need be. With this, a single universal tool can fulfill the tasks we'd needed a dozen others before."
 
 universal_industry_tech_cap:0 "Atomic-Rearrangement Process"
 universal_industry_tech_cap_desc:0 "By using extremely advanced Spell-Matrices and ludicrous amounts of energy, we are able to very literally re-arrange objects on the atomic scale, transumuting base elements into one another like lesser civilizations thought impossible before. Truly this is the Cutting edge of Production."

 extraction_industry_tech_6:0 "Matrix-powered Alchemy"
 extraction_industry_tech_6_desc:0 "Utilizing the latest advances in Spell-Matrix research, we are able to pinpoint imperfections in our production and extraction processes, and use targeted Alchemy to transmute the faults into usable material. No longer will a single piece of Metal, or a defunc Circuitboard need to be thrown away!"

 construction_industry_tech_7:0 "Arcane Materials"
 construction_industry_tech_7_desc:0 "Naturally, materials that are physically impossible in our world, could theoretically be much more resillient and easier to work with thant even our best Composites. Using Arcane-Reallity-Simulation, combined with cutting-edge summoning spells, allows us to literally pull such impossible materials from the Ether and into our World."

 agriculture_industry_tech_8:0 "Self-Improving Crops"
 agriculture_industry_tech_8_desc:0 "By imbuing an AI-spellmatrix with the ability to magically modify our crops as neccessary, we have essentially moved past genecrops and entered a world where our Crops will grow better and better each year, without our intervention. Lets hope a "Crop Singularity" isn't a thing to worry about..."
