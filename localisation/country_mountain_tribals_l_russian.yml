This box is the holy beacon through which the Spirits communicate with the mortal realm, sharing the words and wisdom of the Moon above.\n \n[Root.GetLeader] continues to sit still and wait. The Spirits will come in time, as they always have and always shall. Suddenly, with a crackle and a flicker, the Spirits begin to speak in their inpony voices. \n \n'...wel...joy...Luna...spread harmony throughout the land!'. With a final crackle, the Spirits fall silent. A moment later and the lone pony would stand up, confident in what their purpose in this world is."

 GRV_event.2.t:0 "The Voice in the Dark"
 GRV_event.2.d:0 "A pony sits alone in the center of the so-called 'Wind-Park'. Windmills rise far into the air around her, harvesting the energy of the wind and providing for the ponies of Green Valley. The wind roars through the air, which the lesser minded could misintepret as something mystical. Thankfully, Spark is not a lesser pony. She wonders if this could be it, if the noise of the wind produces the supposed 'Spirits' that the tribe has allowed to guide them for so long. \n \n Suddenly, with a flicker and a crackle, a terminal turns on before him. Out of a speaker in desperate need of maintenance comes a computerized voice, speaking broken and distorted words. Is this it? A simple terminal? Spark's not entirely certain how she should feel in that moment. Surprised? Disappointed? It matters not, for a moment later an idea comes to her. The shaman's do not listen to Spark herself, but they hold this simple machine to be the word of their God. A machine that is little more than a tool, and that can be made to say whatever one wishes. The idea develops into a plan, and the lone pony gets to work."

Though we would of expected them to leave us in the dust, they have instead come to us with an offer: they shall share their advancements with us, and in exchange we must submit to their authority. This has of course become a highly divisive issue for the tribe."

In exchange for accepting their supreme authority, they shall be our greatest friends and offer us all sorts of technological marvels. Though we do very much enjoy such fancy technology, the likes of which our elders tell stories about from before the End of Days, we must consider this carefully."

Now, she has come to us with an offer to join them in the future. In exchange for our servitude, we shall receive all of their advancements. We could expect things to improve a lot around here, but is it really worth signing away our freedom for? And do we even know what Spark's end goals are?"

 GRV_event.7.d:0 "Travelers have been coming in from the west. They speak of the miracles of Green Valley, a land that has somehow ascended from primitive tribes to almost pre-war levels of technology. And now, this land of advancement and prospertiy has come to us with an offer: to join them in their near utopian future, or to stay behind in the arrogant past. By accepting their 'help', we would also be surrendering our rule to them, and would become part of their nation. Do we dare take such an offer?"
 GRV_event.7.a:0 "A bright future awaits us."

 FTP_event.1.t:0 "Our Old Friends Seek an Alliance"
 FTP_event.1.d:0 "We have always had a very friendly relationship with the pony pups to the east. Their childish niavity and excitement has always warmed our hearts, and we have helped ensure that they have prospered. Recently, they and their adult ponies to the south have unified into one tribe, abandoning the system that they had maintained for countless generations. This change had left us cautious, unsure of what our relationship with the pups would be now that they are no longer fully independent. \n \n So we were pleasantly surprised when a group of ponies and their pups arrived today with a request. They would like us to join their unified tribes in an alliance, to see to their safety just as they would to ours. Though many of us would love to further help those that we have looked out for over centuries, others are calling for us to express caution in dealing with them. Afterall, it isn't just the pups anymore, and grown ponies have been considerably less friendly towards us in the past."

 FTP_event.2.d:0 "The ponies of Foal-Valley have come to us with an offer. They would like our two tribes to form an alliance, so as to ensure the continued independence and defence of our region. While this would certainly help us should an outside force try to push into our land, it would also mean we would be expected to help the other tribes should the same occur to them. Should we accept?"

 WNF_event.1.t:0 "Winsome Tribe is Proposing an Alliance"
 WNF_event.1.d:0 "We haven't had many interactions with the many tribes to the west. So it was a surprise when a group of tribals arrived today bearing an offer from the Winsome Tribe. It appears they would be interested in forming an alliance between us and them, with the stated intention of dividing Mudberg's lands between us. Though Mudberg is of little real value to us, a little bit of extra land never hurt anypony. However, there's no telling what Winsome's plans for the future are. This alliance very well could end up being our downfall."
 WNF_event.1.a:0 "Accept."
 WNF_event.1.b:0 "Decline."
 
 WNF_event.2.t:0 "The Winsome Republic Reaches Out"
 WNF_event.2.d:0 "One of the pony tribes of the east have begun their conquest of the Foal Mountains. Unlike the other tribes, they claim to be fighting for the interests of the common pony, but many of their actions would imply otherwise. Perhaps most damningly, they have forcibly fought, killed, and conquered the pony pups that we once helped care for, with many of these pups fleeing into our own land. Though they've since gone about establishing a new government over Foal-Valley, their crimes during the conflict are undeniable. \n \n Now, this so-called 'republic' has come to us. They seek to have us join them in their alliance, serving their goals and interests. Popular opinion would have us tell them off in a very harsh manner. Unfortunately, we can't decide based solely on our emotions, and we are instead forced to face the simple fact that we might not be able to defeat them should they decide to invade our lands as well. And then who would look after the pups? It's a hard decision, and there doesn't appear to be any right answer."
 WNF_event.2.a:0 "Very well then. We shall work with them."
 WNF_event.2.b:0 "They can go fuck themselves with a sharpened crystal."
