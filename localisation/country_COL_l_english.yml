Unseen Spiral has been using those spells for years now, and never once has anypony complained after the spell was cast.

 COL_demobilize_militia:0 "Demobilize the Militia"
 COL_demobilize_militia_desc:0 "With the War finally over, we will have to rebuild this broken nation. This won't be possible if most of the young and fit are mobilized in the army or war-industry. Our experiments are also nearing their expiration date, and it would be wise to recall and disassemble them, to use their components for other projects."
 
 COL_reign_in_cossacks:0 "Eliminate Cossack Leadership"
 COL_reign_in_cossacks_desc:0 "The Cossacks have shown themselves to be untrustworthy, turning even upon the relatively mundane regime of Stalwart Shield. We, who are seeking to go to any extremes neccessary to drag this nation into the future, have no use for them. The Spellbound soldiers will be reorganized into Hit-Squads, which will eliminate any Cossack-Leadership that might have survived the War in one fell swoop."
 
 COL_curtail_nobles:0 "Hunt down the Nobles"
 COL_curtail_nobles_desc:0 "While we may have tolerated them during the war, the old Commonwealth Nobility no longer serves a purpose.

 COL_kucyjow_restoration_desc:0 "The revolution is too entrenched in the hearts and minds of many, to make simply rooting it out by force a slow and dangerous endeavor. Instead we will offer them a compromise now, promising reform and letting them keep some of their newfound rights. Of course, this is a ploy to erode their faith in Vermillionism in the coming years and slowly convince them of the superiority of our system."

 COL_gustav_economic_control_desc:0 "The Country and the economy lie in ruins. Thousands have died in the war, or have fled the land. Reviving the Economy seems like a near-impossible task. But there is one Griffon who thrives on such tasks: Gustav Dampffeder, Master-Engineer and Economic genius. We will give Gustav free reign to set up a recovery plan, that will hopefully restore most of what was lost in a timely manner."

Magical Crystals are created from the fossilized and compressed remains of Magical Creatures, and ponies are inherently magical like most creatures in our world. Therefore, it stands to reason, that there is a functional conversion-process from Living pony into Magically charged Crystal. We will use our expertise in magical agriculture to give this process a bit of life, creating a facsimile of the mythical tree of Harmony. Many thousands will have to die to make this a reality, but in the end we'll have a renewable source of Magical Crystlas."

 springcouncil.7.d:0 "Zirratu, you keep working in here and I'll probably forget what you used to smell like." Boiling Brew’s mild attempt at conversation surprisingly managed to pull the zebra off his work as he let down his scalpel. If her humor wasn't the one to stall him out of his diligence, it would be the brief moment of respite he knew he needed to cherish with one of his long trusted friends.\n\n"Hello, Brew."\n\nThey both briefly exchanged warm smiles, smiles that showed their long, some might even say healthy, friendship. Zirratu, however, proceeded to waste no time, and returned right back to work on the corpse, with the smile from Brew's face quickly fading as a result. Even if he means well, Brew was afraid that the zebra she grew to know over time would slowly collapse itself under the weight of untiring work.\n"You need a break, Zirratu. It'll do you good, trust me." She eyed her friend, still tending to the corpse of some clearly long dead pony. For too long she associated her friend with fiddling around with his necromantic work. As she pondered, she slowly trotted around the room, trying to decipher the purpose of what was probably hours upon hours of work, if not more. The Corpses skin looked too stretchy, like it was rubber and not hide, and bulges at the back, neck and each knee suggested the spine and joints had been reinforced in some manner. She shivered, the room being kept just above freezing to stay the decay in a very mundane way, for a place of so much magic as the Limuan Academy. He clearly needed a break, for his mental health, and to prevent him from getting forstbite again. Zirratu sighed as he turned back towards her. Just as Brew knew what made the zebra tick, Zirratu knew the pony alchemist as well. From the moment she stepped in, he knew why she'd come to visit him. He also very much knew how much he needed to keep working, the new, stronger Undead Soldiers needed to be ready for his lecture tomorrow.\n"I have no time for breaks, Brew, not anymore. All of this work, not to mention, making sure my disciples get their work done correctly and efficiently... it takes all the time I have. I can't."\nFor a moment, Brew frowned pausing, letting Zirratu continue working before her face lit up, and idea quickly forming. "Well," she replied, "You could... lend disciples to me. Ease some load off your back." \n\nThe comment made Zirratu pause for once, and he turned around to look at her once more. Before he could say anything, she quickly added:\n"I don't even need to take em' all, just the troublesome ones that are giving you a hard time." She coated her request with one of her signature winning smiles. "They could even assist me in trying out my newest potions, I've been needing more magically savy testers for a while now anyway." She walked up to him and placed a hoof on his shoulder. "Hey, I'll even make sure not to give them the potions I feed the radbunnies... or the Prisoners"\nNow a smile came even to dilligent Zirratu.\nHe really ought to spend some more time with his friends, he knew she had a point. With a little chuckle of his own he said:"

 springcouncil.10.t:0 "History Lessons"
 springcouncil.10.d:0 "-and you youngsters would never be able to the world of before, before all this unnecessary change happened. 'Peaceful' isn't strong enough of a word to describe how your Equestria was back then. No, not even. Let me tell you, the concept of looking out of one another? Such a part of our lives we never paid much attention to the concept. We never had to worry about the treacherous qualities we fear in each other now. Now, life wasn't that easy, but it was certainly less stressful than whatever times these balefire bombs have brought us. I'm sure you've heard all the stories from your parents, about what it was probably like when they were fillies, before the war even." Sick Shine paused for effect. "It's true! We lived in peace and harmony! And it was quite good, a better time for sure." He listens to the very brief silence that followed his words with an amused smile. He knew that no one would ever believe this raspy voice through the radio, yet he continued.\n\n"Now, I know what you're thinking: 'How can anyone say that?' Oh, no war? No worries? Let me tell you, every word you hear about the Equestria of old is true. It was changeless, and that's what made it ideal. The worst we had to fear only came up in uh, unlucky coincidences or... sheer accidents, not worrying if you would be able to fend off the next batch of raiders. Sure, there were some bad apples here and there, but nothing compared to today. That's why I'll always remember those days fondly. They weren't perfect, mind you, but at least things were... calm. You couldn't really get caught up in any petty arguments, because you knew the pony at the other end of the table never really meant it at the end of the day. You don't see those shining qualities in others anymore..." Sick Shine trailed off into silence.\n\nFor once, it would seem his own words had an impact on him. As unprofessional as it was to let dead air soak up the radio, it would seem the ghoul had perhaps focused too much on what he wanted to say. A sort of awkward gloom filled the room, at least until he cocked a weak smile.\n\n"I'll tell you one good thing these bombs have brought us, this precious radiation! Something I never could've realized in my many years. I don't need to eat anymore. In fact, I could probably go without food forever if I wanted to. There are plenty of ponies who'd love to trade places with me. Hey, just look-"\n\nThe noise of the door opening interrupted him as Purple Lightning strode in, his eyes rolling at the sight of the ghoul.
 springcouncil.10.a:0 "Shine, how long have you been on the radio?"
 
 springcouncil.11.t:0 "Who are you?"
 springcouncil.11.d:0 "WIP\nOne of Unseen Spirals' subordinates interrogates a pony. The whole thing should feel very kafkaesque. At the start, the pony tells him that they've had this same interrogation 4 times already, but that they hope to finally have succeeded. The pony can answer most questions quite well, seeming mentally intact, but hits a mental snag, when asked what his own name is. He starts freaking out, when further questions reveal that he doesn't remember his family either... not even if he had family, or how many. when he breaks down, Spiral enters the room, casts a spell and the pony is overcome with calm. Spiral and his underlings then discuss amongst themselves, how the experiment was a success, but that there are still some variables to fine-tune."
