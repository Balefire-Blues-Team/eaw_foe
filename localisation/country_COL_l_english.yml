 COL_experimental_army:0 "The Experimental Army"

 COL_volatile_magic_factories:0 "Prototype Magical Factories"
 COL_volatile_magic_factories_desc:0 "Dampffeder's pet project, these partially-autonomous factories can function with less workers, and less materials. Since they are still early prototypes, worker deaths are common, and they are horribly polluting, which doesn't earn us any favour with the Civillian populace."
 
 COL_resistance_against_council:0 "Resistance against the Council"
 COL_resistance_against_council_desc:0 "Since the Council of Spring deposed the civilian government, many citizens have taken it upon themselves to oppose us at any opportunity. They are no real threat, but still a nusiance, and should be dealt with swiftly."
