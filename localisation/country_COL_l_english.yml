 COL_find_willing_subjects_desc:0 "Most ponies are irrationally afraid of being §rMind-controlled§!, feeling that it is a violation of their very self. Unseen Spiral has been using those spells for years now, and never once has anypony complained after the spell was cast. In fact, they all seemed quite happy with their new Situation.\nIf we just forcefully aquire some subjects, I'm sure they'll see the error of their ways, after they have been §rAligned§!"
 
 COL_control_troublemakers:0 "Teach the Troublemakers"
 COL_control_troublemakers_desc:0 "Many of the Civilians still bristle at our rule, and seek to undermine us at every opportunity. Most ponies are too passive to take any real action, but some troublemakers rile them up.

Now, the rest of the Council has convinced him that these little experiments are needed for the war effort, and these wonderful guns are being handed out to our soldiers.

 COL_demobilize_militia:0 "Demobilize the Militia"
 COL_demobilize_militia_desc:0 "With the War finally over, we will have to rebuild this broken nation. This won't be possible if most of the young and fit are mobilized in the army or war-industry. Our experiments are also nearing their expiration date, and it would be wise to recall and disassemble them, to use their components for other projects."
 
 COL_reign_in_cossacks:0 "Eliminate Cossack Leadership"
 COL_reign_in_cossacks_desc:0 "The Cossacks have shown themselves to be untrustworthy, turning even upon the relatively mundane regime of Stalwart Shield. We, who are seeking to go to any extremes neccessary to drag this nation into the future, have no use for them. The Spellbound soldiers will be reorganized into Hit-Squads, which will eliminate any Cossack-Leadership that might have survived the War in one fell swoop."
 
 COL_curtail_nobles:0 "Hunt down the Nobles"
 COL_curtail_nobles_desc:0 "While we may have tolerated them during the war, the old Commonwealth Nobility no longer serves a purpose. Untiring Hunter-Killer Squads of Robots and Undead Constructs will be dispatched to scour the land and identify, catch and, if neccessary, eliminate any noblepony they can find.

 COL_kucyjow_restoration:0 "The Kucykowy Compromise"
 COL_kucyjow_restoration_desc:0 "The revolution is too entrenched in the hearts and minds of many, to make simply rooting it out by force a slow and dangerous endeavor. Instead we will offer them a compromise now, promising reform and letting them keep some of their newfound rights. Of course, this is a ploy to erode their faith in Vermillionism in the coming years and slowly convince them of the superiority of our system."
 
 COL_gustav_economic_control:0 "Put Gustav in Charge of rebuilding the Economy."
 COL_gustav_economic_control_desc:0 "The Country and the economy lie in ruins. Thousands have died in the war, or have fled the land. Reviving the Economy seems like a near-impossible task. But there is one Griffon who thrives on such tasks: Gustav Dampffeder, Master-Engineer and Economic genius. We will give Gustav free reign to set up a recovery plan, that will hopefully restore most of what was lost in a timely manner."

 COL_align_key_figures_desc:0 "To stabilize our Country, and lend more legitimacy to our Regime, Unseen Spiral will use his Hypnotic Magic to 'Align' key figures that hold positions of importance in society.

 COL_back_on_track_desc:0 "Our Lands have been pacified, our enemies are either dead, in exile, or in our Control, soon to be aligned.

At certain intervalls, these 'White-Raods' will have little Bone-white Huts with skeletons insede them placed along them. These will be in charge of perputally repairing the roads."

Magical Crystals are created from the fossilized and compressed remains of Magical Creatures, and ponies are inherently magical like most creatures in our world. Therefore, it stands to reason, that there is a functional conversion-process from Living pony into Magically charged Crystal. We will use our expertise in magical agriculture to give this process a bit of life, creating a facsimile of the mythical tree of Harmony. Many thousands will have to die to make this a reality, but in the end we'll have a renewable source of Magical Crystlas."

Normally this would be a Necromancer, however with our new Undead Constructs, we were able to instead embed a charged spellmatrix within the body of these constructs, which can power them autonomously for weeks on end, before needing to be recharged. Due to these cores being rather bulky, as large as the average head, and quite fragile, these new generation constructs had to be designed a lot larger than our usual warriors. Multiple spines had to be bolted together to support the structure, ribs were interwoven to seal the ribcage, and provide armour for the matrix, and multiple sets of limbs were attached to the elongated Spine to make locomotion possible, and increase their combat-effectiveness."

 springcouncil.3.d:0 "Blasted device, what will get you to- oh!"\n\nThe elderly voice through the radio brims with joy as he realizes that he is now on air.\n\n"Fellow citizens of the Commonwealth! I come to you through electromagnetic waves with provocative news!\n\nI am Doctor Error! Scientist, teacher, and as of recently, your new leader! During these turbulent times, I bring you this message directly from the Cobalt Tower. This must be a curious time for all of you, quite surely. The news on what has transpired recently may have already spread across the Commonwealth and into each one of your worn out ears. With this information, you may have heard of these 'opposing' leaders that seek to now befall us, the very ones that wish to bring you progress. But they are unfit to carry forward this, er, spirit of development! That is why I, Doctor Error, now vocalize this very message towards all of you! Indeed, I can safely consider most of the previous hindrances in my plans OBSOLETE!\n\nYes indeed! No restrictions or rules to impede us now! No... only the art of science! A society built solely for PROGRESS!"\n\nThe loudness of the Robobrain's voice erupted through the radio, causing the static to peak.\n\n"I and all those under my tutelage shall begin our journey towards a better, smarter, and more advanced Wasteland! A more splendid one, filled with science on the levels no one has ever seen! For without any archaic rules to now hinder us, nothing stops us now from doing pushing the boundary that defines greatness!\n\nSo do not fret, for the past may have been woefully primitive, nothing but brightness awaits you in all of your futures, for it will be I and the rest of my students that will help get you there.\n\nAh, my dear students... each of you a definitive representation of the elements that embody us all..."\n\nFor once during this broadcast, the voice begins to quite down, as if it were relishing in its own thoughts for a moment.\n\n"You will bring untold greatness to this Wasteland, I know of it."

 springcouncil.6.t:0 "History Lesson"
 springcouncil.6.d:0 "The air outside the school brimmed with the smell of death. The sounds of one pony could still be heard as the rasp in his voice echoed through the halls.\\n\\n"And the government, these 'ministries' others would call them. Please! They were apparently made for the war effort, but I say otherwise. I've seen what harm they've done! These six ministries, along with the ministry mares, pathetic excuses of ponies to carry the Elements. What use did the Ministry of Wartime Technology bring? The Ministry of Image? Magic? Peace? NOTHING! The Princesses were fine on their own! It was those pathetic traitors that brought doom on us all. Pinkie Pie? Twilight? Rainbow Dash? All six of them. They brought nuclear annihilation to us all. And you know who else? That horrid little Fluttershy. She was the worst of the lot. She was the one that caused the war, the one that started it. The traitor deserved to go down in these flames, but now her legacy is carried on as a hero. Pathetic.\\n\\nYou're all here to learn the truth. It was those mares that started this whole mess. They claimed to be trying to solve the war, make peace with the zebras while working with our pathetic government at the time. Look what good they did. This used to be a land where ponies could smile and laugh and sing and dance and play. Now it's nothing but. The Princesses of course knew otherwise, but the repercussions on stopping them would prove too costly. Too dangerous. So, our Princesses did what they could to try to remedy the situation, but it wasn't enough. The damage was already done. Now, we're stuck with a ruined Equestria filled with fallout. A wasteland. There's even those who now claim that the Elements are gone.\\n\\nBut don't worry. I'll show you how to survive. How to make your way through the wastes. How to not only survive, but thrive. We will evolve and learn to not repeat the mistakes of the past!"\\n\\nNo words came from his chained audience, only the sounds of gargling and throats rasping against the air, for all they could do was emit these foul noises. Even if this passionate lesson was told from the only sentient creature in the building, Sick Shine seemed to fit in perfectly among his peers."
 springcouncil.6.a:0 "Preaching to a macabre choir."
 
 springcouncil.7.t:0 "Taking A Load Off"
 springcouncil.7.d:0 "Zirratu, you keep working in here and I'll probably forget what you used to smell like." Boiling Brew’s mild attempt at conversation surprisingly managed to pull the zebra off his work as he let down his scalpel. If her humor wasn't the one to stall him out of his diligence, it would be the brief moment of respite he knew he needed to cherish with one of his long trusted friends.\n\n"Hello, Brew."\n\nThey both briefly exchanged warm smiles, smiles that showed their long, some might even say healthy, friendship. Zirratu, however, proceeded to waste no time, and returned right back to work on the corpse, with the smile from Brew's face quickly fading as a result. Even if he means well, Brew was afraid that the zebra she grew to know over time would slowly collapse itself under the weight of untiring work.\n"You need a break, Zirratu. It'll do you good, trust me." She eyed her friend, still tending to the corpse of some clearly long dead pony. For too long she associated her friend with fiddling around with his necromantic work. As she pondered, she slowly trotted around the room, trying to decipher the purpose of what was probably hours upon hours of work, if not more. The Corpses skin looked too stretchy, like it was rubber and not hide, and bulges at the back, neck and each knee suggested the spine and joints had been reinforced in some manner. She shivered, the room being kept just above freezing to stay the decay in a very mundane way, for a place of so much magic as the Limuan Academy. He clearly needed a break, for his mental health, and to prevent him from getting forstbite again. Zirratu sighed as he turned back towards her. Just as Brew knew what made the zebra tick, Zirratu knew the pony alchemist as well. From the moment she stepped in, he knew why she'd come to visit him. He also very much knew how much he needed to keep working, the new, stronger Undead Soldiers needed to be ready for his lecture tomorrow.\n"I have no time for breaks, Brew, not anymore. All of this work, not to mention, making sure my disciples get their work done correctly and efficiently... it takes all the time I have. I can't."\nFor a moment, Brew frowned pausing, letting Zirratu continue working before her face lit up, and idea quickly forming. "Well," she replied, "You could... lend disciples to me. Ease some load off your back." \n\nThe comment made Zirratu pause for once, and he turned around to look at her once more. Before he could say anything, she quickly added:\n"I don't even need to take em' all, just the troublesome ones that are giving you a hard time." She coated her request with one of her signature winning smiles. "They could even assist me in trying out my newest potions, I've been needing more magically savy testers for a while now anyway." She walked up to him and placed a hoof on his shoulder. "Hey, I'll even make sure not to give them the potions I feed the radbunnies... or the Prisoners"\nNow a smile came even to dilligent Zirratu.\nHe really ought to spend some more time with his friends, he knew she had a point. With a little chuckle of his own he said:"
 springcouncil.7.a:0 "I want their personalities intact when you're done with them."
 
 springcouncil.8.t:0 "Bricks, mortar and an uncertain Future"
 springcouncil.8.d:0 "WIP\nPonies are rebuilding, and getting their lives back in order, but the new government is scary, and nopony is entirely sure what the future holds."
 springcouncil.8.a:0 "We have a long way to go."
 
 springcouncil.9.t:0 "Arcane-Cryptoeconomics and other Party-Chatter"
 springcouncil.9.d:0 "WIP\nGustav indulges in some light chems at a party at the Alchemy department, while explaining the fun topic of Arcane-Cryptoeconomics to Purple Lightning, who is listening, and Unseen Spiral, who is clearly very bored."
 springcouncil.9.a:0 "Have you heard about the Gralangé effect?"
 
 springcouncil.10.t:0 "History Lessons"
 springcouncil.10.d:0 "-and you youngsters would never be able to the world of before, before all this unnecessary change happened. 'Peaceful' isn't strong enough of a word to describe how your Equestria was back then. No, not even. Let me tell you, the concept of looking out of one another? Such a part of our lives we never paid much attention to the concept. We never had to worry about the treacherous qualities we fear in each other now. Now, life wasn't that easy, but it was certainly less stressful than whatever times these balefire bombs have brought us. I'm sure you've heard all the stories from your parents, about what it was probably like when they were fillies, before the war even." Sick Shine paused for effect. "It's true! We lived in peace and harmony! And it was quite good, a better time for sure." He listens to the very brief silence that followed his words with an amused smile. He knew that no one would ever believe this raspy voice through the radio, yet he continued.\n\n"Now, I know what you're thinking: 'How can anyone say that?' Oh, no war? No worries? Let me tell you, every word you hear about the Equestria of old is true. It was changeless, and that's what made it ideal. The worst we had to fear only came up in uh, unlucky coincidences or... sheer accidents, not worrying if you would be able to fend off the next batch of raiders. Sure, there were some bad apples here and there, but nothing compared to today. That's why I'll always remember those days fondly. They weren't perfect, mind you, but at least things were... calm. You couldn't really get caught up in any petty arguments, because you knew the pony at the other end of the table never really meant it at the end of the day. You don't see those shining qualities in others anymore..." Sick Shine trailed off into silence.\n\nFor once, it would seem his own words had an impact on him. As unprofessional as it was to let dead air soak up the radio, it would seem the ghoul had perhaps focused too much on what he wanted to say. A sort of awkward gloom filled the room, at least until he cocked a weak smile.\n\n"I'll tell you one good thing these bombs have brought us, this precious radiation! Something I never could've realized in my many years. I don't need to eat anymore. In fact, I could probably go without food forever if I wanted to. There are plenty of ponies who'd love to trade places with me. Hey, just look-"\n\nThe noise of the door opening interrupted him as Purple Lightning strode in, his eyes rolling at the sight of the ghoul.
 springcouncil.10.a:0 "Shine, how long have you been on the radio?"
 
 springcouncil.11.t:0 "Who are you?"
 springcouncil.11.d:0 "Light. A blinding, yet enlightening beam of rays punctured the stallion's eye.\n"What stallion?", the stallion thought. "Am I the stallion?"\n"You are the stallion.", a seemingly friendly mare said. "My friend, it seems as though we have had this same interrogation about, hm, four times?" She looked off in the distance as if she was speaking to someone else, but there was no one else. Just the mare and the stallion.\n"Why am I here? And who are you, exactly? I haven't gotten your name," the seemingly less dazed stallion asked. "I am no one. But you do know me. You may not recognize me now, but you do know me. And I know you, all too well."\nThe stallion had a blank stare, until his body inevitably forced him to blink. In doing so, the mare disappeared from his line of sight. Then, not even a second later, a voice came from behind. "Please pay attention, your lack of observative ability is highly infuriating. Now do sit down." The stallion sat down without a word. "How did I sit down?", the stallion then thought. "There is no chair, nor table," without realizing the chair he was sitting on, and the table in front of him. The mare in front of him, now bearing the apparel of a Smoerbotti Cossack, and the wings of a grand pegasus, asked him simple questions.\n\n"What is 2+2?", she asked.\n\n"4," the stallion replied.\n\n"How many fingers am I holding up?"\n\n"What are fingers?"\n\nGood. Now, what is your name?"\n"My name? My name is Bob, no, Gunther, no, Apple Pie! No, Tiny Lock! What is your name? I think you know your name but you refuse to tell me mine! You do not know me, I don't know you! You liar! I remember my name, but it ceases to exist in my brain. Why is this damnable light so bright?!"\n"How's your family life?"\n"You took my family! My wife and three children! Or, was it two? I think I had two little fillies and a colt? Did I have children? I think my dear wife had only miscarriages. I think. She might've eaten them, we were quite hungry. Did I have a wife? My mother? I don't believe I had one. Or a family. I might've. But I remember many other families at the same time. You look like my sister. Or someone else's sister. Damnit, where are you Cynthia? My beloved! Please come back to me!"\n\nAs soon as the stallion began to act up, Spiral entered the room of white and casted a spell of calm onto the pony. As quickly as the rage came in, it vented out just as swiftly. "Have you heard about the griffons? I hear they're quite the greedy folk."\nThe now plainly clothed mare rose from her seat and began to converse with Unseen Spiral and his aids. "The experiment was quite successful. The subject showed most of the expected signs to come, and in terms of last time, this was a major victory. In terms of the ultimate goal, however, there are still quirks to be fixed. That is of no matter, though. We shall fine tune it, in a soon or later date. The former, hopefully."
 springcouncil.11.a:0 "As that's left is polishing, and a few broken minds."
 
 springcouncil.12.t:0 "Dreams of the Sky"
 springcouncil.12.d:0 "Purple Lightning sulks in solitude, residing in a cold and utterly dull office. It was clean. Especially clean, by wasteland standards. The floor didn't hurt his hooves when he walked, and when he looked out the sky, it wasn't an awfully tainted green that emphasized the destroyed world he was in. But, it just wasn't the same.\n\nThe pegasus was a Dashite. A pony who deserted the Grand Pegasus Enclave, in the name of their namesake, Rainbow Dash, who vowed under an oath of loyalty to aid post-war Equestria. Something that didn't fly with the cloud cities, who cowardly fled their posts in order to save themselves from the destruction. They abandoned their country, and people. They were the biggest bastards in this world, Purple Lightning told himself. Yet, he couldn't help but think about the good times he had up in the sky.\n\nUp in the cloud cities, he had his own office, similar to now, but so much better. The sky was always clear, and one could always see the sun. A rarity down here. The floors not only were clean, they were clouds. Soft as a cloud! Literally! The rooms were hardly ever dull, with their splendidly bright colors, exotic architecture, and overly dramatic lighting, which Purple Lightning couldn't help but miss especially. And the part he missed the most. The freedom. Freedom of what kind of equipment he could work on, whether it be the constantly updated power armor models, energy weaponry, Raptor components, the lot of it. Then, the freedom to choose. The Enclave cities weren't centralized under one strongman or monarch, like the Equestria of old, but were rather of loose confederation of cloud cities. Ones that could choose their own leaders. It was a paradise.\n\nA paradise for the weak and selfish.\n\nPurple Lightning was not weak, nor selfish. He had a duty to serve his country, a country which had been betrayed by his own people in the Enclave. In all sense of the word, they were traitors. He was not. And so he deserted. No matter how rough his currency situation is, he was making the world a better place down here, rather than up there.\n\nAnd so, he sighed, and returned to his duty. Surely, this new Cloudbreaker Bomb blueprint will impress the council.""

 springcouncil.18.a:0 "So it shall be"
 
 springcouncil.19.t:0 "Monolyths to Eternity"
 springcouncil.19.d:0 "Concrete Slab wore a grim expression on her face, as she observed the undead set down brick after brick of the eerily smooth black stone.\nThe Monolyth already reached well over three stories, and once it was completed, it would be over 5 stories tall, the tallest construction in Fleethoof. Once the Undead were finished with one section, a group of Slabs workers would come over and seal the stone with the liquid sent to them from Limua. They had to wear gasmasks for its toxicity, but the end-effect was truly something to behold:\nAs it dried, the liquid seemed to soak up the light in its immediate vicinity, giving one the feeling of staring stright in the abyss when looking straight at it.\nThe effect also seemed to gain in strength when exposed to more light, causing the darkness to spread. This resulted in the tower always having 2 shadows: The normal one, away from the sun, and a second, nearly black one, that stretched towards the sun, as if trying to reach and devour it.\nConcrete Slab suppressed a shudder.\nShe would be happy to have this project behind her, and to never again have to see one of these monolyths.\nThe ponies of Fleethoof however, as well as every other major town within the territories of the Acolytes and Detrot, would forever have to live in the metaphorical, as well as the literal shadow of this thing.\nThey would always be reminded of their betrayal of the Commonwealth, and of their failiure to stop the madponies that ruled their nations."
 springcouncil.19.a:0 "An eternal Reminder."
 
 springcouncil.20.t:0 "The Future of Necromancy"
 springcouncil.20.d:0 "Truly, Necromancy is a primordial art.\nThe ancient Zebra shamans were the first to master it, using it mainly for ritualistic purposes.\nOf course, over the millenia since its discovery, many great strides were made in the field. This author could talk for hours about the Zeonician Boneguard, the invention of multithreaded channeling, or the first sucessful attempts at programming the use of Firearms into the undead.\n\nBut that is not what this text is for.\n\nInstead, let me paint you a picture of how I, and my friends in the Council of Spring envision the Necromancy of the Future:\n\nFor many of you dear readers, Necromancy may still seem foreign and 'unholy', but I assure you, it is a magical Science just as rational and predictable like your laser-rifle or the magical preservation that keeps your food edible. We will strive to educate our Citizens better on this topic, and even intend to open up lecture at the Academy of Necromantic Sciences to the general public.\nA undead is nothing to be feared. In the future, we will use them very much like a fleshy form of Robot. They will be our servants, if not domestically, then at least societally.\nA purpose-built undead construct is ideal for repetetive or dangerous tasks that a normal pony would not want to do.\nThey can work the factory lines, sweep the streets, act as auxiliary construction-workers and clear out the many hazards our forbears have left us with after their little megaspell-apocalypse.\nOne thing that may also interest many of you: They will be our soldiers of the future!\nWe intent to abolish the old conscription system, and instead found a 100%* volunteer army. These volunteers would be supported by purpose-built undead constructs, as well as general-labour-undead that can be pulled from the farms and factories, reprogrammed and sent to the Frontline.\n\nAs you can see, the undead are about to make your lives a whole lot easier!\n\nIf you would like to learn more, visit your local branch of the propaganda-department, or take one of the Flyers available for free at any police station, or Undead-warehouse."

 springcouncil.36.d:0 "The Ponies on the tables writhed in agony\n\nEvery time one of them broke a limb in their thrashing, or ripped their own skin, Boiling Brew cringed in sympathy.\nThis was ugly work, even by her standards, and she had made potions that dissolved ponies from the inside out.\nIn the end this would all be for the better, she had to believe that. Through the war, and the all the new weapons she had to make to win it, she felt like she had lost a part of the pony who started all this, the mare who would rather make ponies smile and laugh, than to see them crying blood in a mist of toxic potions.\n\nToday, that mare would return, and it would be through the blood and pain of these ponies on the tables. One last, ugly work of science, and in its horribleness, she would destroy the last part of her that cherished the laughter, the love and the harmony. But, like a Pheonix, her old self would return, for only those willing to burn themselves could become the ashes from which they shall be reborn.\nMinutes later, the last pony on the tables ceased moving, their wounds knitting themselves together, their  bones mending violently in bursts of golden fire.\nBoiling looked upon them with sunken eyes, and for the first time in what felt like forever unclenched her jaw, and smiled.\nA wide smile, quickly turning into a coughin chuckle, and then a fit of laughter so violent, her assistents worried she had taken one of the experimental drugs.\n\nNo, this was simple the exhiliration of ultimate Success!\nThere they were, her new breed of Pony, standing three hooves taller than even her tallest assistant, some of the potions rippling under their skin like a thousand worms crawling through their veins.\nThis was what she had sought! There was more truth, more wisdom in the art of alchemy than in any philosophy.\nAnd this singular truth told of the enhancement of the Self, the attainment of the Self-embodyment of Perfection!\n\nOh, how glorious a day this was, she felt her mind soaring, her thoughts racing, as she entered the room, and her new soldiers smiled at her with their new, sharp teeth, their eyes a uniform gold, and yet more alive than those of any pony she had ever met.\n\nBut\nThis was not the end... She could do SO much more\nAnd so she set to Work..."

 springcouncil.37.t:0 "Harmonic Convergence"
 springcouncil.37.d:0 "A sudden Cold washed over the Broken Plains, as uncounted Gigajoules of energy were drawn in by possibly the biggest feat of magic since the Apocalypse.\nThe spell drew on everything, ambient magic, spirits, the souls of the dead, and even the heat in the air, to power itself.\n\nIf one were to look at it from far above, through the cloud layer, you would see it converging like a massive, twisting spiral, centered in Limua.\nCentered in the specially constructed Spell-chamber, that currently housed only six creatures and a truly vast array of machinery and spell-matrices.\n\nAs the howling and crackling of energies reached its crescendo, Boiling Brew could feel her heart stop beating.\nShe didn't worry, this was an expected part of the process:\nIn order to imitate the legendary Elements of Harmony, their bodies would need to change. Right now, six hearts were crystallizing into a close imitation of the Gems that made up the elements. Around those crystal cores, their bodies were changing, new organs, cybernetics and spell-cores being seamlessly integrated into the old flesh.\n\nWhen the Energies finally subsided, Brew sat up... No, she willed herself to be upright, and telekinesis from one of the cores immediatly made it happen, no muscle was moved.\n\nAs she looked upon her friends, she could still somewhat make out their prior forms, mainly by coat-color. All of them had changed so much, and yet they were more themselves than ever.\n\nThe Elements of Harmony had returned to the World, and they would be kind Gods to the suffering Wasteland."

We need to break the ancient patterns that define our very nature, and put a stop to Entropy, to Chaos and to Discord.\n\nOur World should be one where every question has an answer and even the base Chaos of the mind is bound by concrete laws.\n\nBefore we can change the world in such a matter, we will have to change ourselves.\nIn order to combat this Entropic Terror plaguing our minds, we have two options at our Disposal:\n\nOption 1 is to enforce a strict regimen of self-betterment on our citizens, providing them medication and training where neccessary so that they may conquer their own nature, and achive their own personal Harmony.\n\nOption 2 would be to simply force alteration upon all, altering their minds with magic and their bodies with potions and cybernetics in order to make them simply incapable of non-harmonious thought or action."
