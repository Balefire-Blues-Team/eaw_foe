 COL_find_willing_subjects_desc:0 "Most ponies are irrationally afraid of being §rMind-controlled§!, feeling that it is a violation of their very self. Unseen Spiral has been using those spells for years now, and never once has anypony complained after the spell was cast. In fact, they all seemed quite happy with their new Situation.\nIf we just forcefully aquire some subjects, I'm sure they'll see the error of their ways, after they have been §rAligned§!"
 
 COL_control_troublemakers:0 "Teach the Troublemakers"
 COL_control_troublemakers_desc:0 "Many of the Civilians still bristle at our rule, and seek to undermine us at every opportunity. Most ponies are too passive to take any real action, but some troublemakers rile them up. We will capture and §ralign§! these troublemakers, and then release them back into the Population, to spread their new Insights to their fellow Citizens."

Now, the rest of the Council has convinced him that these little experiments are needed for the war effort, and these wonderful guns are being handed out to our soldiers. Whether they work or not, we will surely gather a lot of data from this Mass Field-test."

 COL_demobilize_militia:0 "Demobilize the Militia"
 COL_demobilize_militia_desc:0 "With the War finally over, we will have to rebuild this broken nation. This won't be possible if most of the young and fit are mobilized in the army or war-industry. Our experiments are also nearing their expiration date, and it would be wise to recall and disassemble them, to use their components for other projects."
 
 COL_reign_in_cossacks:0 "Eliminate Cossack Leadership"
 COL_reign_in_cossacks_desc:0 "The Cossacks have shown themselves to be untrustworthy, turning even upon the relatively mundane regime of Stalwart Shield. We, who are seeking to go to any extremes neccessary to drag this nation into the future, have no use for them. The Spellbound soldiers will be reorganized into Hit-Squads, which will eliminate any Cossack-Leadership that might have survived the War in one fell swoop."
 
 COL_curtail_nobles:0 "Hunt down the Nobles"
 COL_curtail_nobles_desc:0 "While we may have tolerated them during the war, the old Commonwealth Nobility no longer serves a purpose. Untiring Hunter-Killer Squads of Robots and Undead Constructs will be dispatched to scour the land and identify, catch and, if neccessary, eliminate any noblepony they can find. A select list who are also generals, scientists or industrialists are to be captured alive and delivered to Unseen Spiral for processing."
 
 COL_kucyjow_restoration:0 "The Kucykowy Compromise"
 COL_kucyjow_restoration_desc:0 "The revolution is too entrenched in the hearts and minds of many, to make simply rooting it out by force a slow and dangerous endeavor. Instead we will offer them a compromise now, promising reform and letting them keep some of their newfound rights. Of course, this is a ploy to erode their faith in Vermillionism in the coming years and slowly convince them of the superiority of our system."
 
 COL_gustav_economic_control:0 "Put Gustav in Charge of rebuilding the Economy."
 COL_gustav_economic_control_desc:0 "The Country and the economy lie in ruins. Thousands have died in the war, or have fled the land. Reviving the Economy seems like a near-impossible task. But there is one Griffon who thrives on such tasks: Gustav Dampffeder, Master-Engineer and Economic genius. We will give Gustav free reign to set up a recovery plan, that will hopefully restore most of what was lost in a timely manner."

 COL_align_key_figures_desc:0 "To stabilize our Country, and lend more legitimacy to our Regime, Unseen Spiral will use his Hypnotic Magic to 'Align' key figures that hold positions of importance in society.

 COL_back_on_track:0 "Getting back on Track"
 COL_back_on_track_desc:0 "Our Lands have been pacified, our enemies are either dead, in exile, or in our Control, soon to be aligned.

At certain intervalls, these 'White-Raods' will have little Bone-white Huts with skeletons insede them placed along them. These will be in charge of perputally repairing the roads."

 COL_our_own_crystal_tree_desc:0 "It is all so simple, if you look at it from a detached perspective. Magical Crystals are created from the fossilized and compressed remains of Magical Creatures, and ponies are inherently magical like most creatures in our world. Therefore, it stands to reason, that there is a functional conversion-process from Living pony into Magically charged Crystal. We will use our expertise in magical agriculture to give this process a bit of life, creating a facsimile of the mythical tree of Harmony. Many thousands will have to die to make this a reality, but in the end we'll have a renewable source of Magical Crystlas."
