generic_law_event.1.t:0 "Profits From Chem Trade"
generic_law_event.1.d:0 "Our government doesn’t care much about the chem use, or trade, of its citizenry, except on how it can profit from the trade. Chem dealers might not be the smartest ponies in the wasteland, but they know well enough to give a cut of their trade to their local authorities, to keep them happy. The local authorities then give a cut of their cut up to those above them, and then those above them, until a small percentage of the chem trade ends up as caps in the bank of the country.\n\n It’s been a particularly good month for the chem traders, selling to citizens, soldiers, and many others, making quite the profit off of it. Lucky for us, that means now we have some more caps to spend on whatever we want. The coffers are more full than before, ready to be used as the government wishes."
generic_law_event.1.a:0 "Profits Are High"

generic_law_event.2.t:0 "Dashers Division"
generic_law_event.2.d:0 "Good news comes from the conscription centers today! There’s been a group of Dash-Heads, though they prefer to call themselves Dashers, from a small settlement who signed up for the military. Apparently this group abused Dash, a drug which speeds one up and makes them feel on top of the world, and traveled around doing quests in their local settlement. Somehow they got their hooves on some ancient swords and went around beating up bandits, saving kidnapped ponies, and helping old mares cross the streets.\n\n Apparently the Dashers, as they call themselves, decided they could do more than help in small quests around the village. So they marched themselves right up to a conscription center, with their ancient weapons, and declared a so-called oath of service to our country. While they might be a bit eccentric compared to the normal soldiers, they’re fresh and eager bodies ready to be sent to the front, and their swords are better weapons than nothing."
generic_law_event.2.a:0 "We Dashers Serve!"

generic_law_event.3.t:0 "Buck Broncos"
generic_law_event.3.d:0 "Some mixed news comes in today from a settlement within our country. One of our settlements is nearby to an abandoned factory from the war, which was filled with some robots and automatic defenses, too much effort to break into and restore. Well, a local group of young stallions and mares, who reportedly were very bored, took some Buck. Buck is a drug that allows one to feel like they’re the strongest pony in the wasteland, allowing ponies to hit a lot harder than before, and take a lot harder hits without even noticing.\n\n After taking the Buck, the group of ponies, ten in number, decided they could clear the nearby factory. So they did, they went in, and despite getting shot and heavily wounded, they managed to destroy all of the security in the factory. However, in the fight, they destroyed much of the factory, making it useless for future production. Luckily, they found a box of guns in storage from early in the war, and they dragged it before the local authority to give to the government. They all then collapsed dead as soon as the Buck wore off. At least the guns can be put to use."
generic_law_event.3.a:0 "Bucked-up situation."

generic_law_event.4.t:0 "Hydra Horrors"
generic_law_event.4.d:0 "Disturbing news comes from a small settlement on the outskirts of the country, about a new group calling themselves The Hydras. They seem to be abusers of the chem Hydra, which enhances natural regeneration and healing rates, to a staggering extent. Hydra, when used properly, can be great to help heal limbs, or broken bones, or even stop fatal wounds. However, this group doesn’t use it for any of those reasons.\n\n Reports from local authorities state that The Hydras have been driven insane by their drug use, to the point that they’ve started to self-cannibalize. According to witnesses, members of the group will take Hydra and then eat their own flesh as it regenerates, a gruesome sight for any who witness it. The settlement has tried to get them all arrested, but since there’s no laws against chem use, there’s not really anything that can be done. Unsurprisingly, the local population is not very happy about that."
generic_law_event.4.a:0 "Well, that’s horrifying!"

generic_law_event.5.t:0 "Illegal Chems Seized"
generic_law_event.5.d:0 "Chems are a poison that infects the very core of a country and rots it from within, luckily, our government knows that. When chem-heads decide they’re going to try to get away with a hit of their poison, we’re there to stop them, when dealers think they’re going to sell their venom, we’re there to stop them, and when chem makers and chem testers think they can craft their miasma to rot away our ponies, we’re there to stop them.\n\n Earlier this week, chem smugglers tried to sneak in a massive shipment of chems over our border, box upon box of Buck, Dash, Mint-Als, and every other chem one can ever imagine taking. Luckily, the smugglers had a mole, and so we were able to crack down on the smuggling attempt, arresting all smugglers and seizing their contraband. While these chems might be poison when abused, they can also serve as valuable medicine to study, so the government has distributed the seized chems to researchers and medical professionals."
generic_law_event.5.a:0 "Fascinating!"

generic_law_event.6.t:0 "Mint-Al Minders"
generic_law_event.6.d:0 "Some good news comes from the border regions of the country today. A group of five intellectuals, which is to say ponies who are able to read picture books, have apparently been using a lot of Mint-Als. Mint-Als are a chem which allows for their takers to be more perceptive, more charismatic, and more smart while under its effects, though it is highly addictive.\n\n This group of Mint-Al intellectuals, calling themselves the Minders, wrote down an amazing equation in the middle of their high, before then giving said equation to a local authority. Our eggheads are saying that apparently this equation will calculate ‘drag’ and might help develop flying vehicles, like in old Equestria."
generic_law_event.6.a:0 "Now that’s getting high!"

generic_law_event.7.t:0 "A War On Chems?"
generic_law_event.7.d:0 "Chems are an insidious poison that destroys the very foundation of society when abused by low-lives and addicts. Our country stands proud as one of the few to say no to chems, to keep them in medical offices, not in the hooves of the weak-willed and needy. However, despite our best efforts, chems still haunt our nation, clawing their way into our soldiers, our children, the very roots of the country itself.\n\n A low administrator in our country, Nihlus Nix Naught, has begun to led a campaign amongst the mayors and governors of the country. Nix has led minor protests and petitions to start what she calls the War On Chems. To ignore her calls would be costly in its own right, but this so-called war would surely be costly as well, even if it got rid of chems completely. Nix awaits our response, what do we say?"
generic_law_event.7.a:0 "Get Nix on this war"
generic_law_event.7.b:0 "We’re not going to war against chems"

generic_law_event.8.t:0 "Minorities Begin Protests"
generic_law_event.8.d:0 "Shocking news from all around the nation today, as it seems like the minority groups of the country have started protesting. Ever since Nix began our War on Chems, these minority groups have claimed unfair targeting and treatment of chem enforcement. Their rates of arrest and punishment for chem usage is higher than the majority group of our country.\n\n Nix has sometimes said troubling things about the groups that are complaining about being targeted, but then again, all chem abusers would complain to have their poison taken away from them. The protests call for an end to the War on Chems, while Nix says we must double down on these rabble-rousing addicts before they get to our children. What should we do?"
generic_law_event.8.a:0 "Double down! Protect the youth!"
generic_law_event.8.b:0 "They’re right, end this war"

generic_law_event.9.t:0 "Flankers Join Protests"
generic_law_event.9.d:0 "Horrible news comes from all across the country today, as the protests have expanded even more! A group calling themselves the Flankers, who proclaim to be anti-war and pro-equality, have joined the chem-addicted minority protestors in calling for an end to the War on Chems, and even our foreign wars. Don’t these fools see that we need these wars to become bigger and better?\n\n Nix, leader of the War on Chems, has said that these Flankers are stripe sympathizers like before the bombs fell, just like those who tried to betray Equestria, now they’re here to betray us! These tree-hugging Flankers think we’ll find greatness by sitting on our flanks and doing nothing, not to mention that they all are also addicted to chems in their own rights! This just shows that the War on Chems is working, if these are the ones who are against it, why would we ever not be for it? Double down on the war, we’ll be clean of chems yet!"
generic_law_event.9.a:0 "Double down! Send these Flankers home!"
generic_law_event.9.b:0 "This has gone too far, end the war"

generic_law_event.10.t:0 "CARE Bearers"
generic_law_event.10.d:0 "Terrible news from the protesters! Some local authorities, low level governors, mayors, and law enforcement have joined the protests! Even some soldiers from the army and some foals have been dragged into it, to protest our righteous cause! These chem addicts think that just because they whine and complain that we’ll stop, but we won’t, we won’t ever stop!\n\n Nix has come up with an idea which she calls ‘CARE’, the Chems Are Restrictive and Evil program, a test which all authorities part of our government will have to take, to prove they don’t use Chems. The CARE test will be administrated by the CARE Bearers, hoof-picked by Nix as proper authorities, and the test will make sure that every member of our administration knows about the dangers of chems. All it needs is approval."
generic_law_event.10.a:0 "Approve it!"
generic_law_event.10.b:0 "This has gone too far!"

generic_law_event.11.t:0 "The War Ends!"
generic_law_event.11.d:0 "Wonderful news! With our increasing amount of resources, we have successfully defeated chems in our country! The protests have died down, the Flankers have been dealt with, and the CARE program has ensured every level of the government knows that chems are to be rejected at all costs.\n\n Local groups, especially those ran by prohibitionists or parents, have cheered the harsh measures taken on chem use. The only bad news is that Nihlus Nix Naught has been caught fabricating evidence and using government resources improperly, which has been taken care of. She’ll enjoy rotting in the same cells as all the chem-heads."
generic_law_event.11.a:0 "We did it! We won the War on Chems!"

generic_law_event.12.t:0 "We End The War"
generic_law_event.12.d:0 "The protests against our War on Chems have been many, and after some reflection, they were right! Chems are awesome, why did we ever try and stop them from spreading? Nothing quite like getting high on a Sunday afternoon.\n\n While all of the protestors are quite happy, those who supported the War on Chems are not. Nihlus Nix Naught has fled our lands to continue the war in another land, leaving behind a scathing letter in her wake. But that doesn’t matter, all that matters is that we have won the War on Chems!"
generic_law_event.12.a:0 "By joining the side of chems!"

generic_law_event.13.t:0 "RADicalism!"
generic_law_event.13.d:0 "One of the few legalized chems in the country is the use of Rad-Away and Rad-X, meant to help with radiation in our citizens. Somehow, our citizens have concocted a mixture using Rad-Away and Rad-X mixed with Sparkle-Cola.\n\n This concoction, named Orange Drink by its users, gives users a high similar to diluted Dash usage, and is very hard to crack down on. Smugglers are taking advantage of the lack of cracking down to spread this new chem all over the country."
generic_law_event.13.a:0 "Damn"
