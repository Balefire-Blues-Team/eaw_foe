  foe_scavenge.2.title:0 "The Old World Blues"
  foe_scavenge.2.desc:0 "Our scavengers have failed to find something, spending weeks in the Wastes in pursuit of old dreams. The scavengers are so obsessed with the past they can't see the present, much less the future, for what it is. And so they wasted their times on a fools errand, for what?"
  foe_scavenge.2.a:0 "Finding nothing, they stare into the what-was, guttering and spent."

  foe_scav_flavor.1.title:0 "Like a Mouse in a Maze"
  foe_scav_flavor.1.desc:0 "\"Subject 1079, please do not attempt to damage the facility again.\" said the omnipresent computerized voice over the loudspeakers, and a single beep sounded from a collar. Quick Draw had dozed off inside a small building during her most recent hunt for valuable loot but had woken up to find herself in a completely different area with this collar strapped around her neck. The voice had informed her that \"the test had begun\". Up until now, the so-called \"test\" had appeared to be nothing more than a simple maze, but now she was stuck; As soon as she had entered this area, a door slid shut behind her, and a terminal on the wall had powered itself on.\n\nAs soon as she heard the beep from her collar, Quick Draw stopped her fruitless pounding on the door. Knowing all too well what that sound meant, she gulped and turned her attention to the terminal. The sickly green screen displayed a single line of text: §dGreetings, Subject 1079, do you wish to begin the exam portion? Y/N§!. Reaching a hoof forward, the mare entered \"§dY§!\" into the device, and a new question popped up on the screen.\n\n\"§dWho is the director of the Ministry of Wartime Technology?§!\"\n\nQuick Draw furrowed her brow for a moment, trying to remember the names of long-dead ponies before she eventually entered \"§dApplejack§!\". The terminal dinged, and another question loaded, this time a piece of basic algebra. Solving problem after problem and trivia question after trivia question, the terminal eventually went dark, and the door lifted open. Scurrying out of the room, Quick Draw wove her way through the rest of the maze, until at last, she found the exit. The voice spoke once again as she stepped out of the test, \"Congratulations, Subject 1079, please come back tomorrow for the next stage of the test.". Quick Draw ran out of the building as fast as her tired legs could carry her, never to return to that awful place.\n\nAs the noon broke the next day, a collar began to beep, and Subject 1079 was removed from the testing roster."
  foe_scav_flavor.1.a:0 "Begin the search for Subject 1080."

  foe_scav_flavor.2.title:0 "Super Times at the Super Duper Mart"
  foe_scav_flavor.2.desc:0 "Habberdash and Subtle Blip quietly together in a small ditch, as they patiently observed the large building that sat across the old, decrepit parking lot.\"Are you sure we’re going to even find anything in there?\" Habberdash asks, as he sat his binoculars down and turned to face Subtle Blip. \"That Super Duper Mart looks pretty cleaned out.\"\n\nSubtle let out a chuckle, as he loaded a fresh magazine into his rifle. \"Trust me, Habby. The information I got off that caravan pointed to an untouched Civil Defence supply cache within this very building.\"\n\nHabberdash let out a sigh, before levitating his pistol out and following Subtle Blip into the Super Duper Mart. At first glance, the store already seemed to be cleaned out of anything useful. Even many of the shelving units and counters have been removed, possibly for scrap or to be repurposed somewhere else. The more the two ponies searched around, the more apparent it became that there was nothing here. \"From the looks of it, you were most definitely scammed out of your caps.\" Habberdash said, as the two moved into the back of the store.\n\nSubtle Blip gave a nervous chuckle. \"I highly doubt that. Maybe we’re just in the wrong building.\" He said. \"Or, we’re looking in the wrong location.\"\n\nHabberdash just rolled his eyes at Subtle’s remark, as he entered the manager's office. "You seriously want me to bel-" However, before he could finish what he was saying the sound of old board breaking filled the back room, followed by a thud. \"Oooooo fuck!\" Habberdash cried out.\n\n\"Shit, Habby!\" Subtle cried out, as he ran into the office. \"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Yeah yeah, I am. Just fell through some old floor boards, that’s all\" He groans out. \"Though I hope I didn’t hurt anything too badly.\"\n\nAfter taking a moment to reorient himself and wait for Subtle to climb down to help him out, the pair of ponies turned their attention to looking around the room they had just stumbled upon. Though, it didn’t take them more than a minute to realize where they were. Sitting in front was a small sealed doorway with a faded Civil Defence sign hanging above it. \"And you thought I was scammed.\" Subtle said, giving Habberdash a wide grin."
  foe_scav_flavor.2.a:0 "Let's head back to town and grab a couple carts."

  foe_scav_flavor.3.title:0 "Tech Support"
  foe_scav_flavor.3.desc:0 "Arclight stared at the massive pre-war computer that had been dragged into his workshop. He was told that one of the scavenging teams came across it while searching through an old Robronco office complex and that they wanted to see if he could try and get it running in order to see what was on it. Now, most ponies would look at this beautiful piece of pre-war technology and not really give a molerat's ass about it, as they had better things to do than fiddle with something they most likely didn’t understand. But, for Arclight, this was right up his alley, his ability to understand technology was second to none. However, after a couple days of fiddling around with the old computer, Arclight found himself in need of some help. Help that came in the form of an old, dismantled robobrain.\n\nThe robobrain slowly powered itself back on, as Arclight had it turned off to save power. After a few minutes, the creepy mechanical iris lit up and blinked. \"§dOh great, it’s the little gremlin.§!\" The robobrain rudely remarked. \"§dBack again to ruin my chassis or are you planning to ask me another series of convoluted and downright stupid questions?§!\"\n\nArclight let out a slow and heavy sigh, as he pressed a hoof to his forehead. \"Hey DOC, glad to see you haven’t changed.\" Arclight groaned out\n\n\"§dNo thanks to you, you little gremlin. So, what have you powered me on for this time?§!\" He asked. \"§dA mathematical question? A question about the old world? Another conversation about what taxes are?§!\"\n\n"Not exactly." Arclight says, motioning over to the large pre-war computer. "I've been messing around with this old Robronco Data Storage Computer, but I still can’t figure out what’s wrong with it. All the internal components were in surprisingly good condition and the case was only slightly damaged. At this point, I am afraid I’ll have to just scrap it, because I can’t get it to turn on."\n\nDOC’s mechanical iris looked over at Arclight, before turning to face the computer. \"§dI don’t know, have you tried plugging it in? That usually works.§!\"\n\nArclight stared at him for a moment, before slowly heading around to the back of the computer. After a moment of fiddling about, Arclight was able to find the power cord, which was, to his surprise, not plugged in. \"Oh for Celestia’s sake.\" He groaned out, before taking the cord and plugging it into the nearby generator.\n\n\"§dHah, gets them every time.§!\" DOC chuckled out. \"§dNow then, plug that bad buck in and let’s see what secrets this thing holds.§!\""
  foe_scav_flavor.3.a:0 "What the hay is a JPEG?"

  foe_scav_flavor.4.title:0 "Death Trap"
  foe_scav_flavor.4.desc:0 ""Do you think we should just head back?", frowned Bright Sky, "You know, just report our recent mappings?" Velvet Rain, the leader of the scavenger party, shook her head in disagreement and shot a reassuring look at both the scared stallion as well as Springflower, the second mare in the small party. "Going back empty hoofed is just gonna disappoint them." she retorted, "Besides, look."\n\nShe pointed forward towards what looked like a group of buildings, seemingly abandoned with no recent activity near it. No mutants or other sorts of potential trouble in sight either, she thought. This could be the potential venture they've been searching for hours. With a quick nod forward, both of the other ponies followed her lead, at least until Bright Sky paused abruptly. Velvet turned around and saw a scared look from her fellow stallion. It was clear he was skeptical about going forward.\n\n"Are we sure this isn't an obvious-"\n\n"Trap?" Velvet interrupted. "We're not even that far off from town. Listen, I know this seems sketchy, and I know you're just trying to save us, but I'm telling you Bright, it's that fear in your gut that we'll all laugh at back home. Just follow my lead and we'll be fine, alright?"\n\nEven then, Velvet knew Bright Sky had a right to be wary. This wasn't her first mission scavenging, far from it, but it was her first with the potential lives of two others on the line now that she's the de facto leader of this so-called scavenging mission. As the group huddled once more and approached the small abandoned village, the smell in the air began to grow more foul with each step. Springflower and Bright Sky wheezed at the smell, covering their noses as Velvet carried on. She looked around for anything useful, but all she could spot were broken barrels and dusty crates. Scavenging the only noticeable street briefly ended in failure as the stench grew worse. Such a disgusting smell, Velvet thought, yet a smell she was practically forced to inhale if she wanted to keep forward. Inhaling the stench only made her think of a possible culprit... and one she hated to think about."
  foe_scav_flavor.4.a:0 "Miasma."

  foe_scav_flavor.5.title:0 "Death Trap"
  foe_scav_flavor.5.desc:0 "These buildings were probably filled with corpses, although she didn't really have the time to think why, she was only here to find anything useful. Velvet, along with the two other scavengers, agreed to head into the most rundown building, away from the smell plaguing the outside air. Upon closing the door, the interior lighting was almost pitch black, as barely anything could be seen. The miasmic smell still lingered, but it was thankfully not as bad as it was outside. As Velvet shuffled her pack for her flashlight, her ears jolted at the sound of sudden gunshots in the room. She turned towards the sound, but she was interrupted mid turn at the sound of more gunfire.\n\n"Bright!" Springflower screamed. Velvet hurriedly peered her flashlight in front of her, and met eyes with an armed ghoul barricaded at the far end of the lobby. No, wait. There were two of them. One of them had just been killed.\n\nMore gunfire. She saw Springflower collapse in pain.\n\nWithin the next moment, Velvet had the reflexes to shoot the other ghoul that remained, albeit almost blindly. The other ghoul was most likely killed by Bright before he...\n\nVelvet forced herself to shine the light at the corner where Bright Sky stood.\n\nShot in the head.\n\nHer horrored expression winced, the grizzled stallion didn't even say a word and let his reflexes take care of killing the ghoul in front of them. Bright Sky, dead because of two fucking ghouls. Velvet then turned to see a crumpled Springflower, and immediately rushed to the bleeding mare, blood gushing from her torso as she only coughed up more.\n\n"Oh fuck, Springflower, I'm-"\n\nAnother gunshot. Velvet's mouth opened, but no words came out. Instead, her strength left her body as she could feel the new sudden bullet wedged in her neck, and she collapsed on top of Springflower.\n\nWith her dimming vision, Velvet looked down at her friend, still breathing heavily. Springflower's chest rose and fell rapidly, but her wheezing grew worse by the second. More blood gushed from the wound in her chest, and it was most likely fatal.\n\nVelvet tried to whisper, but she couldn't. She didn't even bother to try to see if the ghouls were still alive, her reflexive shot towards the ghoul earlier must have only grazed him. At this point, she didn't care about her own death or the mission. Springflower could only force a smile as she died, with Velvet slyly giving one back as one final bullet pierced her head.\n\nThe ghoul then groaned, in pain more than in satisfaction, and collapsed as well."

Maybe the occasional rat or two scaring the shit out of him as they scurried out of random mouse holes. He was just about to give up and head back home, but he decided to give the first floor one more go. He's only scoured the lower floors twice compared to the upper floors which were only riddled with paintings of some unknown posh ponies prettily dressed for their photos.\n\nThe lobby, game room, kitchen... Sugarstar tried to recount the countless number of useless rooms this building had been built with. More cobwebs and spider nests, he couldn't begin to even remember why he gave this floor one more chance until...\n\nBLAM!\n\nIt's beady eyes were gone as quick as they came, splattered across the floor as Sugarstar tried to contain himself. After a few deep breaths, he took a closer look at what he had just killed. After shaking his head a few times to get his senses back together, he approached the ghoul, although quite nervously, and could tell it had most definitely gone feral. So old and gone was the rotting thing that he couldn't even tell how long it had been staying here, in this room out of the rest no less. It was so disgusting looking he couldn't even stare at it before forcing himself to look away, he couldn't even tell if it was a mare or a stallion, only that that thing was once a pony, and quite possibly the only living resident that decided to stay in the... music room?\n\nThe ghoul must've sheltered itself within its music. Gramophones, radios, a dusty piano and a rather nice looking jukebox, along with numerous records and discs and tapes on the shelves and tables. Upon closer inspection, ones that could no doubt be inserted into any of these numerous players. The jukebox itself seemed to still be stuffed with various records. He searched the room for a coin and... bingo. One convenient one lying right next to the thing, lying right next to a bunch of others. Perhaps the old ghoul had some use after all.\n\nSugarstar inserted the coin, and navigated the controls to select a random record. Within seconds, the thing rumbled a tune that had him smiling within seconds."

  foe_scav_flavor.7.title:0 "An Encounter"
  foe_scav_flavor.7.desc:0 "The light of the campfire continued to crack. Brisk Light sat alone next to the fire, and although this was his second night in the mission, he appreciated the isolation, especially if it's more of a common thing to experience in the wastes. He looked up at the sky and scanned for a change in atmosphere. Nothing but dark, radiated clouds. There wasn't much left of the city that once stood here as well, although it did serve as a decent spot to camp. All that remained now was rubble and debris, same as every other nuked town in Equestria.\n\nAs he studied the clouds above, he nearly jumped at the voice of an approaching pony.\n\n"Mind if I join?"\n\nHe suddenly calmed himself and then nodded as the stranger joined him by the campfire. Although it sounded like the voice carried weight, the wastelander's appearance didn't show much detail while constricted under the outfit they carried. He couldn't even tell the type of pony, although he didn't really notice any wings or horn. At least, not outside the outfit. They looked equipped with enough gear that probably told Brisk more than he needed to know about the pony. \n\nDespite the warm exchange, the two didn't speak for some time. Brisk tried to make an effort to avoid conversation, but he couldn't help but to study the stranger carefully. Their calm nature was surprising, although it was nice to meet someone who didn't panic at everything for a change. The stranger seemed friendly enough, who knows how their day went, can't possibly be more boring than what Brisk had been through.\n\nHe glanced between the fire and the stranger. Eventually, he noticed a glowing device on their foreleg.\n\n"That's a PipBuck." Bright commented. The wastelander smiled and lifted the leg carrying the device.\n\n"First time seeing one? Gotta admit, they're pretty useful when you need them."\n\nBrisk couldn't help but smile back.\n\nAfter a while, he finally got himself to stop gawking and began to stare at the dirt beneath him instead. The other pony was clearly a veteran traveler, he thought. It didn't take much to know that the wastelander had probably been through quite a bit of hardship, given the rough weight in their voice and their easy approach to the campfire. Even then, Brisk was at least happy he could spend some time with someone else during this scavenging mission.\n\n"So, what's your-"\n\nThe mysterious wastelander had already left.\n\n"Hey!" Brisk shouted out. No reply came.\n\n"Fuck me," Brisk muttered. Realizing he phased out of reality for too long, he let out a sigh and sat back down.\n\nBrisk spent all night trying to figure out who that might've been, until it struck him."

  foe_scav_flavor.8.title:0 "Datamining"
  foe_scav_flavor.8.desc:0 "After hours of scavenging the abandoned lab, Licorice finally reached a noteworthy room: a room full of computers. There were several terminals set up around the room, each connected to different machines and old servers. The terminals were definitely RoBronco, although some of them still glowed, indicating that they were never powered off. Two were connected to a local power source in the room, while a third terminal was plugged directly into a wall socket, which meant it must have been powered by electricity from somewhere else in the lab. The fourth terminal was not connected to anything, but it being stacked on top of papers meant it was never used much to begin with.\n\nThere was a fifth terminal he nearly skipped in the corner. This last one seemed out of place, since most of the other terminals were either running programs or displaying information. This one just displayed a blank screen of green. Maybe they weren't actually using any of these terminals? Maybe they just wanted him to think they were. \n\nLicorice shut his overthinking brain and started searching the remainder of the room. He began browsing the terminals for any useful information for the scavenging mission. Unfortunately, none of them showed much promise. Most of them were password protected, and the few that weren't were locked down with software designed to prevent unauthorized access. He tried cracking open the passwords, but he was never the hacking type. After an hour of trying, nothing worked. Eventually, he gave up and moved onto the terminal with the blank screen. After detaching the plug and plugging it back in, the screen powered on once more with actual information. It was password protected as well, but he managed to crack it easily, as surprising as it was to him. When he opened the only file on its desktop, however, he found that it was just a simple text document containing a single line of code.\n\n"§d01000111 01001111 01001110 01000101§!"\n\nA series of numbers, which he assumed was something important, although Licorice never understood code so he didn't pay it much attention.\n\nAlthough, the thought of him being tracked now was something that spooked him. He hurriedly took note of the coordinates and made sure to write them down. He then turned off the terminal and stared at the terminals one last time. He knew there had to be something valuable in some of these machines. He decided to head back, stuffing the notebook that contained the coordinates of the lab into his pack."

  foe_scav_flavor.9.title:0 "An Unexpected Gift"
  foe_scav_flavor.9.desc:0 "Recent events hadn't been kind to Shorehoof. First a highwaymare stole all his caps, then he had the misfortune of turning a corner and bumping straight into a pack of ferals. Now, he was left trying to catch his breath behind a pile of concrete within a blown out ruin. Today just wasn't his day. At least it couldn't get much worse.\n\nThe noise of hoofsteps outside was quick to incite a curse, directed towards himself for tempting fate. Peeking around the rubble, Shorehoof's curses only intensified as he witnessed what he was up against. An alicorn! A Goddess-damned alicorn, prancing down the street without a care in the world! Ducking back behind his cover, the stallion made a quick prayer that the abomination out there wouldn't find him.\n\n'HELLO, WASTELAND PONY!' The voice of the alicorn was quick to assure the stallion of how royally bucked he was. Maybe it would at least make his death quick?\n\nAs the creature marched around the corner, the unlucky pony closed his eyes and braced for the inevitable. This was it then. No more Shorehoof.\n\nHe waited. And waited. Yet, nothing came. Daring to open one eye, he immediately jumped back away from the alicorn that was staring intently at him from less than a hoof-lengths away. The thing only responded to his movement by shouting once more, in a voice loud enough to cause his ears to ring.\n\n'WE COME TO SPREAD THE HOLIDAY CHEER! A GIFT, FROM US TO YOU!' The alicorn floated a box over to him, then stepped back. 'WE HOPE YOU FIND IT FESTIVE! HAVE A HAPPY HEARTHSWARMING!' With that, the alicorn turned and trotted away.\n\nSeveral minutes later, after Sorehoof's heart slowed down to a rate that could be considered almost normal, he slowly inched towards the package left by the alicorn. Undoing what seemed to be a makeshift sort of wrapping on it, he was greeted with a symbol that immediately made his eyes light up. A cross, overlaid by butterflies. He knew this symbol! Sure enough, opening up the box, he found it to be fully stocked with various medical supplies. Was that an extra-strength healing potion? It looked almost untouched!"

  foe_scav_flavor.10.title:0 "The Riverside Remains"
  foe_scav_flavor.10.desc:0 "Whistling a tune to herself, Merry Days trotted along the bank of a river. Though the riverside wasn't known for its wealth of salvage, the occasional good would drift down the river or wash up on the shore. In hope of finding these valuables, the lone mare made sure to look along the river at least once a month. Occasionally, she would even get lucky and find an old medical box or some capsized goods in the water.\n\nHer whistling began to fade as she saw streaks of red flowing through the water. Blood. A lot of it. Slowing her pace, she cautiously moved up the river. The stench of blood and decay hit her first, followed soon thereafter by the sight of it.\n\nBodies. Enough to fill a small army, all left to rot in the Sun. Merry was no stranger to death, but this was something else entirely. Most of the corpses were barely intact, with almost all of them missing limbs or looking as if they had been torn apart. What could of done this?\n\nRegardless of her reservations from the sight, she was still a scavenger at heart and there was quite a bit here to salvage. Moving to the first corpse, she picked a stray crab off of it and set to work trying to pry the makeshift metal armor from its former owner. She would just have to hope that whoever or whatever did all this didn't come back anytime soon."

  foe_scav_flavor.11.title:0 "Dealing With Raiders"
  foe_scav_flavor.11.desc:0 "Forward Way paused as he surveyed the situation. A band of raiders was camped out in front of an old house, gathered around a fire and sharing tales of their atrocities. Fortunately, they didn't seem to be anything special. However, there was no telling what could be in the house behind them.\n\nLooking over, Forward saw his two companions signal from their positions on each side of the raider camp. Everypony was in position. Excellent. With that, he threw his hoof up towards them as he took aim with his rifle. A few moments for his fellow scavengers to prepare and he brought his hoof down in a rapid motion. At the same time, his rifle recoiled within his telekinesis as it fired the first shot.\n\nThe raider he had been aiming for, the largest stallion of the bunch, went down as Forward's bullet slammed into his chest. The other three raiders were quick to react, but not quick enough, as Orange Bloom's revolver fired off from the right. Another raider down. One of them, a scraggly mare with a makeshift blade, tried to run inside the house. Another shot from Forward's rifle and she wouldn't be getting any further. The last raider turned and fled, straight towards Fairhoof's hiding spot. The sound of his shotgun would spell the end of the last raider.\n\nAll three scavengers moved towards the house the raiders had been guarding. Taking up position a safe distance away from the door, Forward called out to Fairhoof to head in first. The stallion in question slowly inched open the door, shotgun held tightly in his mouth as he peeked inside. He looked back at the other two, a strange look on his face as he beckoned them over. Moving to the door and looking inside, Forward was met with the sight of numerous slaves chained to one another."

  foe_scav_flavor.12.title:0 "The Abyss"
  foe_scav_flavor.12.desc:0 "Doubt crept at Misty Trot's mind as she continued to make her way through dry brambles. Daylight was quickly vanishing, as the night fell upon the land. Scratches already covered her, with more appearing by the minute thanks to the brush she found herself wading through. It wasn't a standard route, but rather one that would get her to her destination far quicker. The locals warned her against it, trying to tell her to stick to the proper roads, but the mare wouldn't be deterred. Something that was quickly proving to be a mistake, as her journey had already been ongoing for far longer than planned with no sign of stopping anytime soon.\n\nAs she pushed yet another bush off to the side, the unfortunate pony put one hoof forward before quickly falling back. In front of her, the ground had simply given way to a vast hole. A scar upon the surface of the planet, reaching deep into the unknown depths of the world. Catching her breath for a moment after having almost walked right into that seemingly endless abyss, Misty gazed down into that dark expanse, pondering as to what could of caused it. Was it natural? The result of Wartime industry? She knew not, but she figured it didn't matter regardless.\n\nStanding up and brushing herself off, the mare prepared to continue her effort to reach the other side of this overgrown expanse, not at all inclined to stay the night next to such an imposing formation. However, a noise brought her pause before she could trot away. What was that? Her ears perking up, she remained alert as the noise sounded out again. And again. And there it was once more! Slowly growing louder, a terrible rumbling began to fill the air. Another minute and she could feel it as much as hear it, something growing ever closer from within the hole itself!\n\nLooking down into it with equal amounts, curiosity, and fear, the mare thought herself prepared for the worst. What she would witness was not something that could of been prepared for though, as the creature from the depths began to enter the dim light cast by the Moon from above the clouds.\n\nGiant spindly legs, connected to a titanic body. Eyes, far too many of them, all ever-shifting as they stared into the soul of the mare before them. Pincers and teeth alike, countless in number and ready to rend apart any who found themselves unfortunate enough to be caught by them.\n\nMisty Trot remained frozen for just a moment, before taking off in a rapid gallop. Through the brush she ran, heedless of the many small injuries she was collecting. All she cared about was getting out of there, getting away from that creature. Even as her lungs burned for air and her legs protested against their abuse, she kept running. She wouldn't even realize that the creature had neglected to give chase, until she finally broke free of the bushcover. Safe from her pursuer, her legs finally gave out and she quickly collapsed onto the hard ground of the Wasteland."

  foe_scav_flavor.13.desc:0 "He-Who-Trots was not weak of heart. Far from it. He was one of the proudest scouts out there, bravely traversing the Wasteland and diving into old world ruins in search of threats and treasure alike. However, even he could be brought to fear. Such as he was now.\n\n'Do not resist. Submit to arrest and be vaporized.' The unnatural soulless voice of the metal demon echoed from down the hall. He-Who-Trots had simply been searching for the treasures of the old world when the demon had awakened, immediately setting upon the unprepared scout. It shot beams of death, seeking to erradicate his very soul! His only defence has been to run and hide, but the demon marched after him regardless.\n\nAs he prepared to gallop once more away from the slowly approaching monster, a loud noise from above drew his attention. Looking up, he was entraptured by the sight of a rapidly enlargening crack across the ceiling. A moment later and a great roar shook him to his very core, as the rafters finally gave way.\n\nLooking up, He-Who-Trots took a quick survey of himself. Everything was still there, nothing seemed broken. Looking around, he found that the same couldn't be said for the metal demon. It was completely crushed, first under a pile of rubble, and second under a great treaded machine.\n\nTruly, this was a gift from the spirits! They gave him this gift, from the skies above, to save him from the demon! He would have to make sure to bring their gift back with him, to let the whole tribe know of it."
