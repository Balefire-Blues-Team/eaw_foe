  foe_scav_flavor.1.title:0 "Like a Mouse in a Maze"
  foe_scav_flavor.1.desc:0 "\"Subject 1079, please do not attempt to damage the facility again.\" said the omnipresent computerized voice over the loudspeakers, and a single beep sounded from a collar. Quick Draw had dozed off inside a small building during her most recent hunt for valuable loot but had woken up to find herself in a completely different area with this collar strapped around her neck. The voice had informed her that \"the test had begun\". Up until now, the so-called \"test\" had appeared to be nothing more than a simple maze, but now she was stuck; As soon as she had entered this area, a door slid shut behind her, and a terminal on the wall had powered itself on.\n\nAs soon as she heard the beep from her collar, Quick Draw stopped her fruitless pounding on the door. Knowing all too well what that sound meant, she gulped and turned her attention to the terminal. The sickly green screen displayed a single line of text: §dGreetings, Subject 1079, do you wish to begin the exam portion? Y/N§!. Reaching a hoof forward, the mare entered \"§dY§!\" into the device, and a new question popped up on the screen.\n\n\"§dWho is the director of the Ministry of Wartime Technology?§!\"\n\nQuick Draw furrowed her brow for a moment, trying to remember the names of long-dead ponies before she eventually entered \"§dApplejack§!\". The terminal dinged, and another question loaded, this time a piece of basic algebra. Solving problem after problem and trivia question after trivia question, the terminal eventually went dark, and the door lifted open. Scurrying out of the room, Quick Draw wove her way through the rest of the maze, until at last, she found the exit. The voice spoke once again as she stepped out of the test, \"Congratulations, Subject 1079, please come back tomorrow for the next stage of the test.". Quick Draw ran out of the building as fast as her tired legs could carry her, never to return to that awful place.\n\nAs the noon broke the next day, a collar began to beep, and Subject 1079 was removed from the testing roster."
  foe_scav_flavor.1.a:0 "Begin the search for Subject 1080."

  foe_scav_flavor.2.title:0 "Super Times at the Super Duper Mart"
  foe_scav_flavor.2.desc:0 "Habberdash and Subtle Blip quietly together in a small ditch, as they patiently observed the large building the sat across the old, decrepit parking lot.\"Are you sure we’re going to even find anything in there?\” Habberdash asks, as he sat his binoculars down and turned to face Subtle Blip. \"That Super Duper Mart looks pretty cleaned out.\"\n\nSubtle let out a chuckle, as he loaded a fresh magazine into his rifle. \"Trust me, Habby. The information I got off that caravan pointed to an untouched Civil Defence supply cache within this very building.\"\n\nHabberdash let out a sigh, before levitating his pistol out and following Subtle Blip into the Super Duper Mart. At first glance, the store already seemed to be cleaned out of anything useful. Even many of the shelving units and counters have been removed, possibly for scrap or to be repurposed somewhere else. The more the two ponies searched around, the more apparent it became that there was nothing here. \"From the looks of it, you were most definitely scammed out of your caps.\" Habberdash said, as the two moved into the back of the store.\n\nSubtle Blip gave a nervous chuckle. \"I highly doubt that. Maybe we’re just in the wrong building.\” He said. \“Or, we’re looking in the wrong location.\"\n\nHabberdash just rolled his eyes at Subtle’s remark, as he entered the manager's office. "You seriously want me to bel-" However, before he could finish what he was saying the sound of old board breaking filled the back room, followed by a thud. \"Oooooo fuck!\" Habberdash cried out.\n\n\"Shit, Habby!\" Subtle cried out, as he ran into the office. \"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Yeah yeah, I am. Just fell through some old floor boards, that’s al\l" He groans out. \"Though I hope I didn’t hurt anything too badly\."\n\nAfter taking a moment to reorient himself and wait for Subtle to climb down to help him out, the pair of ponies turned their attention to looking around the room they had just stumbled upon. Though, it didn’t take them more than a minute to realize where they were. Sitting in front was a small sealed doorway with a faded Civil Defence sign hanging above it. \"And you thought I was scammed.\" Subtle said, giving Habberdash a wide grin."
  foe_scav_flavor.2.a:0 "Let's head back to town and grab a couple carts."

  foe_scav_flavor.3.title:0 "Tech Support"
  foe_scav_flavor.3.desc:0 "Arclight stared at the massive pre-war computer that had beed dragged into his workshop. He was told that one of the scavenging teams came across it while searching through an old Robronco office complex and that they wanted to see if he could try and get it running in order to see what was on it. Now, most ponies would look at this beautiful piece of pre-war technology and not really give a molerat's ass about it, as they had better things to do than fiddle with something they most likely didn’t understand. But, for Arclight, this was right up his alley, his ability to understand technology was second to none. However, after a couple days of fiddling around with the old computer, Arclight found himself in need of some help. Help that came in the form of an old, dismantled robobrain.\n\nThe robobrain slowly powered itself back on, as Arclight had it turned off to save power. After a few minutes, the creepy mechanical iris lit up and blinked. \"§dOh great, it’s the little gremlin.§!\" The robobrain rudely remarked. \"§dBack again to ruin my chassis or are you planning to ask me another series of convoluted and downright stupid questions?§!\"\n\nArclight let out a slow and heavy sigh, as he pressed a hoof to his forehead. \"Hey DOC, glad to see you haven’t changed.\" Arclight groaned out\n\n\"§dNo thanks to you, you little gremlin. So, what have you powered me on for this time?§!\" He asked. \"§dA mathematical question? A question about the old world? Another conversation about what taxes are?§!\"\n\n"Not exactly." Arclight says, motioning over to the large pre-war computer. "I've been messing around with this old Robronco Data Storage Computer, but I still can’t figure out what’s wrong with it. All the internal components were in surprisingly good condition and the chase was only slightly damaged. At this point, I am afraid I’ll have to just scrap it, because I can’t get it to turn on."\n\nDOC’s mechanical iris looked over at Arclight, before turning to face the computer. \"§dI don’t know, have you tried plugging it in? That usually works.§!\"\n\nArclight stared at him for a moment, before slowly heading around to the back of the computer. After a moment of fiddling about, Arclight was able to find the power cord, which was, to his surprise, not plugged in. \"Oh for Celestia’s sake.\" He groaned out, before taking the cord and plugging it into the nearby generator.\n\n\"§dHah, gets them every time.§!\" DOC chuckled out. \"§dNow then, plug that bad buck in and let’s see what secrets this thing holds.§!\""
