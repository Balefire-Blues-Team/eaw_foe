### Opening Focuses ###

 OAP_opening_1:0 "Under the Scorching Sun"
 OAP_opening_1_desc:0 "The Wasteland we inherited from old Equestria is quite different compared to the rest of the Wasteland. The land of scorching sun has decided to call nopony except us. We have been shaped by this land, just as it has been shaped by us."
 
 OAP_opening_2:0 "In the Land of Sand and Profit"
 OAP_opening_2_desc:0 "What fools see as an inhospitable desert, we see as an oasis of opportunity, with its sands offering boundless profit to those daring enough to reap from it."
 
 OAP_opening_3:0 "An Offer We Couldn't Refuse"
 OAP_opening_3_desc:0 "While not many look to our region as an opportunity for investment, one certain charismatic stallion from across the Wastes has turned his eyes towards our humid nation..."
 
 OAP_economic_reshuffle:0 "Economic Reshuffle"
 OAP_economic_reshuffle_desc:0 "The strength of our economy is at the worst it's ever been. If we are to prosper, or at least change, we must take our economy into a new direction. The question of course lies in where?"
 
 OAP_investements_from_RED:0 "Investments from Fillydelphia"
 OAP_investements_from_RED_desc:0 "Luckily for us, our connections with Fillydelphia and the slavers there can grant us the push our economy so desperately needs, even if others dislike the idea of seeking investments from outside our borders."
 
 OAP_import_heavy_industry:0 "Import Heavy Machinery"
 OAP_import_heavy_industry_desc:0 "One thing we could definitely use more of is some good old fashioned machinery, and while Appleloosa lacks the industry to produce her own, our trading opportunities with Fillydelphia can provide us with the spinning cogs we need."
 
 OAP_homegrown_industry:0 "Focus on Civilian Industry"
 OAP_homegrown_industry_desc:0 "Local investments into our own economy can be lucrative if we know where to focus. Our civilian sector is a safe option, even if it means repurposing our older Wartime factories into more modern, versatile ones."
 
 OAP_subsidize_merchants:0 "Subsidize Local Merchants"
 OAP_subsidize_merchants_desc:0 "One surefire way to boost the flow of caps throughout Appleloosa is to simply invest in our local merchants and arms dealers. Subsidizing our merchants can only strengthen our civilian industry while ensuring the stability of our political influence."
 
 OAP_farming_desert:0 "Cacti-Farms in the Desert"
 OAP_farming_desert_desc:0 "Of course, strengthening our economy in all possible sectors includes seeking opportunities in our own lands. We would be wise to exploit our unending deserts and grow our own cacti-farms, native only to the deserts of Appleloosa herself."
 
 OAP_fillydelphian_model:0 "The Fillydelphian Model"
 OAP_fillydelphian_model_desc:0 "While many would call it cruel, the Fillydelphian model of Wasteland economics is nothing if not efficient. While focusing most slaves into the heavy-industry sector would present a problem during wartime should such industrial centres be captured, our industrial growth during peacetime would skyrocket!"
 
 OAP_like_old_times:0 "Like the Good Old Times"
 OAP_like_old_times_desc:0 "Heavy industry is nice and all, but the near-mythical Mixie Way of life demands a more rural approach to slavery. Wealthy merchants and plantation-owners control their slaves directly and use them to farm the land or extract the resources we need. We should return to those old values, lest we be doomed by Red Eye's ideas."
 
 OAP_currency_control_issue:0 "Delay Inflation"
 OAP_currency_control_issue_desc:0 "The value of our caps is headed nowhere but deep beneath our sands. While tackling our inflation is a long-term process, implementing immediate relief measures can definitely slow its progress."
 
 OAP_fasttrack_reform:0 "Fasttrack our Industry"
 OAP_fasttrack_reform_desc:0 "We need to industrialize, and we need to do it fast!\nMany in our country will disapprove seeing their way of life threatened, and the Rangers will undoubtedly use this as an excuse to recruit, but this is the best option we have."
 
 OAP_charmings_proposal:0 "Charming Luck's Proposal"
 OAP_charmings_proposal_desc:0 "Interesting... a letter from Charming Luck has been presented to me, what could he want?"
 
 OAP_bandaid_braindrain:0 "A Band-Aid for the Braindrain"
 OAP_bandaid_braindrain_desc:0 "Our technological literacy is abysmal, and if nothing is done to fix it in time, not even our smartest ponies will be able to rescue Appleloosa from another dark age. We must reform our research methods and implement a proper scientific method."
 
 OAP_safe_reforms:0 "Safe Reforms"
 OAP_safe_reforms_desc:0 "While change is desperately needed to drag our economy out of the sands, unsafe and extreme changes only have the harm of damaging our economy even further. Implementing safer reforms will pull ourselves out of the sands and make sure we don't shoot ourselves in the hoof while doing so."
 
 OAP_ask_RED_help:0 "Request Fillydelphian Aid"
 OAP_ask_RED_help_desc:0 "Aligning ourselves with Fillydephia's sphere has already proven wonders for boosting our own industrial capacity. Requesting more aid would only speed this process even more!"
 
 OAP_learn_from_azuria:0 "Learn from Azuria"
 OAP_learn_from_azuria_desc:0 "Shattered Hoof has managed to resist the pull of Red Eye despite his best efforts, and the other Azurian nations sure seem to follow that trend. We should learn from them and undermine Fillydelphia's influence in our own nation as well."
 
 OAP_deal_with_farsight:0 "Deal with Farsight"
 OAP_deal_with_farsight_desc:0 "Farsight has remained as a priority target for far too long, it's about time we do something about this troublesome ranger..."
 
 OAP_most_loyal_servant:0 "His Most Loyal Servant"
 OAP_most_loyal_servant_desc:0 "[RED.GetLeader] and their slavers have already proven themselves to be the de facto powerhouse of the wastes. Their prowess at maintaining such a large slaver empire is unquestionable, it only makes sense for Appleloosa to follow in their hoofsteps."
 
 OAP_return_to_tradition:0 "Returning to Tradition"
 OAP_return_to_tradition_desc:0 "Appleloosa has spent far too long tied to her shackles, blood needlessly dripping from her innumerable slaves toiling away at a meaningless future that awards nopony but the maniacal. At last, we have the opportunity to resurface our traditions!"
 
 OAP_appleloosan_army:0 "A New Appleloosan Defense Force"
 OAP_appleloosan_army_desc:0 "An entirely new military shall be formed, made up of none but sun-scorched ponies who call these deserts home. Appleloosa only deserves the best to defend her sands."
 
 OAP_ranger_army:0 "Let the Rangers keep their Positions"
 OAP_ranger_army_desc:0 "The Rangers, while relentlessly proving themselves to be a nuisance, can no doubt be mistaken for their combat prowess and unparalleled skill in desert operations. Perhaps it would be better if we were to leave them alone..."
 
 OAP_doctrinal_thought:0 "Doctrinal Thought"
 OAP_doctrinal_thought_desc:0 "Advancing our military thought involves implementing a proper doctrine, and our generals may have the right idea on where to properly innovate."
 
 OAP_expand_spec_ops:0 "Special Forces Program"
 OAP_expand_spec_ops_desc:0 "While we are quite used to training on our own deserts, it's quite clear our numbers will never match those of larger powers. Small, focused elite units specialized in specific areas might be just what we need to overcome any threat."
 
 OAP_buy_big_guns:0 "Buy Weapon-Blueprints"
 OAP_buy_big_guns_desc:0 "Focusing on quality requires us to upgrade our weaponry, and developing these weapons at home requires our very own blueprints. Acquiring these blueprints should be our next priority."
 
 OAP_train_up_masses:0 "Train up the Masses"
 OAP_train_up_masses_desc:0 "While not many reside within our borders, there are still many still eager to fight for Appleloosa. All we need is a proper recruitment wave to bolster our ranks."
 
 OAP_buy_many_guns:0 "Buy Guns in Bulk"
 OAP_buy_many_guns_desc:0 "No soldier is useful without their own gun. Why not put our caps to use and acquire some weaponry for our loyal soldiers?"

 
### Steel Shackles Tree ###
 
 OAP_power_cemented:0 "Power Reaffirmed"
 OAP_power_cemented_desc:0 "With my control over Old Appleloosa reaffirmed, now the time has come to make sweeping changes to the nation. For now, ensuring the stable flow of slaves from the Southwest seems a good idea."
 
 OAP_southwest_trade:0 "New Trade-Deals with the Southwest"
 OAP_southwest_trade_desc:0 "The powers to the Southwest have ponies, we have grain and cash crops. By forging trade deals we can ensure a steady supply of slave labor, while ensuring our neighbors are dependent on us for their food supply. It’s a win-win!"
 
 OAP_seize_slaves:0 "Seize the Slaves of Opponents"
 OAP_seize_slaves_desc:0 "Old Appleloosa’s gentry is content to waste their lives in decadence on their plantations. Worse they’re wasting their slave’s lives working the fields when their labor could be used to turn this ramshackle town into a major power! But with Charming Luck out of the picture, there is no one to stop me from bringing these loathsome aristocrats to heel. It’s time to seize the planter’s slaves, and give mysel... er, I mean the state an invaluable labor supply."
 
 OAP_increase_imports:0 "Increase Resource Imports"
 OAP_increase_imports_desc:0 "Building Old Appleloosa into a major power will require industrialization. But industrialization requires heavy metal and advanced resources that we can not produce for ourselves. Our cap supply will take a hefty hit, but the investment will pay for itself soon enough."
 
 OAP_slaves_research:0 "Slave Research-Assistants"
 OAP_slaves_research_desc:0 "Many of my newly acquired slaves are bright young minds full of potential. Potential that Appleloosa’s gentry squandered by making them perform back breaking manual labor day in and day out. They would be far more useful assisting our scientists in their research, and just like interns, they don’t have to be paid."
 
 OAP_slaves_factory:0 "Industrial Slavery"
 OAP_slaves_factory_desc:0 "While the remaining gentry use their slaves to till the land, the state will industrialize itself using the slaves seized from my political opponents."
 
 OAP_stop_braindrain:0 "Plugging the Braindrain"
 OAP_stop_braindrain_desc:0 "Appleloosa’s top minds are finally choosing to stay at home thanks to our new education system and access to cheap research assistants. With a little more time and the proper policy push our braindrain problem will finally be over."
 
 OAP_meet_red:0 "Meet With [RED.GetLeader]"
 OAP_meet_red_desc:0 "A rising power within the ruins of Fillydelphia has rapidly become one of the strongest forces in the Wasteland. Founded by the charismatic Red Eye, this army of slavers, raiders, and talons has managed to cement itself as a powerhouse. They have been valuable trading partners for a while now, but it is finally time for us to meet with [RED.GetLeader] in pony, so as to discuss our future."
 
 OAP_research_cathedral:0 "Research From the Cathedral"
 OAP_research_cathedral_desc:0 "Cooperating with Red Eye has to be the best thing I’ve ever done! That sucker is now sending us additional researchers and technology from the Cathedral!"
 
 OAP_slaver_exchange_program:0 "Slaver-Exchange Program"
 OAP_slaver_exchange_program_desc:0 "As part of my meeting with Red Eye, he requested that we set up a "Slaver-Exchange Program" so that both of our nation’s slavers can broaden their areas of expertise and learn from each other's techniques. While I question the logic, and wonder if this is just an attempt to get spy on us, we don’t have much of a choice at the moment."
 
 OAP_ask_NAP:0 "Ask for New Appleloosa"
 OAP_ask_NAP_desc:0 "Our sister city to the Northeast has fallen under Red Eye’s influence! If I offer greater cooperation and subservience to Red Eye, he should grant us the administration of the territory... Hopefully."
 
 OAP_united_NAP:0 "United at Last"
 OAP_united_NAP_desc:0 "Thanks to Red Eye’s generosity, Old and New Appleloosa are finally united under one rule. My Rule! No longer shall Appleloosans be divided by such petty ideas such as "distance" or "self rule" or that "slavery is wrong''. Now it is time to found a united Grand Appleloosan Nation!"
 
 OAP_sister_NAP:0 "Cooperation Between Sister-Nations"
 OAP_sister_NAP_desc:0 "Whelp, Red Eye denied my frankly overly generous offer to unify Old and New Appleloosa. No matter, Old and New Appleloosa have been divided for centuries anyways. Cooperation with our sister nation will be good enough, they will serve as a profitable trading hub for our goods."
 
 OAP_couple_eco:0 "Exploit our Connection to Red Eye"
 OAP_couple_eco_desc:0 "Old Appleloosa has loyally served Red Eye for a number of months now. Case in point, I’ve been on a number of expeditions to Fillydelphia to inform him of our progress, and he is delighted! Honestly, I’d dare say I’m a good friend of Red Eye. I’m sure he’d look the way and help us out a bit, allowing Old Appleloosa some greater autonomy and industrial aid."
 
 OAP_payouts_to_supporters:0 "Payouts to Close Supporters"
 OAP_payouts_to_supporters_desc:0 "While most of Old Appleloosa gentry support Charming Luck, I do have a number of supporters among Old Appleloosa’s middle class. Small Plantation owners, free artisan laborers and yeoman, and the intellectuals who choose to remain here. If I am going to stay in power for any amount of time, then they need to be given some kickbacks. At least this will also put my supporters on a more equal playing field to the gentry."

 OAP_arrest_charming:0 "Arrest Charming Luck"
 OAP_arrest_charming_desc:0 "Despite my best efforts Charming Luck continues to be an irksome thorn in my side. Most of the gentry continue to support him and disapprove of my reforms, despite his attempts to rile up the slave population in revolt... Or at least that's what the official sheriff's reports will say once he’s locked up behind bars! This will show those pompous assholes what happens to people who get in my way!"

 OAP_stabilize:0 "Stabilize the Country"
 OAP_stabilize_desc:0 "Charming Luck is rotting in prison and my supporters pockets are lined with caps. The gentry can whine and moan all they like, but there is little they can do now. Old Appleloosa’s divisions are not gone, but I have successfully won the power struggle and stability is returning."
 
 OAP_reorganize_industry:0 "Reorganize our Industry"
 OAP_reorganize_industry_desc:0 "Old Appleloosa’s industrial sector lacks the flexibility of a proper industrial power. From the supply chain to the factory, the whole system is in dire need of reorganization. Our first step should be centralizing production in urban centers and streamlining production to allow factories to produce more than one type of good."
 
 OAP_urbanize_pops:0 "Urbanizing the Population"
 OAP_urbanize_pops_desc:0 "Old Appleloosa has historically been a very agrarian country, thanks to the political dominance of the planter class. However, most of my supporters come from the city of Old Appleloosa. Thanks to my earlier industrial reforms, the population has already started to move to the city. However, one metropolis is not enough to secure my power, nor the power of an empire. We need to start building up our rural communities into urban centers in their own right."
 
 OAP_smelting_iron:0 "The 'Iron Sands' Extraction-Complex"
 OAP_smelting_iron_desc:0 "Desert near Appleloosa contains a large supply of Iron Sand. While most societies see this kind of iron as useless. However, I see it as a well of untapped potential. Establishing an extraction complex to refine our iron sand deposits into steel will make up for our lack of mineral deposits elsewhere."
 
 OAP_purify_water:0 "Purify the River-Water"
 OAP_purify_water_desc:0 "Balefire contamination and years of sewage has made the rivers running through Appleloosa toxic, greatly limiting our water and even food supply. Thankfully with a little bit of Red Eye’s earth pony know how, and unicorn magic, we can begin the long process of purifying our sources of water."
 
 OAP_gateway:0 "A Gateway to New Appleloosa"
 OAP_gateway_desc:0 "If we are ever going to make the dream of Grand Appleloosa a reality, we will have to secure the land between us and them! The only thing standing in our way is a pathetic and hopeless band of scavengers. Old Appleloosa our glory is at hand, TO WAR!"
 
 OAP_expand_rails:0 "Expand the Railroads"
 OAP_expand_rails_desc:0 "The Railroad has always been the lifeblood of Old Appleloosa, from its initial settlement until today connecting us to our sister city and the rest of the world. As Appleloosa expands, so too must our core rail network, if only to better serve our future expansions."
 
 OAP_tradepost_cloudsdale:0 "Connect to Cloudsdale"
 OAP_tradepost_cloudsdale_desc:0 "Now that we’ve improved our main rail networks we are able to connect our newly pacified lands to the rest of our country... Or at the least we’ll connect the two Appleloosa’s to Cloudsdale."
 
 OAP_integrate_LIT:0 "Integrate Our New Lands"
 OAP_integrate_LIT_desc:0 "The Lightning Scavengers have been conquered, their leaders are either dead or missing, and the resistance is dispersed and enslaved. The survivors and those willing to pledge loyalty to me should be rewarded, and brought into my new Grand Appleloosan Nation!"
 
 OAP_final_confron:0 "Prepare for the Final Confrontation"
 OAP_final_confron_desc:0 "If I’m going to become the undisputed master of the wasteland a war with Red Eye is inevitable, and in order to break his empire I will need one of my own. I may have united Grand Appleloosa but it is just a singular nation. Prepare the troops, at dawn we conquer Azuria!"
 
 OAP_hold_line:0 "Hold the Line"
 OAP_hold_line_desc:0 "The Shattered Hoof Raiders are a fierce enemy and they outnumber our own forces. Our best chance at success is to hunker down along a defensive position, build trenches, and pick off their waves as they come. They cannot replace their losses forever, and once their forces are depleted we can once again go on the offensive."
 
 OAP_push_azure:0 "Push Across the Azureway"
 OAP_push_azure_desc:0 "We may be outnumbered, but Shattered Hoof Raider’s are undisciplined. By concentrating our forces we can shatter their forces and push through them and across the Azureway! Once we’ve secured the Shattered Hoof Re-Education Facility their disorganized forces will surely collapse."
 
 OAP_call_reserve:0 "Call up Reserves"
 OAP_call_reserve_desc:0 "The war for Azuria is wrapping up, but in order to seal our victory we’re going to need more forces in the field. Call up our reserve troops and get them to the frontline."
 
 OAP_cpacify_locals:0 "Pacify the Locals"
 OAP_cpacify_locals_desc:0 "The locals of Azuria are a rowdy and violent bunch. By handing power to "agreeable" raiders in exchange for "retiring" their old bosses we can ensure the violent and rowdy ponies are only violent and rowdy for us!"
 
 OAP_our_reward:0 "Our Due Reward"
 OAP_our_reward_desc:0 "I have been a loyal servant to Red Eye since we first met, and now we have pacified Azuria for him. It is high time that we were rewarded for our service! Nothing less than the complete administration of Azuria will do!"
 
 OAP_loyalty:0 "A Question of Loyalty"
 OAP_loyalty_desc:0 "Holy shit he accepted my demands... I was certain he would deny me and start a war. Maybe we can still work with him? Then again... it would be a lot more fun to replace him. Hmmm decisions, decisions..."
 
 OAP_war_for_heartlands:0 "The Final War"
 OAP_war_for_heartlands_desc:0 "Finally, the Time has come.\nWith my nation as strong as never before, we can stand up against Red Eye, and drag him down from his throne!\nI, Steel Shackles, shall take his place as the Master of Grand Appleloosa, Azuria, and Fillydelphia!"
 
 OAP_azurian_legions:0 "The Azurian Legions"
 OAP_azurian_legions_desc:0 "Our war with the Shattered Hoof Raiders demonstrated the Azurian ponies' proficiency for war. We have already employed a number of them to pacify their own country, so it only makes sense to unify these motley militias into a professional army; the Azurian Legions!"
 
 OAP_get_gunds:0 "Corner the Black Market"
 OAP_get_gunds_desc:0 "We will spend a nice chunk of our considerable wealth, to buy up some of the most High-tech weapons from across the Wasteland."
 
 OAP_nationalize_all_gun_workshops:0 "Nationalize All Gun-Workshops"
 OAP_nationalize_all_gun_workshops_desc:0 "In order to defeat Red Eye we’re going to need to be able to compete with his own military production. We cannot be held back by private interests and  profits driving the price higher than the cost of production."
 
 OAP_incite_uprisings:0 "Incite Slave-Uprisings"
 OAP_incite_uprisings_desc:0 "Red Eye’s slaver-exchanges have been a double bladed sword it appears. Whether he intended to use the slavers sent to us as spies or not, I had that idea myself at least, and our slavers learned some juicy information. Red Eye’s slave empire is far more brutal than ours, and I see no reason to not use that to our advantage. Promises of peace and freedom... or at the least more comfy work conditions could sway some of Red Eye’s slaves into rebellion."
 
 OAP_plantation_army:0 "Press Plantation-Slaves into the Army"
 OAP_plantation_army_desc:0 "The planter class has always stood in the way of my ambition, and in the way of Grand Appleloosia’s rise. Their decadency finally ends now, we can no longer afford to maintain their lavish and hedonistic lifestyles. As a final blow to those perfidious planters, their slaves will be pressed into the army. They will be far more useful there than growing more cash crops and lining the pockets of the greedy geriatric gentry."

 OAP_red_schools:0 "Implement Red Eye's Schooling System"
 OAP_red_schools_desc:0 "Red Eye has implemented a robust system of education throughout his empire, one of the many reasons I’m sure he has achieved so much success. An educated populus would bring many advantages to Appleloosa  of our own... although it could also act as a very efficient propaganda tool as well."
 
 OAP_red_victory:0 "Victory in the Final War!"
 OAP_red_victory_desc:0 "It was a hard fought and brutal war, but through grit, determination, countless reforms and structural changes we have come out victorious! From Fillydelphia to Old Appleloosa, I reign as the sole ruler of the wasteland! Long live our glorious leader; Emperor and Master Steel Shackles."
 
 OAP_hunt_dissidents_monsters:0 "Hunt Dissidents and Monsters"
 OAP_hunt_dissidents_monsters_desc:0 "What do you mean that they misunderstood what I said? How could anyone confuse "Hey let’s make it a yearly tradition to hunt dissidents and monsters" for killing alicorns? Those are not even a factor here... I see, ok yea that makes sense, Alicorns are pretty monstrous. Fine, I'll change the name to the Servile Hunt. How does that sound? Gets the point across, ok, now let's round up some of those slaves, ideally the most feisty. We’re going to hunt the most dangerous game... ponies."
 
 OAP_bribe_generals:0 "Government Positions for the Family"
 OAP_bribe_generals_desc:0 "The old government was full of my enemies and pawns of the planters. Luckily now that I’ve taken power the old government doesn't matter anymore, and I can appoint anyone I want! We could  finally do away with the cronyism and nepotism in Old Appleloosa... or I could just give power to my family, I mean they are my greatest supporters and agree with my positions after all."
 
 OAP_hire_talons:0 "Hire Our Own Talons"
 OAP_hire_talons_desc:0 "The Talon's have been serving various clients across post-apocalyptic Equestria for centuries now. The various griffon companies have proven their dedication to earning caps time and time again, willing to do anything if a sizable paycheck is involved. Griselda's Talons is a relatively new company, which just so happens to be seeking a patron. They will serve us well."
 
 OAP_invite_fillydelphian_advisors:0 "New Slave Soldiers"
 OAP_invite_fillydelphian_advisors_desc:0 "Some say that slaves make terrible soldiers, but those ponies simply don't know how to properly break a slave!\nMonths of brutal training and indoctrination may kill three out of every four slaves we train, but the survivors will be good and mindless soldiers."
 
 OAP_anti_machine_weapons:0 "Anti-Machine Weaponry"
 OAP_anti_machine_weapons_desc:0 "Vehicles are rare in the Wasteland. Power armor is less so, but it is mostly in the hooves of the Steel Rangers. Still, as these machines become more common on the battlefield we will need weapons that can defeat them. Anti-Machine weaponry, if you will."
 
 OAP_mass_drills:0 "Massed Combat Drills"
 OAP_mass_drills_desc:0 "If we want our slave army to be successful, they’re going to have to learn to fight. While Griselda and her Talons are at home they can be put to use training our slave army for mass combat."
 
 OAP_serve_either_way:0 "An Army of Slaves and Masters"
 OAP_serve_either_way_desc:0 "With our slaves trained for mass combat, our army reforms are starting to wrap up. From now on our army will consist of more than just aristocratic officers and poor free-pony soldiers. From now on slaves and masters will serve together! With the slaves serving as the backbone of our armies while the masters serve as officers and specialists."
 
 OAP_what_navy:0 "What the Tartarus is a Navy?"
 OAP_what_navy_desc:0 "What in Celestia’s name is a boat? You mean there are bodies of water big enough to have vehicles travel them? Well whatever the Tartarus a navy is, if other countries have them I want one too!"
 
 OAP_guns_on_boats:0 "Guns on Boats"
 OAP_guns_on_boats_desc:0 "Wait you mean to tell me they put guns on their boats? So that’s what a navy is. Alright, easy enough, we have plenty of guns, and we are starting to build boats, we’ll just combine the two. In a few months time we’ll be rolling up on the shores of our enemies! It will be like "Knock Knock. It’s Old Appleloosa. With huge boats (with guns)... gunboats.""
 
 OAP_buy_rowing_slaves:0 "Experienced Rowing-Slaves"
 OAP_buy_rowing_slaves_desc:0 "Other countries with navies are known to have many experienced rowers powering their ships. Luckily most of these rowers are also slaves, so I’m sure we’ll just be able to purchase a few of them for our own navy... Lets just hope they don’t ask why we need a navy."
 
 OAP_dockyards:0 "Build Actual Dockyards"
 OAP_dockyards_desc:0 "We have a handful of fishing docks, but that won’t cut it for a mass produced navy. We need to build actual dockyards that can build, supply, and launch new ships."
 
 OAP_river_fleet:0 "A River-Fleet"
 OAP_river_fleet_desc:0 "Our first ships will finally be put to sea, or more accurately put to the river. I can finally start projecting Appleloosa’s power even if it’s just across the rivers of the wasteland."
 
 OAP_desert_navy:0 "The Navy of a Desert-Country"
 OAP_desert_navy_desc:0 "For a landlocked desert-country, the concept of a navy seems absurd. However, this is a foalish notion. All great powers have navies! Therefore if Appleloosa is going to become a great power we need a navy! That dream is finally coming to fruition."
 
 OAP_import_chems:0 "Import Chems"
 OAP_import_chems_desc:0 "An army needs to be healthy in order to fight at its best! Or at the very least it needs to be hopped up on thirty different kinds of drugs... Unfortunately we’re unable to produce our own stimpacks and drugs, so we’re going to have to import them."
 
 OAP_desert_logistics:0 "Desert Logistics"
 OAP_desert_logistics_desc:0 "Old Appleloosa is built on a desert, we have plenty of experience with the land. The desert provides many unique logistical challenges to overcome, but in time they will be overcome."
 
 OAP_spike_explosives:0 "Spiked Explosives"
 OAP_spike_explosives_desc:0 "I just had a brilliant idea! If we want to make our explosives more effective, we could cover them in spikes, or nails or something else pointy! Yes, this has no chance of backfiring what so ever. I’m a genius!"
 
 OAP_sand_buggys:0 "Sand-Buggys"
 OAP_sand_buggys_desc:0 "A handful of our population have been building their own vehicles for recreational activities in the desert. If we take inspiration from them we could build our own buggies to support our infantry in war."
 
 OAP_little_magic:0 "A Little Bit of Magic"
 OAP_little_magic_desc:0 "Old Appleloosa was founded primarily by earth ponies, and earth ponies still make up the majority of our population. However, we do have some unicorns, and even unicorn slaves. With a little bit of training we could have a little bit of magic in our army, as a treat."
 
 OAP_apple_army:0 "A New Appleloosan Army"
 OAP_apple_army_desc:0 "After many many additional reforms, we have finally completed our New Appleloosa Army. We have finally modernized our army into one which rivals the other great powers of the wasteland! And we did it all on our own... for the most part."
 
 OAP_take_skies:0 "Take to the Skies"
 OAP_take_skies_desc:0 "Most armies can field a handful of pegasi support troops, and so can we. However an actual air force, with planes and heavy ordinance, is all that will do for our great Appleloosan military!"
 
 OAP_airfield_appleloosa:0 "Airfield Appleloosa"
 OAP_airfield_appleloosa_desc:0 "Appleloosa's desert is full of empty flat land, perfect for building airfields and runways for our airforce."
 
 OAP_fighter_research:0 "Fightercraft"
 OAP_fighter_research_desc:0 "The backbone of any good airforce is the fighter. Thanks to our earth pony knowhow, and some old great war era planes we’ll be able to start building our own in no time!"
 
 OAP_cas_research:0 "Supportcraft"

 OAP_rangers_azuria_investements:0 "NCR Investments"
 OAP_rangers_azuria_investements_desc:0 "It is a sad truth that the New Canterlot Republic is far more prosperous than we shall ever be.

 OAP_rangers_military_desc:0 "Though it may not be possible for every soldier to be a Ranger, it is certainly possible for us to make our Rangers the backbone of the army.

 OAP_commanding_rangers:0 "A Ranger Government"
 OAP_commanding_rangers_desc:0 "Who better qualified to lead our nation than those Rangers who are willing to give their lives in its defence?

 OAP_ranger_pa:0 "Lessons From the Other Rangers"
 OAP_ranger_pa_desc:0 "There exists another group of so-called Rangers known as the Steel Rangers. Though their goals and our own do not align, we can't deny their effectiveness if even half of what we hear about them is true. Perhaps we could learn from them and begin investing in equipment that would allow each one of our Rangers to serve as walking tanks."

 OAP_ranger_fireteams:0 "Rapidfire Weapons Development"

 OAP_ranger_new_army_desc:0 "As time goes on, it is becoming increasingly clear that other nations across the Wasteland are trying to create the biggest armies possible. We deny this way of thinking.

 OAP_ranger_better_blueprints:0 "Buy Blueprints From Abroad"
 OAP_ranger_better_blueprints_desc:0 "There are some fields which we are greatly lacking in, with little hope to improve our understanding through conventional means.

 OAP_ranger_hoofington_robots:0 "Hire Roboticists From Hoofington"
 OAP_ranger_hoofington_robots_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, we simply don't have enough soldiers to effectively defend our land. In order to solve this problem, we will seek out experts from the south to help us create automated soldiers able to fight in the stead of ponies."
 
 OAP_ranger_specialized_robotics:0 "Studying Wartime Robotics"
 OAP_ranger_specialized_robotics_desc:0 "During the Great War, Equestria relied heavily on robotic forces both domestically and on the front lines.

 OAP_ranger_las_pegasus_aircraft:0 "Hire Aeronauts From Las Pegasus"
 OAP_ranger_las_pegasus_aircraft_desc:0 "Far to the west is the grand city of Las Pegasus. Thanks to the political climate, many of the pegasi residing there would be willing to relocate to our own lands. Their experience would be invaluable towards giving us an edge in aerial combat."
 
 OAP_ranger_desert_motorisation:0 "Desert Motorization"
 OAP_ranger_desert_motorisation_desc:0 "Vehicles move far faster than ponies ever could. Cars, trucks, and tanks alike would all give us a definite edge when it comes to dealing with those who seek us harm."

 OAP_ranger_mechanized_spearhead_desc:0 "A few heavily armored vehicles could punch through enemy lines with ease, cutting them off from reinforcements and allowing our own forces to move in. Tactics such as these will win us any war we fight, ensuring a grand victory at the end of the day."
 
 OAP_ranger_sand_behemoths:0 "Behemoths on a Sandy Sea"
 OAP_ranger_sand_behemoths_desc:0 "Tanks are one of the most fearsome innovations of the Great War. Each one is a metal beast, capable of laying waste to any who get in their way. With a small army of them, we could completely dominate all of our foes."

 oldapplestart.4.t:0 "The Letter of 11"
 oldapplestart.4.d:0 "Groaning, Steel Shackles cupped his head in his hooves as he saw one of his crew enter what could be described as his office. His office was a hybrid between a modern workspace and an ancient torture chamber gone rusty. It could be used for both proper business and less proper 'business' alike. Without saying a single word, the slaver plopped a letter in front of Steel Shackles. It was a simple piece of paper, folded a couple of times and sealed with a bit of bloatsprite wax. On it, a seal with a single L marked its sender. Already, Shackles could feel his blood begin to boil. As the stallion ripped it open, he got up and trotted closer to the slaver who brought the letter. Softly, he mumbled the contents to himself and growled. Charming Luck, one of the merchants, along with some of the softies in the guild were wanting a guarantee from him. Oh, and some of the wimpier slavers, too. Great. Although they were only a total of eleven, they had enough clout that they could cause issues. Furrowing his brow, Shackles reread their demands. They wanted, in writing, guarantees that [RED.GetLeader] would not be given any of their own personal slaves in the case that he requested more than supply could provide. He huffed, and tossed the letter aside. Glancing over at the messenger, he snarled. Before the pony could react, he brought a knife into his hoof and jabbed it forward, the blade sinking into the chest of the pony with a soft squish. As blood dribbled out of the wound, the pony falling to the ground and shivering a bit as the liquid pooled on the floor, Shackles sighed and trotted around to his desk. Eying the dying slaver, he snapped, "That's what you get for bringing the boss bad news!" With a huff, he rested his fetlocks on the desk and ignored the spluttering of his victim. For a moment, the gears turned in his head. At last, he pushed back and grumbled as he trotted out the room..."
 oldapplestart.4.a:0 "Old fools!"

 oldapplestart.5.t:0 "The Farsight Problem"
 oldapplestart.5.d:0 "With a thump, a stack of papers flopped onto the desk of Charming Luck. Grunting, he waved a hoof dismissively at the unicorn that had dropped them off. Outside the small, slightly refurbished room, a cloud of dust was blowing by. Another storm, made even more dangerous primarily by the southern Wasteland being filled with all kinds of balefire radiation. After a moment, he shook his head, checking the report that had been left behind. With a start, he dropped the shipment manifests for his latest caravan and groaned, his heartbeat picked up again. From the top page, he could see what exactly had the aide so flustered. Written in bold ink, a statement from one of the caravan guards for his small coalition of merchants and minor slavers. "General" Farsight had struck again. At least thirty slaves had been liberated, and a good portion of the caravan crew left for dead. Without thinking, he began to fumble in his pocket, touching the sole pre-war bit he owned. He pulled it out briefly, inspecting the shiny golden surface for flaws beyond the few scratches it had when he got it. All he got was the smiling face of Princess Luna. Behind the facade, even though centuries old, he could tell that she was tired, worn, and saddened. Not unlike himself at the moment. For a moment, he stared at the report, its pages taunting him before he finally pushed back and called for his assistant. The Rangers weren't the hardest to find, in fact their base of operations was known to the slavers. It was just a matter of breaching it. Steel Shackles had attempted to deal with it several times, but the defenses of the restored military outpost easily stopped all raids. When his assistant, dressed about as sharply as he was, entered, carrying a few scraps of paper for notes, he cleared his throat and began. "In light of this recent attack, I have come to a conclusion about the Rangers," he began, feeling his chest grow tighter as he continued. "As they can't keep biting into our profits, let the others know that I have decided...""
 oldapplestart.5.a:0 "...to meet with the Ranger-General."
 oldapplestart.5.b:0 "...to deal with the Ranger-General once and for all."
 
 oldapplestart.6.t:0 "The Meeting"
 oldapplestart.6.d:0 ""Let's get down to business," Charming Luck grumbled, motioning to a small table in the center of the warehouse. He glared at Farsight, who likewise was inspecting him with stern eyes. The General's face was obscured by his helmet, but Luck could feel eyes behind the glowing lenses looking back at him. Wordlessly, Farsight sat down in one of the chairs. When Farsight remained quiet, Luck cleared his throat and stated, "I'm offering a deal." He flinched as Farsight laughed once. It was a dry, tired chuckle. "What kind of deal?" Farsight grunted, never changing his expression. Feeling a small surge of confidence, Luck declared, "Old Appleloosa needs a change in management. I'm intending to be that change." He smirked, sending Farsight a calculated look. "I could use further support, and in exchange for yours I could promise... benefits." Farsight remained silent. Luck began to tap his hoof impatiently on the table feeling his heartbeat beginning to rise. Farsight was going to reject his offer, he was sure of it. "What kind of benefits?" Farsight finally inquired, leaning forward and resting his hooves on the table. "You and your Rangers can keep your jobs, and continue playing hero out in the desert." Luck replied, waving a hoof dismissively and inwardly breathing a sigh of relief. Hopefully this would go well now. "And Old Appleloosa can be your prosperous home base. Steel Shackles may grovel and come up with excuses for [RED.GetLeader], but I think they are merely a tool for our economic benefit, and once we're finished with them, we'll simply throw off their influence." With a thump on the table, he pressed himself up and grinned at Farsight. He had got him, for sure. Indeed, Farsight muddled over the proposition. Scrunching his brow, he sighed and looked up at Luck. For a moment, the two locked gazes, and finally Farsight grumbled, "Fine, so long as you keep your end of the bargain." Jumping to his hooves, he grabbed Luck by the lapel of his suit and pulled him close. Luck could smell the stench of his breath, and he gagged. "Otherwise, you won't be in power for long, and I assure you that even the dreaded alicorns, or your own guards will be too slow to save you should I send my Rangers. Got it?" Whimpering, Luck nodded and brushed off his suit as Farsight let him go. As the two walked out of the warehouse, he stopped when he saw his guards huddled in a circle, surrounded by Rangers. They were supposed to provide protection in case things went south. However, it appeared they couldn't handle even basic orders.  "Release them," Farsight snapped, jabbing a hoof at the guards and turning to face Luck. Luck could hear the mirth in Farsights voice, as he gave the order, "Sorry, I couldn't be too careful. You can learn a thing or two living in the desert." With that, he motioned for his Rangers and they galloped off into the dust storm. As the winds whipped at Luck's mane, he glowered at his hired lieutenant."

 oldapplestart.7.d:0 "Eerie reports have begun to come in through our network. The Rangers have seemingly vanished from the city of Old Appleloosa, with all of their known hideouts seeming abandoned. All of our intel says the same thing: Every known Ranger outpost, patrol, and agent has gone missing. Furthermore, our latest inventory check revealed that a large portion of our supplies, arms, and munitions have disappeared. To add to the mystery, any and all routes coming from Last Green have been completely cut off. Our few returning scouts have had little to say beyond reporting that there seems to be a great deal of activity within the known Ranger stronghold of Desert's Gate, with rumors that the settlement has been placed under a heavy lockdown.\n\nThe disappearance of the Rangers, our sudden shortage of supplies, and the region of Last Green being seemingly cut off from our control all point toward a similar conclusion: Old Appleloosa is on the verge of a crisis."

As the situation only grows worse by the day, we are left with little choice but to attempt to suppress this rebellion and restore our authority through force of arms.\n\nAs sister fights sister and the flames of revolution consume the nation, everypony is left wondering who will be the victor in this war..."

 oldapplestart.8.b:0 "The Rangers!"
 
 oldapplestart.9.t:0 "The Quiet Withdrawal"
 oldapplestart.9.d:0 "When our scouts infiltrated Desert's Gate this morning, they found the Rangers gone.\n\nUpon questioning the locals, it seems that the Rangers had packed up all their equipment and supplies in the dead of night, and left northwards without a trace. Reports from other towns seem to confirm that not only the main body of the Rangers, but apparently every single Ranger in our territory has somehow slipped across our admittedly poorly guarded northern border.\n\nThe scouts also described the Ranger Citadel has having been stripped of anything useful, any ammunition either taken with the Rangers or burned in front of the gate. Within the mess hall, the scouts discovered the head of one of our assassins on a pike, having obviously failed in his mission to take out the Ranger-General.\n\nWe suspect that our assassination attempt, combined with the Ranger's undermined military presence, has scared them into deciding to abandon their homes and search for a new land to settle in.\n\nWith the Rangers in full retreat, the biggest threat to our rule has been eliminated and Old Appleloosa has been left more stable than ever before!"
 oldapplestart.9.a:0 "Good riddance."
 
 
 
 oldappleranger.1.t:0 "Start of the Appleloosan Civil War"
 oldappleranger.1.d:0 "Our day of judgment is finally here. News has begun to spread like wildfire throughout not only our beloved state of Appleloosa, but the entirety of the Wasteland: the spirit of Old Appleloosa still burns bright! Throughout all her still enduring settlers and peoples, we have finally managed to officially proclaim our secession from the slaver state, and begin to wage war against the tyrannical rule of Steel Shackles. The evil that has plagued Appleloosa for uncounted years will finally come to an end, being brought to justice by none other than those who have always fight for her freedom. While the reports of our proclamation being sent abroad are quite uplifting to all who hear, our internal populace is still shaken from the chaos that has erupted throughout all the settlements we have barely managed to recently acquire. Commotion has begun to spread throughout our settlements, and despite our careful years of preparation, we are still ill-prepared for the battles that lie ahead. Even though we have successfully managed to acquire our own supplies and munitions for the battles to come, we still lack the bodies needed to match the slavers. Every able-bodied pony that can wield a gun will be sent to the front lines, while those who cannot shall be put to work elsewhere. \n\n We will need every hoof we can get if we are to win this war and finally rescue Appleloosa from the evil that still holds her by a shackle!"

 oldappleranger.2.t:0 "The Day of Judgement"
 oldappleranger.2.d:0 "Old Appleloosa's town square had been used for auctions for longer than anypony could remember. When the weather was fair, slavers would flock there from all across the Wasteland to place their bids. Of course, that hadn't been the case since the rise of the Appleloosan Rangers. With the entire region thrown into chaos, the slave trade was brought to a forcible halt. As the conflict continued, it found itself serving a very different purpose, as it become the site for constant executions. Deserting officers and captured enemies alike were made examples of, left hanging in the wind to remind everypony of the price of treason. These executions only grew more and more frequent as the civil war drew to a close. The fall of the city to the Rangers did not put a halt to this, instead just changing the targets of the executions.\n\n Now, with the bloody conflict brought to an end, an announcement has been made by the victor: There was to be one final series of executions. One final act of justice to be carried out. Attendance was mandatory for everypony who lacked anything better to do, as all were expected to come witness those enemies of liberty face the only fate they deserved.\n\n Near two dozen slavers were dragged out into the town square, clad in the very same chains that they had once used to bind their slaves. Among them were many prominent figures, most notably Steel Shackles himself. Despite being beaten and bloody, the stallion still managed to lift his head up to the sky and march forward with only a slight limp. This show of defiance would win him no favors though, as the gathered audience did little more than spit at him and curse his very name. He would be the first one to be brought before the Ranger-General Farsight, who began to speak to the assembled crowd..."
 oldappleranger.2.a:0 "..."
 
 oldappleranger.2001.t:0 "The Day of Judgement"
 oldappleranger.2001.d:0 "'Ponies of Old Appleloosa. The monsters before you are those slavers who once sought to enslave their fellow pony, who once arrogantly thought themselves so important so as to be allowed to own another life. They have been disabused of that notion, through the strength of our hooves and the resolve of our spirits. Now, the time has come at last for these creatures to face their just dues. For their crimes against both the Goddesses above and against the common decency present in all good folk, they shall all be sentenced to death. To begin with, those minor figures who held onto their twisted practice until the very end.'\n\n At this, a dozen of the slavers were roughly shoved and, in some cases, dragged up to the awaiting gallows. Once they were all in position, ropes tied securely around their necks, Ranger-General Farsight continued.\n\n 'These ponies were not the worst of their ilk. Yet, their crimes are as numerous as the lashings they gave their slaves. They fought in defence of the abominable practice of slavery and both contributed to and directly committed countless abuses against fellow ponies. For their crimes, they shall be sentenced to death by hanging. May they rot in Tartarus.'\n\n At this, a dozen platforms dropped, and a dozen bodies flailed in the open air, before all going limp. The Ranger-General wasted little time before addressing the crowd once more.\n\n 'Next up, those who were in positions of power within our fair nation. Power that they exploited to cause and defend countless atrocities. Yet, their contributions can not be denied. For all their work towards making Old Appleloosa what it is today, we shall extend them a mercy. All they must do is take a shovel and dig, in front of us all, to show humility.'\n\n Confusion was plain on the faces of many of the ponies present, though not a hint of emotion could be seen across any of the Rangers themselves. Every remaining slaver had their chains unlocked, and were offered a shovel to dig with. Most of them hesitantly accepted, while those few who resisted or refused were shot on sight."
 oldappleranger.2001.a:0 "The digging begins."
 
 oldappleranger.2002.t:0 "The Day of Judgement"
 oldappleranger.2002.d:0 "The audience would be forced to sit and watch as those slavers who had once relied on the labor of others to do near everything for them were instead forced to engage in labor themselves for once. They dug and dug some more, with any who slowed being beaten until they continued in their duty. They knew not how deep they had to dig, just that they were to dig one large hole in the center of the square. Ranger-General Farsight looked on impassively as the digging continued, betraying little regarding what was to come next. As the hours ticked by, the hole grew deeper and deeper, until the digging was brought to a halt by the Rangers. The sweat soaked slavers were dragged out of their hole, their shovels confiscated as they were lined up along the lip of the pit they had created. For the first time in hours, Farsight spoke.\n\n 'Do you see now what kind of horrors you subjected your fellow pony to? The struggles of their labor that they were forced to endure for your own selfish interests? That was merely a fraction of what they went through, the smallest hint of the atrocities that you have all committed. For those crimes, you deserve to face fates worth than death. Fortunately for you, I am a stallion of my word. You shall all be given mercy, in the only way that I may allow.'\n\n Rangers began to get into position, guns readied and pointed towards those ponies at the edge of the pit. The reality of the situation came crashing down on the slavers, as any hope they might of had of being spared was utterly crushed. With one final nod from Farsight, gunshots rang out and several bodies fell back into their shared grave. The crowd, formerly dissatisfied with Farsight's 'mercy', engaged in open celebration as the slavers were given their just dues. As the crowd cheered on, several Rangers brought out an iron barrel, from which they poured gasoline all over the bodies. A single match was lit and thrown down into the hole, setting it ablaze and creating a brilliant pyre of flame."

 oldappleranger.2003.d:0 "The flames danced on, as Ranger-General Farsight stood in front of a jubilant crowd. Even many of the Rangers, who had displayed little emotion throughout the day, cheered on the show of justice. However, there was still one more execution to be had. With a stomp of his hoof, Farsight redirected all attention to himself once more.\n\n 'To see those criminals, monsters, and fiends who once oppressed us to be granted their just dues is nothing short of majestic. I doubt I am alone in saying that I have waited a long time to see some of those bodies burn. I trust that they will still be burning by the time they hit Tartarus. However, there is one last execution to take place today. One last monster to be brought before the Goddesses.'\n\n At this, Steel Shackles himself was dragged towards the makeshift pyre. He was firmly held by two Rangers right at the edge, close enough for his fur to be singed by the flames.\n\n 'I don't think the stallion before you needs any introduction. He is nothing short of a monster, a creature who not only belongs in Tartarus but hails from it. His life has been one dedicated to nothing more than inflicting needless pain and suffering upon the good ponies of this world. The blood of countless ponies is on his hooves, and the recent war that tore our nation apart and brought brother against brother is all due to his malicious hatred for liberty. His list of crimes is so long that we would be here all day if I were to read even a portion of them. So, without any further delay, I hereby sentence Steel Shackles to death by fire.'\n\n The slaver in question began to furiously struggle against his bindings and the Rangers holding him. His resistance was met with nothing more than a shove forward, sending him tumbling down into the burning pile of bodies below. His muffled screams could be heard even through the steel bit fastened to him, as he was burned alive. For the first time that day, Ranger-General Farsight smiled."

 oldappleranger.5.d:0 "Our allies in the rock farms to the north have keenly spectated the civil war that recently ravaged the former slaver state of Old Appleloosa. To the surprise of many, the slavers were overthrown by the legendary Appleloosa Rangers, a group far known for their skill in killing the various mutated beasts of the wasteland.\nThis morning, an envoy from the Rangers approached some Hoof City guards, and requested to use the city's radio tower to contact our government.\n It appears that Ranger-General Farsight has decided to join in our dream of creating a new Republic in which all creatures can live in liberty and harmony.\nHis offer to join us in our endeavours has come with a few conditions however:\n\n1: The Rangers will not immediately join or subordinate themselves to our government, however they pledge to give up their independence once they have fully pacified the Appleloosan Desert.\n\n2: While the Rangers agree to the free and open travel of all creatures and currency between our states, they still reserve the right to self-governence in issues of military and legal matters.\n\n3: The Rangers expect us to fund their planned expeditions deeper into the desert, once we have successfully united Azuria. In exchange for these funds, the Rangers will allow our companies unrestricted access to conquered land for purposes of resource extraction, and will support our bureaucrats in integrating the Appleloosans into a proper democratic society.\n\nFrankly, these terms seem more than reasonable, and it never hurts to have another ally in the Wasteland."

 oldappleranger.6.d:0 "The Azurians accepted our proposal!\nFrankly, we didn't expect a different outcome, as the terms we offered them were quite generous and forthcoming. While some doubt still remains in our ranks, about the true motives of this 'Gawdyna Grimfeathers', the optimism with which Farsight had approached this proposal swayed many.\nNo one is 100% sure why Farsight decided to throw hil lot in with the former Talon, but the general consensus is that he is impressed with her dream of a free and democratic Equus, and wishes to make bringing civilization and democracy to the entire southwest his legacy.\n\nFarsight seems to have completely given up on his ambitions for a Grand Appleloosa, instead working towards the grand goal of the fledgeling republic."

In order to show our allegiance to the NCR, as well as to quiet down the last doubters of his alliance with Gawdyna, Ranger-General Farsight has officially announced that the Old Appleloosa Rangers are no more, and all of us shall henceforth be known as the NCR Rangers!\nMany of the former slaves celebrated at that announcement, knowing they finally had a cause worth fighting, and maybe even worth dying for.\n\nBut while the lower ranks celebrated, Farsight and his general staff have already started planning their Great Expedition into the desert, intent on bringing civilization, and to spread the banner of the NCR over the entire southwest."

The slaves that had so foolishly joined the Rangers' rebellion had either been killed in the fighting, or would be publicly worked to death, reconstructing the infrastructure they'd destroyed.\n\nSteel Shackles has announced a lavish party for all his supporters tomorrow, intending to celebrate the victory with a celebration like Old Appleloosa hasn't seen it before.\nSome worry that the beaten Rangers will attempt to rebuild their forces abroad, and one day return to cause trouble again, but for many that is an unfounded worry, seeing as the Rangers are basically destroyed as a force."

 oldapplered.3.t:0 "The Lord of Fillydelphia"
 oldapplered.3.d:0 "As he stepped into the room, Steel Shackle's couldn't help but be disappointed. Wheras the city outside was awe-inspiring, with it's many towering smokestacks and mighty wall surrounding it, Red Eye's office was in comparison uninspiring. Instead of opulence, the room before him was largely bland. Simple grey walls, a simple wooden desk, and no luxuries or decorations. It was certainly not what he expected of the Master of Fillydelphia, and he couldn't help but think of how much nicer his own office was back in Old Appleloosa.\n\n The slaver was snapped out of his thoughts by the very stallion he was here to see. The Master of Fillydelphia, The Scorcher of the Everfree, The Unifier of Sunnyshore. There were many titles to describe him, but the one he most preferred was simply Red Eye.\n\n 'Steel Shackles, I welcome you to my city. It has been some time since we last spoke, has it not? To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?'\n\n As the warlord's glowing red cybernetic eye stared at him, Steel Shackles supressed a shudder. Cybernetics simply weren't natural, and he couldn't help but consider this pony as being unnatural as well. Regardless, he had to remain polite to his benefactor.\n\n 'I am here to request further aid, Master Red Eye. The situation in the south grows more dire by the day. The north grows unstable, troubling rumors come from the south, and we have reason to fear an attack from the east. We are in need of your support.'\n\n Red Eye considered his beneficiaries plight for a moment. Maintaining his allies grip in the south would be ideal, but there were many other pursuits to put his resources towards. After some consideration, he responded..."

In this way, the two Appleloosas may finally be reunified.\n\n Doing this would certainly help out our southern ally, but it could also cause us problems in the future, §Respecially if Old Appleloosa tries to betray us down the line.§! So the question that must then be asked is simple: Do we trust them with more land and power?"

 oldapplered.7.d:0 "Steel Shackles knew this day would come. The Heartland's had been secured and Red Eyes forces reigned supreme across the land. The partnership we once enjoyed with Fillydelphia has come to an end, made irrelevant by our purpose being fulfilled. In it's place, a simple offer has been given: Submit to Fillydelphia as their most loyal of subjects or face their wrath. Would this be it? Would Steel Shackles end his career as nothing more than Red Eye's puppet, groveling beneath his hooves as if he were a slave? Or would he dare to resist, to stand up and fight against his fate? The choice was there before him, but he had to reach his decision quickly, unless he wished to invoke Red Eye's wrath regardless."

Though he had spent his whole life in the lap of luxury, he never could of hoped for even half of what he held now. An entire empire, stretching across the Heartlands! More wealth, resources, and slaves than he knew what to do with! All of it, his!\n\n Those slavers of Fillydelphia who survived their war had even been more than willing to join his side. With even more benefits and privileges than they enjoyed under Red Eye, they were all too happy to get to work. Cousin Chainlink also proved to be a great help in this, helping Steel Shackles promote only those slavers who could be trusted to remain loyal to his rule.\n\n The future was truly a bright one for Old Appleloosa and for all slavers from it. They would be enjoying endless wealth and prosperity within the world of their invention. And they had Steel Shackles to thank for all of it."

If she failed, well...\n\n A bullet impacted a rock to her right, prompting her to move even faster. These masters were by far some of the most sadistic she had ever known, hunting her and many other slaves for sport. Unfortunately, she knew that she had no hope of making it to the border in this condition. Ducking behind a nearby tree, she allowed her legs to fail. From the ground, she hoped to regain her breath before continuing the mad dash.\n\n What she did not know was that one of her hunters was much much closer than she had known. She would never see him, with her last memory being of a gunshot from her left. Her death would be just one of many that day, as no slave would be fast enough to escape pursuit."

 oldappleloosa.3.d:0 "Steel Shackles found that Old Appleloosa looked very different from this perspective. As the noose was placed around his neck, he could find little comfort in the cold glares of the ponies gathered to spectate. He could hardly believe he had once considered these ponies to be respectable slavers, his peers within that most noble of businesses. However, they had all taken off their masks and revealed themselves to be little more than traitors and crooks. Even Golden Shackles was among them! To think, his own family betraying him!\n\n As the list of crimes being read off reached its end, Charming Luck stepped out in front of the soon-to-be-dead slaver. That disgusting face stared at him with a smug grin, taunting him by asking for his last words. All he would get in response was a glob of spit launched at his traitorous muzzle.\n\n Wiping off the offending spit, Charming Luck stepped back and gave a simple nod to the executioner. With Steel Shackles dying before him and all of his supporters sentencd to exile, there were few left to oppose the new regime."

Unfortunately, the element of surprise quickly wore off, and many militias from across the Rock Farmer's territory were rallied to oppose us. Their attempted counter-attack has already inflicted some casualties on our forces, though we did manage to hold our land. The question now is whether or not to fortify in preparation for yet another counter-attack or to push forward before they can regroup. The former would be the safer bet, but the later could allow us to seize even more land."

Their new management has proven to be far more amibtious than their predecessors ever were, seeking to return to their traditional ways while empowering their nation. We have long since suspected that they would become a threat to our own reign, but we were caught unprepared by their offer to us.\n\nRather than seeking to conquer our nation, Old Appleloosa has instead purposed that we cooperate. At very least, they would like to create a trade deal between our two nations that we can both profit off of. However, they have also proposed the idea of going even further than that and creating a proper alliance.\n\n Though there are many benefits to such an arrangement, we must also be mindful of the possibility of getting tangled in their affairs. Should we accept their proposal and, if so, to what extent?"

Unfortunately, this news reached Charming Luck at the same time, and now a full on coup was underway. Slavers all across the city were out hunting for their former leader, either to rally around him or kill him.\n\n Turning a corner, Steel Shackles was met with the barrel of a rifle pointed at his face. Scrambling back and ignoring the orders to halt, he tried to return the way he came only to find a griffon mercenary blocking his path. Looking between the two rapidly approaching aggressors, he tried to pull out his knife. If he was going to die here today, he would at very least die fighting. However, all thoughts of resistance were blown out of his mind when a hole was similarly blown through his leg by a high caliber round. Collapsing into the dirt below, he could do nothing as the slaver and mercenary debated whether to kill him or bring him in, before agreeing on the later and dragging him away."

Sandbags, barricades, and makeshift fortifications alike all surrounded and filled his home. These measures, which would of been considered just a week ago to be alarmist, were currently being put to the test as the building found itself under siege. Word had traveled to Old Appleloosa that Red Eye has died. Unfortunately, this news had led to the Appleloosan Rangers launching a coup against the government. They and their surprisingly large amount of supporters have risen up all across the country, fighting with our slavers in every settlement we control.\n\n Though the coup has come as a complete surprise, the attack within our own capital came as an even greater surprise. A small army of Rangers seemingly came out of nowhere and attempted to put an end to Steel Shackles himself early this morning. Since then, the effort to hold them off and defend the rightful leader of Old Appleloosa has grown increasingly desperate.\n\n The slavers makeshift fort would finally fall due to a makeshift explosion blowing a hole through the east wings barricade. As dozens of Rangers rushed in through their breach, many of the defending slavers would surrender on the spot. Steel Shackles himself was found attempting to leave through a tunnel leading out of his cellar and was quickly apprehended after a brief firefight."

His family connections are vast, and his wealth even vaster, with many considering him to be one of the most powerful stallions in all of the south.\n\nThe rise of Red Eye to the north has resulted in the slaver leader becoming known for his pro-Fillydelphia views. As his relationship with the highly industrialized city has grown, so too as his wealth. A fact that is well known by most other slavers, with many beginning to resent him for it.\n\nAs Old Appleloosa enters a time of rapid change and upheaval, it will fall to Steel Shackles to keep the peace. It remains to be seen if he is a strong enough leader to steer his nation through these challenging times."

His support across the government is unanimous, and even the Appleloosan Rangers are willing to give him their begruding approval.\n\nHe'll need all of this support too, as he works towards restoring Appleloosan pride and building a prosperous southern empire."
