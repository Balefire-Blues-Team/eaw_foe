### Opening Focuses ###

 OAP_opening_1:0 "Under the Scorching Sun"
 OAP_opening_1_desc:0 "The wasteland we inherited from old Equestria is quite different compared to the rest of the Wasteland. The land of scorching sun has decided to call nopony except us."
 
 OAP_opening_2:0 "In the Land of Sand and Profit"
 OAP_opening_2_desc:0 " What fools see as an inhospitable desert, we see as an oasis of opportunity, with its sands offering boundless profit to those daring enough to reap from it."
 
 OAP_opening_3:0 "An Offer We Couldn't Refuse"
 OAP_opening_3_desc:0 "While not many look to our region as an opportunity for investment, one certain charismatic stallion from across the Wastes has turned his eyes towards our humid nation.."
 
 OAP_economic_reshuffle:0 "Economic Reshuffle"
 OAP_economic_reshuffle_desc:0 "The strength of our economy is at the worst it's ever been. If we are to prosper, or at least change, we must take our economy into a new direction. The question of course lies in where?"
 
 OAP_investements_from_RED:0 "Investments from Fillydelphia"
 OAP_investements_from_RED_desc:0 "Luckily for us, our connections with Red Eye and his slavers can grant us the push our economy so desperately needs, even if others dislike the idea of seeking investments from outside our borders."
 
 OAP_import_heavy_industry:0 "Import Heavy Machinery"
 OAP_import_heavy_industry_desc:0 "One thing we could definitely use more of is some good old fashioned machinery, and while Appleloosa lacks the industry to produce her own, our trading opportunities with Fillydelphia can provide us with the spinning cogs we need."
 
 OAP_homegrown_industry:0 "Focus on Civilian Industry"
 OAP_homegrown_industry_desc:0 "Local investments into our own economy can be lucrative if we know where to focus. Our civilian sector is a safe option, even if it means repurposing our older wartime factories into more modern, versatile ones."
 
 OAP_subsidize_merchants:0 "Subsidize Local Merchants"
 OAP_subsidize_merchants_desc:0 "One surefire way to boost the flow of caps throughout Appleloosa is to simply invest in our local merchants and arms dealers. Subsidizing our merchants can only strengthen our civilian industry while ensuring the stability of our political influence."
 
 OAP_farming_desert:0 "Cacti-Farms in the Desert"
 OAP_farming_desert_desc:0 "Of course, strengthening our economy in all possible sectors includes seeking opportunities in our own lands. We would be wise to exploit our unending deserts and grow our own cacti-farms, native only to the deserts of Appleloosa herself."
 
 OAP_fillydelphian_model:0 "The Fillydelphian Model"
 OAP_fillydelphian_model_desc:0 "While many would call it cruel, the Fillydelphian model of Wasteland economics is nothing if not efficient. While focusing most slaves into the heavy-industry sector would present a problem during wartime should such industrial centres be captured, our industrial growth during peacetime would skyrocket!"
 
 OAP_like_old_times:0 "Like the Good Old Times"
 OAP_like_old_times_desc:0 "Heavy industry is nice and all, but the near-mythical Mixie Way of life demands a more rural approach to slavery. Wealthy merchants and plantation-owners control their slaves directly and use them to farm the land or extract the resources we need. We should return to those old values, lest we be doomed by Red Eye's ideas."
 
 OAP_currency_control_issue:0 "Delay Inflation"
 OAP_currency_control_issue_desc:0 "The value of our caps is headed nowhere but deep beneath our sands. While tackling our inflation is a long-term process, implementing immediate relief measures can definitely slow its progress."
 
 OAP_fasttrack_reform:0 "Fasttrack our Industry"
 OAP_fasttrack_reform_desc:0 "We need to industrialize, and we need to do it fast!\nMany in our country will disapprove seeing their way of life threatened, and the Rangers will undoubtedly use this as an excuse to recruit, but this is the best option we have."
 
 OAP_charmings_proposal:0 "Charming Luck's Proposal"
 OAP_charmings_proposal_desc:0 "Interesting… a letter from Charming Luck has been presented to me, what could he want?"
 
 OAP_bandaid_braindrain:0 "A Band-Aid for the Brain-Drain"
 OAP_bandaid_braindrain_desc:0 "Our technological literacy is abysma,l and if nothing is done to fix it in time, not even our smartest ponies will be able to rescue Appleloosa from another dark age. We must reform our research methods and implement a proper scientific method."
 
 OAP_safe_reforms:0 "Safe Reforms"
 OAP_safe_reforms_desc:0 "While change is desperately needed to drag our economy out of the sands, unsafe and extreme changes only have the harm of damaging our economy even further. Implementing safer reforms will pull ourselves out of the sands and make sure we don't shoot ourselves in the hoof while doing so."
 
 OAP_ask_RED_help:0 "Request Fillydelphian Aid"
 OAP_ask_RED_help_desc:0 "Aligning ourselves with Fillydephia's sphere has already proven wonders for boosting our own industrial capacity. Requesting more aid would only speed this process even more!"
 
 OAP_learn_from_azuria:0 "Learn from Azuria"
 OAP_learn_from_azuria_desc:0 "Shattered Hoof has managed to resist the pull of Red Eye despite his best efforts, and the other Azurian nations sure seem to follow that trend. We should learn from them and undermine Red Eye in our own nation as well."
 
 OAP_deal_with_farsight:0 "Deal with Farsight"
 OAP_deal_with_farsight_desc:0 "Farsight has remained as a priority target for far too long, it's about time we do something about this troublesome ranger..."
 
 OAP_most_loyal_servant:0 "His Most Loyal Servant"
 OAP_most_loyal_servant_desc:0 "Red Eye and his slavers have already proven themselves to be the de facto powerhouse of the wastes. Their prowess at maintaining such a large slaver empire is unquestionable, it only makes sense for Appleloosa to follow in his steps."
 
 OAP_return_to_tradition:0 "Returning to Tradition"
 OAP_return_to_tradition_desc:0 "Appleloosa has spent far too long tied to her shackles, blood needlessly dripping from her innumerable slaves toiling away at a meaningless future that awards nopony but the maniacal. At last, we have the opportunity to resurface our traditions!"
 
 OAP_appleloosan_army:0 "A New Appleloosan Defense Force"
 OAP_appleloosan_army_desc:0 "An entirely new military shall be formed, made up of none but sun-scorched ponies who call these deserts home. Appleloosa only deserves the best to defend her sands."
 
 OAP_ranger_army:0 "Let the Rangers keep their Positions"
 OAP_ranger_army_desc:0 "The Rangers, while relentlessly proving themselves to be a nuisance, can no doubt be mistaken for their combat prowess and unparalleled skill in desert operations. Perhaps it would be better if we were to leave them alone..."
 
 OAP_doctrinal_thought:0 "Doctrinal Thought"
 OAP_doctrinal_thought_desc:0 "Advancing our military thought involves implementing a proper doctrine, and our generals may have the right idea on where to properly innovate."
 
 OAP_expand_spec_ops:0 "Special Forces Program"
 OAP_expand_spec_ops_desc:0 "While we are quite used to training on our own deserts, it's quite clear our numbers will never match those of larger powers. Small, focused elite units specialized in specific areas might be just what we need to overcome any threat."
 
 OAP_buy_big_guns:0 "Buy Weapon-Blueprints"
 OAP_buy_big_guns_desc:0 "Focusing on quality requires us to upgrade our weaponry, and developing these weapons at home requires our very own blueprints. Acquiring these blueprints should be our next priority."
 
 OAP_train_up_masses:0 "Train up the Masses"
 OAP_train_up_masses_desc:0 "While not many reside within our borders, there are still many still eager to fight for Appleloosa. All we need is a proper recruitment wave to bolster our ranks."
 
 OAP_buy_many_guns:0 "Buy Guns in Bulk"
 OAP_buy_many_guns_desc:0 "No soldier is useful without their own gun. Why not put our caps to use and acquire some weaponry for our loyal soldiers?"

 OAP_power_cemented:0 "Power Reaffirmed"

Already we have seen an increase in the number of slaves coming from Appleloosa, and with the nexus of the Equestrian slave trade now under our command, we can expect that to grow even more."

 oldapplestart.4.d:0 "Groaning, Steel Shackles cupped his head in his hooves as he saw one his crew enter the what could be described as his office. It was an office so long as the decor was ancient Equestrian torture chamber gone rusty. Without a word, the slaver plopped a letter in front of Steel Shackles. It was a simple piece of paper, folded a couple of times and sealed with a bit of bloatsprite wax. On it, a seal with a single L on it. Already, Shackles could feel his blood begin to boil. As Shackles ripped it open, he got up and trotted closer to the slaver who brought the letter. Softly, he mumbled the contents to himself and he growled. Charming Luck, one of the merchants, along with some of the softies in the guild were wanting a guarantee from him. Oh, and some of the wimpier slavers, too. Great. Although they were only a total of eleven, they had enough clout that they could cause issues. Furrowing his brow, Shackles reread their demands. They wanted, in writing, guarantees that Red Eye would not be given any of their own personal slaves in the case that he requested more than supply could provide. He huffed, and tossed the letter aside. Glancing over at the messenger, he snarled. Before the pony could react, he brought a knife into his hoof and jabbed it forward, the blade sinking into the chest of the pony with a soft squish. As blood dribbled out of the wound, the pony falling to the ground and shivering a bit as the liquid pooled on the floor, Shackles sighed and trotted around to his desk. Eying the dying slaver, he snapped, "That's what you get for bringing the boss bad news!" With a huff, he rested his fetlocks on the desk and ignored the spluttering of his victim. For a moment, the gears turned in his head. At last, he pushed back and grumbled as he trotted out the room..."

 oldapplestart.5.d:0 "With a thump, a stack of papers flopped onto the desk of Charming Luck. Grunting, he waved a hoof dismissively at the unicorn that had dropped them off. Outside the small, slightly refurbished room, a cloud of dust was blowing by. Another storm thanks to the wastes south being filled with all kinds of balefire radiation. After a moment, he shook his head, checking the report that had been left behind. With a start, he dropped the shipment manifests for his latest caravan and groaned. His heartbeat picked up again. From the top page, he could see what exactly had the aide so flustered. Written in bold ink, a statement from one of the caravan guards for his small coalition of merchants and minor slavers. "General" Farsight had struck again. At least thirty slaves had been liberated, and a good portion of the caravan crew left for dead. Without thinking, he began to fumble in his pocket, touching the sole pre-war bit he owned. He pulled it out briefly, inspecting the shiny golden surface for flaws beyond the few scratches it had when he got it. All he got was the smiling face of Princess Luna. Behind the facade, even though centuries old, he could tell that she was tired, worn, and saddened. Not unlike himself at the moment. For a moment, he stared at the report, its pages taunting him before he finally pushed back and called for his assistant. The rangers weren't the hardest to find, in fact their base of operations was known to the slavers. It was just a matter of breaching it. Steel Shackles had attempted to attack, but the defenses of the restored military outpost easily stopped all raids. When his assistant, dressed about as sharply as he was, entered, carrying a few scraps of paper for notes, he cleared his throat and began. "In light of this recent attack, I have come to a conclusion about the rangers," he began, feeling his chest grow tighter as he continued. "As they can't keep biting into our profits, let the others know that I have decided...""

 oldapplestart.6.t:0 "The Meeting"
 oldapplestart.6.d:0 ""Let's get down do business," Charming Luck grumbled, motioning to a small table in the center of the warehouse. He glared at Farsight, who likewise was inspecting him with stern Eyes. The General's face was obscured by his Ranger Helmet, but Luck could feel eyes behind the glowing lenses looking back at him. Wordlessly, Farsight sat down in one of the chairs. When Farsight remained quiet, Luck cleared his throat and stated, "I'm offering a deal." He flinched as Farsight laughed once. It was a dry, tired chuckle. "What kind of deal?" Farsight grunted, never changing his expression. Feeling a small surge of confidence, Luck declared, "Old Appleloosa needs a change in management. I'm intending to be that change." He smirked, sending Farsight a calculated look. "I could use further support, and in exchange for yours I could promise... benefits." Farsight remained silent. Luck began to tap his hoof impatiently on the table feeling his heartbeat beginning to rise. Farsight was going to reject his offer, he was sure of it. "What kind of benefits?" Farsight finally inquired, leaning forward and resting his hooves on the table. "You and your Rangers can keep your jobs, and continue playing Hero out in the desert." Luck replied, waving a hoof dismissively and inwardly breathing a sigh of relief. Hopefully this would go well now. "And Old Appleloosa can be your prosperous home base. Steel Shackles may grovel and come up with excuses for Red Eye, but I think RedEye is merely a tool for our economic benefit, and once we're finished with him, we'll simply trow off his influence." With a thump on the table, he pressed himself up and grinned at Farsight. He had got him, for sure. Indeed, Farsight muddled over the proposition. Scrunching his brow, he sighed and looked up at Luck. For a moment, the two locked gazes, and finally Farsight grumbled, "Fine, so long as you keep your end of the bargain." Jumping to his hooves, he grabbed Luck by the lapel of his suit and pulled him close. Luck could smell the stench of his breath, and he gagged. "Otherwise, you won't be in power for long, and I assure you that even Red Eye's Alicorns, or your own guards will be too slow to save you should I send my Rangers, got it?" Whimpering, Luck nodded and brushed off his suit as Farsight let him go. As the two walked out of the warehouse, he stopped when he saw his guards huddled in a circle, surrounded by rangers. They were supposed to provide protection in case things went south. However, it appeared they couldn't handle even basic orders.  "Release them," Farsight snapped, jabbing a hoof at the guards and turning to face Luck. Luck could hear the mirth in Farsights voice, as he gave the order, "Sorry, I couldn't be too careful. You can learn a thing or two living in the desert." With that, he motioned for his rangers and they galloped off into the dust storm. As the winds whipped at Luck's mane, he glowered at his hired lieutenant."

Furthermore, our latest inventory check revealed that a large portion of our supplies, arms and munitions has disappeared, as quickly gone as our trace on the Rangers. Any routes coming from Last Green have been completely cut off, and our few returning scouts not having much to say other than the intense amount of culmination near Desert's Gate, with rumors that the settlement has been placed under a heavy lockdown.\n\n The disappearance of the Rangers, our sudden shortage of supplies and the region of Last Green being seemingly cut off from our autonomy, it doesn't even take a fool to know what awaits Appleloosa.."

Within the Mess-Hall the Scouts discovered the Head of our Assassin on a spike, Having obviously failed his mission.\nWe suspect that while our assassin failed, the attempt, combined with the poor military presence the Rangers had, led to them deciding to Abandon their homes and search for a new land to settle in.\n With this, the biggest threat to our rule has been Eliminated, and a Stable Appleloosa can finally be accomplished!"

News has begun to spread like wildfire throughout not only our beloved state of Appleloosa, but the entirety of the Wasteland: the spirit of Old Appleloosa still burns bright! Throughout all her still enduring settlers and peoples, we have finally managed to officially proclaim our secession from the Slaver state, and begin to wage war against the tyrannical rule of Steel Shackles. The evil that has plagued Appleloosa for uncounted years will finally come to an end, being brought to justice by none other but those who will fight for her freedom. While the reports of our proclamation being sent abroad are quite uplifting to all who hear, our internal populace is still shaken from the chaos that has erupted throughout all the settlements we have barely managed to recently acquire. Commotion has begun to spread throughout our settlements, and despite our careful years of preparation, we are still ill-prepared for the battles that lie ahead. Even though we have successfully managed to acquire our own supplies and munitions for the battles to come, we still lack the bodies needed to match the Slavers. Every able-bodied pony that can wield a gun will be sent to the front lines, while those who cannot shall be put to work elsewhere. \n\n We will need every hoof we can get if we are to win this war and finally rescue Appleloosa from the evil that still holds her by a shackle!"

 oldappleranger.2.d:0 "Old Appleloosa's town square had been used for auctions for longer than anypony could remember. When the weather was fair, slavers would flock there from all across the Wasteland to place their bids. Of course, that hadn't been the case since the rise of the Appleloosan Rangers. With the entire region thrown into chaos, the slave trade was brought to a forcible halt. As the conflict continued, it found itself serving a very different purpose, as it become the site for constant executions. Deserting officers and captured enemies alike were made examples of, left hanging in the wind to remind everypony of the price of treason. These executions only grew more and more frequent as the civil war drew to a close. The fall of the city to the Rangers did not put a halt to this, instead just changing the targets of the executions.\n\n Now, with the bloody conflict brough to an end, an announcement has been made by the victor: There was to be one final series of executions. One final act of justice to be carried out. Attendance was mandatory for everypony who lacked anything better to do, as all were expected to come witness those enemies of liberty face the only fate they deserved.\n\n Near two dozen slavers were dragged out into the town square, clad in the very same chains that they had once used to bind their slaves. Among them were many prominent figures, most notably Steel Shackles himself. Despite being beaten and bloody, the stallion still managed to lift his head up to the sky and march forward with only a slight limp. This show of defiance would win him no favors though, as the gathered audience did little more than spit at him and curse his very name. He would be the first one to be brought before the Ranger-General Farsight, who began to speak to the assembled crowd..."

 oldappleranger.2001.d:0 "'Ponies of Old Appleloosa. The monsters before you are those slavers who once sought to enslave their fellow pony, who once arrogantly thought themselves so important so as to be allowed to own another life. They have been disabused of that notion, through the strength of our hooves and the resolve of our spirits. Now, the time has come at last for these creatures to face their just dues. For their crimes against both the Goddesses above and against the common decency present in all good folk, they shall all be sentenced to death. To begin with, those minor figures who held onto their twisted practice until the very end.'\n\n At this, a dozen of the slavers were roughly shoved and, in some cases, dragged up to the awaiting gallows. Once they were all in position, ropes tied securely around their necks, Ranger-General Farsight continued.\n\n 'These ponies were not the worst of their ilk. Yet, their crimes are as numerous as the lashings they gave their slaves. They fought in defence of the abominable practice of slavery and both contributed to and directly committed countless abuses against fellow ponies. For their crimes, they shall be sentenced to death by hanging. May they rot in Tartarus.'\n\n At this, a dozen platforms dropped, and a dozen bodies flailed in the open air, before all going limp. The Ranger-General wasted little time before addressing the crowd once more.\n\n 'Next up, those who were in positions of power within our fair nation. Power that they exploited to cause and defend countless attrocities. Yet, their contributions can not be denied. For all their work towards making Old Appleloosa what it is today, we shall extend them a mercy. All they must do is take a shovel and dig, in front of us all, to show humility.'\n\n Confusion was plain on the faces of many of the ponies present, though not a hint of emotion could be seen across any of the Rangers themselves. Every remaining slaver had their chains unlocked, and were offered a shovel to dig with. Most of them hesitantly accepted, while those few who resisted or refused were shot on sight."
 oldappleranger.2001.a:0 "The digging begins."
 
 oldappleranger.2002.t:0 "The Day of Judgement"
 oldappleranger.2002.d:0 "The audience would be forced to sit and watch as those slavers who had once relied on the labor of others to do near everything for them were instead forced to engage in labor themselves for once. They dug and dug some more, with any who slowed being beaten until they continued in their duty. They knew not how deep they had to dig, just that they were to dig one large hole in the center of the square. Ranger-General Farsight looked on impassively as the digging continued, betraying little regarding what was to come next. As the hours ticked by, the hole grew deeper and deeper, until the digging was brought to a halt by the Rangers. The sweat soaked slavers were dragged out of their hole, their shovels confiscated as they were lined up along the lip of the pit they had created. For the first time in hours, Farsight spoke.\n\n 'Do you see now what kind of horrors you subjected your fellow pony to? The struggles of their labor that they were forced to endure for your own selfish interests? That was merely a fraction of what they went through, the smallest hint of the attrocities that you have all committed. For those crimes, you deserve to face fates worth than death. Fortunately for you, I am a stallion of my word. You shall all be given mercy, in the only way that I may allow.'\n\n Rangers began to get into position, guns readied and pointed towards those ponies at the edge of the pit. The reality of the situation came crashing down on the slavers, as any hope they might of had of being spared was utterly crushed. With one final nod from Farsight, gunshots rang out and several bodies fell back into their shared grave. The crowd, formerly disatisfied with Farsight's 'mercy', engaged in open celebration as the slavers were given their just dues. As the crowd cheered on, several Rangers brought out an iron barrel, from which they poured gasoline all over the bodies. A single match was lit and thrown down into the hole, setting it ablaze and creating a brilliant pyre of flame."

Even many of the Rangers, who had displayed little emotion throughout the day, cheered on the show of justice. However, there was still one more execution to be had. With a stomp of his hoof, Farsight redirected all attention to himself once more.\n\n 'To see those criminals, monsters, and fiends who once oppressed us to be granted their just dues is nothing short of majestic. I doubt I am alone in saying that I have waited a long time to see some of those bodies burn. I trust that they will still be burning by the time they hit Tartarus. However, there is one last execution to take place today. One last monster to be brought before the Goddesses.'\n\n At this, Steel Shackles himself was dragged towards the makeshift pyre. He was firmly held by two Rangers right at the edge, close enough for his fur to be singed by the flames.\n\n 'I don't think the stallion before you needs any introduction. He is nothing short of a monster, a creature who not only belongs in Tartarus but hails from it. His life has been one dedicated to nothing more than inflicting needless pain and suffering upon the good ponies of this world. The blood of countless ponies is on his hooves, and the recent war that tore our nation apart and brought brother against brother is all due to his malicious hatred for liberty. His list of crimes is so long that we would be here all day if I were to read even a portion of them. So, without any further delay, I hereby sentence Steel Shackles to death by fire.'\n\n The slaver in question began to furiously struggle against his bindings and the Rangers holding him. His resistance was met with nothing more than a shove forward, sending him tumbling down into the burning pile of bodies below. His muffled screams could be heard even through the steel bit fastened to him, as he was burned alive. For the first time that day, Ranger-General Farsight smiled."
