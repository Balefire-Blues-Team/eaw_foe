 oldappleloosa.1.desc:0 "After the debacle that ended with the last \"Overseer\" Red Eye sent being crushed by a train car, he has sent another. This alicorn, who has requested that we refer to her has \"Consequtia\", has already proven to be a much more ruthless overseer than the last; A feat most thought to be impossible. She has already killed Steel Shackles for her failure to capture the ones responisble for her sister's death, and has now taken direct control over Old Appleloosa, putting us under Red Eye's direct control."

 oldappleloosa.2.title:0 "Securing Old Appleloosa"
 oldappleloosa.2.desc:0 "We have received word from Consequtia, the alicorn we sent to oversee our interests in Old Appleloosa, that she has settled in nicely. In even better news, it seems that the former leader of the slavers there, Steel Shackles, will no longer be a hinderance to our vision. Already we have seen an increase in the number of slaves coming from Appleloosa, and with the nexus of the Equestrian slave trade now under our command, we can expect that to grow even more."

 oldapplestart.3.d:0 "WIP\nExplains that RedEye made an offer to us, wherein he buys all slaves we get from the southwest at above-market rate, in exchange for giving him exclusive buying-rights, and supporting Reds ambition in the Appleloosan Area.\nWe gained a lot of caps from it, but what did RedEye offer to sweeten the deal?"

 oldapplestart.4.d:0 "WIP\n11 of the most prominent merchants and slavers, first among them Chraming Luck, who are not of Shackles inner circle have sent a message to him. They want a guarrantee that no personal slaves be siezed from them in the event that RedEye demands more, and furthermore wish that steps be taken towards a more financially independant Old Appleloosa."

 oldapplestart.7.t:0 "Total Silence"
 oldapplestart.7.d:0 "WIP\nThe Rangers seem to have vanished from the face of Equus, and quite a lot of guns and supplies have vanished with them.

 oldapplestart.9.d:0 "When our Scouts infiltrated Desert's Gate this morning, they found the Rangers gone.\nUpon questioning the Locals, it seems that the Rangers had packed up all their Equipment and supplies in the dead of night, and left northwards without a trace. Reports from other towns seem to confirm that not only the main body of the Rangers, but apparently every single Ranger in our territory has somehow slipped across our admittedly poorly guarded northern Border.\nThe Scout-Report described the Ranger Citadel stripped of anything useful, any ammunition either taken with the Rangers or burned in front of the Gates. Within the Mess-Hall the Scouts discovered the Head of our Assassin on a spike, Having obviously failed his mission.\nWe suspect that while our assassin failed, the attempt, combined with the poor military presence the Rangers had, led to them deciding to Abandon their homes and search for a new land to settle in.\n With this, the biggest threat to our rule has been Eliminated, and a Stable Appleloosa can finally be accomplished!"
 oldapplestart.9.a:0 "Good Riddance"
 
 
 oldappleranger.1.t:0 "Start of the Appleloosan Civil War"
 oldappleranger.1.d:0 "WIP"
 oldappleranger.1.a:0 "Call up everyone!"
 
 oldappleranger.2.t:0 "The Day of Judgement"
 oldappleranger.2.d:0 "WIP\nThe Rangers parade all the supporters of Steel Shackles, and the pony himself through the streets of Old Appleloosa, before leading them to the central Square. There, They are ceremonially led before Ranger-General Farsight, who reads out a list of their crimes against old Appleloosa and the Rangers, be they real or imagined, before condemming each of them to death. All Citizens of the City are out to watch, as Farsight mandated that not showing up to the Judegemnts was tantamount to treason. After all but Shackles himself had their judgement read out, they are lead towards a nearby ditch, where they are shot in groups of five. after they are dead, Farsight reads the judgement for Shackles, going on for nearly half an hour, before Shackles too is led to the Ditch and Shot by Farsight himself. Some rangers then dump Gasoline into the ditch and all the bodies are burnt."

 oldappleranger.3.d:0 "News that Steel Shackles, RedEye's loyal follower in Old Appleloosa, had lost to the so called 'Old Appleloosa Rangers' had barely grown old, as a second, even more concerning message arrived:\n§BIn the name of Ranger-General Farsight of the Old Appleloosa Rangers, Slavery is officially abolished and outlawed both for Citizens of Old Appleloosa, as well as throughout its entire territory for non-citizens.\nAll Ponies currently classified as 'Slaves' are to report to the nearest Ranger in order to be reassigned to a new Purpose.§!\nOur Contacts in Old Appleloosa have all either gone quiet or fled the country, as anyone with overt allegiance to RedEye is being arrested by Ranger-Patrols.\nWith this, we lose a major source of slaves, as well as access to the slave-markets of the Southwest, but its not a crippling blow.\nIn time, we shall conquer Old Appleloosa much like the rest of the Wastes, and show this 'Farsight' how wrong he was to oppose us..."
 oldappleranger.3.a:0 "He won't stand against us for long..."
 
 oldappleranger.4.t:0 "Opening of the Ranger HQ"
 oldappleranger.4.d:0 "Today, in a massive Ceremony, Ranger-General Farsight has officially declared the newly finished Ranger-HQ as the new Capital, with Old Appleloosa being demoted to just another city in the Nation.\nTo show the movement of leadership, a military parade was held, where the Soldiers symbolically left their barracks in old Appleloosa and marched down all the way to their new Home.\n Already thousands of ponies from the entire nation, but especially the old capital have relocated to the Fortress-City, as the government will need many laborers to keep such a massive construction maintained, and the gears of governance turning.\nMany in the higher ranks of the Rangers are confident that the new HQ is near-impregnable to conventional attacks, and could even weather another megaspell-apocalypse, should such a Calamity ever befall us.\nA New Dawn has arrived in Aplleloosa, and we shall be the ones to spread its message:\n\n§RGlory to Farsight!\nGlory to the Rangers!§!"

 oldappleranger.5.t:0 "An Envoy from Old Appleloosa"
 oldappleranger.5.d:0 "Our Allies in the Rock-Farmes have keenly spectated the Civil war that recently ravaged the former Slave-State of Old Appleloosa. To the Surprise of many, the Slavers were overthrown by the legendary Appeloosa Rangers, a group far known for their skill in killing the various mutated beasts of the wasteland.\nThis morning, an Envoy from the Rangers approached some Hoof-City Guards, and requested to use the City's radio-tower to contact our Government.\n It appears that Ranger General Farsight has decided to join in our Dream of creating a new Republic in which all creatures can live in liberty and harmony.\nHis offer to join us in our endeavours has come with a few conditions however:\n\n1: The Rangers will not immediatly join or subordinate themselves to our Government, however they pledge to give up their independence once they have fully pacified the Appleloosan Desert.\n\n2: While the Rangers agree to free flow of Creatures and currency between our states, they still reserve the right to self-governence in issues of Military and Legal Matters.\n\n3: The Rangers Expect us to fund their planned expeditions deeper into the desert, once we have Sucessfully united Azuria. In exchange for these funds, the Rangers will allow our Companies unrestricted access to conquered land for purposes of Extraction, and will support our bueraucrats in integrating the Appleloosans into a proper democratic Society.\n\nFrankly, these terms seem more than reasonable, and it never hurts to have another Ally in the Wasteland."
 oldappleranger.5.a:0 "Tell them we accept."
 
 oldappleranger.6.t:0 "The Azurian Response"
 oldappleranger.6.d:0 "The Azurians accepted our Proposal!\nFrankly, we didn't expect a different outcome, as the terms we offered them were quite generous and forthcoming. While some doubt still remains in our ranks, about the true motives of this 'Gawdyna Grimfeathers', the Optimism with which Farsight had approached this proposal swayed many.\nNo-one is 100% sure why Farsight decided to throw hil lot in with the former Talon, but the general consensus is that he is impressed with her dream of a free and Democratic Equus, and wishes to make bringing civilization and Democracy to the Entire Southwest his Legacy.\n\nFarsight seems to have completely given up on his ambitions for a Grande-Appleloosa, instead working towards the Grander goal of the Fledgeling Republic."
 oldappleranger.6.a:0 "He found something to fight for."
 
 oldappleranger.7.t:0 "The Birth of Hope"
 oldappleranger.7.d:0 "Today is a Grand day for all of Equus:\nA new Beacon of Hope shines upon the Wasteland, as nations all across Azura have come together to found the New Canterlot Republic!\nWith this massive step taken, the Dream of Gawdyna and Farsight seems close enough to grasp now. In order to show our allegiance to the NCR, as well as to quiet down the last doubters of his alliance with Gawdyna, Ranger-General Farsight has officially announced that the Old Appleloosa Rangers are no more, and all of us shall henceforth be known as the NCR Rangers!\nMany of the former slaves celebrated at that announcement, knowing they finally had a cause worth fighting, and maybe even worth dying for.\n\nBut while the lower ranks celebrated, Farsight and his general staff have already started planning their Great Expedition into the Desert, intent on bringing Civilization, and to spread the Banner of the NCR over the entire Southwest."
