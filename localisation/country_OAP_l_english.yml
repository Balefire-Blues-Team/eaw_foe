 oldappleloosa.1.title:0 "Red Eye's New Overseer"
 oldappleloosa.1.desc:0 "After the debacle that ended with the last \"Overseer\" Red Eye sent being crushed by a train car, he has sent another. This alicorn, who has requested that we refer to her has \"Consequtia\", has already proven to be a much more ruthless overseer than the last; A feat most thought to be impossible. She has already killed Steel Shackles for her failure to capture the ones responisble for her sister's death, and has now taken direct control over Old Appleloosa, putting us under Red Eye's direct control."
 oldappleloosa.1.a:0 "Well okay then."
 oldappleloosa.1.b:0 "We'd Rather Not"

 oldappleloosa.2.title:0 "Securing Old Appleloosa"
 oldappleloosa.2.desc:0 "We have received word from Consequtia, the alicorn we sent to oversee our interests in Old Appleloosa, that she has settled in nicely. In even better news, it seems that the former leader of the slavers there, Steel Shackles, will no longer be a hinderance to our vision. Already we have seen an increase in the number of slaves coming from Appleloosa, and with the nexus of the Equestrian slave trade now under our command, we can expect that to grow even more."
 oldappleloosa.2.a:0 "Well okay then."
