TEN.1.title:0 "The MAS hub"
TEN.1.desc:0 "Tenpony Tower. A luxury hotel, known for housing the Ministry of Arcane Science's Manehatten Hub. When Balefire began raining from the sky, those ponies working within the Hub were some of the first to know. Orders came in from Canterlot to fire the prototype megaspell Celestia One at Roam, capital of the Zebra empire. Knowing that Manehatten would be a primary target, the ponies of the Ministry had to make a choice. They could follow their orders and focus on casting the megaspell, or ignore their orders and focus on using the Manehatten Emergency Broadcasting System to warn the residents of the city. There wouldn't be enough time to do both, and the seconds were ticking down."
TEN.1.a:0 "Sound the Emergency Broadcast System"
TEN.1.b:0 "Fire Celestia One!"

TEN.2.title:0 "Walls of Balefire"
TEN.2.desc:0 "Tenpony Tower was able to survive the wrath of the Balefire bombs thanks to a series of thick steel walls that coat the MAS hub, unfortunately it was still heavily damaged with the outer walls ripped apart and not a single window survived the shockwave. Soon after irradiated air seeped into the tower. A group of volunteers had requested that they take their protective suits from their labs and go out to repair and fortify the outer walls. Another group had proposed that they’d leave the outer walls to be used as a trap for Ghouls and other abominations and instead focused on fortifying the still functional inner walls."
TEN.2.a:0 "Repair the outer wall"
TEN.2.b:0 "Fortify the inner walls"

TEN.3.title:0 "Outside Communication"
TEN.3.desc:0 "The years following the Balefire were harsh, even to the relatively lucky occupants of Tenpony Tower. The Tower was never stocked to be a long-term survival shelter, and the M.A.S.'s emergency provisions would only last so long. As a result, the ponies within rapidly found themselves running out of food and supplies alike. So, the moment the radiation levels outside were deemed "acceptable", a scavenging expedition was launched to obtain crucial supplies. However, the ponies of this expedition quickly found that they were not the only ones within the devastated ruins of Manehatten. They found a nearby settlement, built with scrap on top of old ruins. Upon getting closer to the settlement, they were shocked to find it full of the undead! The expedition backed away and considered their options. They could attempt to approach these things and see if they were willing to trade. Alternatively, they put an end to these abominations and take all they have. After all, what need do the dead have for food?"
TEN.3.a:0 "Try approaching the zombies."
TEN.3.b:0 "Make the dead stay dead."

TEN.4.title:0 "Ghoul Problem"
TEN.4.desc:0 "Life in our tower was very serene, safe and calm (for those who had the caps), but it seems that peace can come to an end. One of our major Wasteland product suppliers has provided us with valuable information regarding the ghoul population in Manehattan. Namely, about a large settlement of zombies near our tower. It's amazing how they have not attacked us yet, given the carelessness and the unreadiness of our guard to defend against massive enemy groups. Let it be just ghouls, but the problem of their unwanted neighborhood next to us needs a solution. To begin with, first of all, a worthy intelligence is required to be one hundred percent sure that this is reliable information, and at the same time, to find out how many ghouls can potentially attack us."
TEN.4.a:0 "Send out some of our Officers to investigate"

TEN.5.title:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
TEN.5.desc:0 "Grim Star sat in his office, pondering what he heard. A huge accumulation of ghouls by the standards of the wasteland. Let them be more or less reasonable, their leader was clearly close to becoming feral. The unicorn did not see a way out of the situation, except to conclude a contract with Blackwing's Talons, hoping that they would restrain the onslaught in the event of an attack. Or help deliver a preemptive strike. While smoking a smoldering cigarette, he turned his gaze out the window, looking at the ruins of skyscrapers, cracked paved highways and the rusted remains of the Celestia line. He decided to secretly hire a band of griffins, so as not to incur the wrath of his superiors, who are forever against widespread cooperation with the outside world. And who are against paying Talons to do the dirty work. Grim Star is not afraid of possible anger from the Twilight Society, or to spend a lot of his own caps. He sees the meaning of his existence only in that Tenpony stood forever, being the beacon of civilization in the Wasteland of Equestria, and saw the only way out of this situation only in mercenaries. And so, throwing away the cigarette butt as it burned his lips , he decided."
TEN.5.a:0 "Grim Star concludes a contract with Blackwing and her mercenaries"
TEN.5.b:0 "The Twilight Society stops Grim Star."

TEN.6.title:0 "The Star fell and crashed"
TEN.6.desc:0 "What was I hoping for? What would they praise me for, or would they pat me on the head with a hoof?" — Grim Star mentally scrolled in his head the events of the contract, thinking who could know about it. Everything went wrong at the last moment. As soon as he left the meeting place with Blackwing's talons, a security guard twisted it and reported the incident to the Twilight Society, in hopes of taking the place of Grim Star as Head of Security. The Society confined themselves not to expulse Grim Star from the Tower, but only to temporary arrest, and the deprivation of his post. However, Grim Star did not feel betrayed. He has done his duty as conscientiously as possible, concluding a contract with the Talons, which is very necessary for the weakened guard of the Tower. Now, he could sleep peacefully, knowing that his work was not wasted, let no one thank him."
TEN.6.a:0 "He will learn to consult the Society next time."

TEN.7.title:0 "Ghouls slaughtered"
TEN.7.desc:0 "Grim Star has hired Blackwing's talons to take out the Ghoul Sherrif Rottingtail who is slowly going mad. Blackwing's talons tried taking out Rottingtail quietly but it failed and the ghouls attack Blackwing's talons. Forcing them to take out all the ghouls. "
TEN.7.a:0 ""

TEN.8.title:0 "DJ Pon3's Broadcast"
TEN.8.desc:0 "\"Got your ears up, faithful listeners? Cuz I’ve been talkin’ and some of you ain’t been listenin’. For years now, I’ve been reminding you that ghouls and zombies ain’t the same thing. Ghouls are ponies who have had the misfortune of soaking up a major dose of magical radiation and not dying. That stuff twists and rots their bodies, but unlike zombies, their minds are still like those of any other pony, and they deserve t’ be treated as such.\"\n\n\"Well, some of you ponies up in Tenpony Tower didn’t get the message. And when Sheriff Rottingtail kept pressin’ for him and his ghouls t’ be allowed inside, just cuz they were sick of being hounded by manticores an’ slaughtered by bloodwings, Chief Grim Star, the head of Tenpony security, responded by hiring a bunch of mercenaries to scour the tenements along the Celestia Line and wipe them all out.""

TEN.9.title:0 "Returning Officers"
TEN.9.desc:0 "The security officers returned from their reconnaissance. Unfortunately they were discovered by the zombies and one died as he fought them valiantly head on, giving his fellow officers time to escape. A full report of the investigation has been delivered on Grim Star's desk."
TEN.9.a:0 "We will honour our fallen comrade when all of this is over."

TEN.10.title:0 "Opening of the Tenpony Library"
TEN.10.desc:0 "We are happy to announce the opening of the new Twilight Sparkle Library! The Library is both a place of learning for our residents and a monument to the Ministry Mare herself and her life's work.\n\nLocated at the far end of the commercial district, the Library will operate during standard daytime hours, Monday through Saturday. All residents are granted free entry and rentals, though outsiders are expected to pay a small fee for such.\n\nIt will also host books from Twilight Sparkle's own personal collection. Much of this rare literature has not been available to the public since before The War itself and has, until now, been lost to time.\n\nWe hope our valued residents will make use of and enjoy this new facility. Have a good day, and happy reading!\n\n- The Tenpony Tower Administration."
TEN.10.a:0 "Knowledge is finally being restored to the wasteland."

TEN.11.title:0 "Pre-war books found"
TEN.11.desc:0 "While walking around Twilight's Athenaeum, one of our ponies discovered a hidden section behind some bookshelves - upon further investigation, they have found many books telling about relationships between Ponies and Zebras along with many books with a "BANNED" or "CENSORED" typed out on them. Looks like Ministry of Image didn't want this to show up in the open..."
TEN.11.a:0 "We have found the forbidden knowledge."

TEN.12.title:0 "DJ Pon3's Broadcast"
TEN.12.desc:0 "In an interview, when asked how he had managed to be such a supreme douche bag, Chief Grim Star had this to say:\"\n\nAnother voice, gruff and irritated, came through the radio’s speakers. \"Fuck off. I did what was right by those I swore to protect.\"\n\nDJ Pon3’s voice returned. \"Just warms the heart to know that there are ponies steadfastly defending prejudice and bigotry, doesn’t it? Thank you, Chief Grim Star and may Celestia bless you with a kiss from the sun.\" The last certainly sounded like it was said through gritted teeth."

TEN.14.title:0 "A Change in Management"
TEN.14.desc:0 "Residents awoke this morning to discover that Tenpony Tower had undergone a change in management overnight. A number of security forces loyal to the former disgraced Chief Grim Star have taken full control of the Tower, stationing loyal guards at each security post and declaring martial law. All residents are expected to have a valid reason to move through any security checkpoints, and access to the Administrative District has been fully restricted.\n\nDue to the ongoing lockdown of the Administrative District, the Tenpony Armory has been repurposed to serve as a temporary administrative office for the Tower. All members of the previous Tenpony Administration are currently under house arrest, with their fates uncertain. Various security staff and trusted residents have been appointed to temporarily manage the Tower. \n\nAs for Grim Star himself, he was released from his cell in the early hours of the morning. Though he had very little to do with directing the apparent coup itself, he has now assumed full command of his forces and of the Tower. In an official statement, he had this to say:\n\n\"I wish to reassure every resident of Tenpony Tower that I, and all of Tenpony Security, have only their best interests at heart. Know we did not take this action lightly, but rather, we took it only to protect and further the interests of every one of you. We know that this change may be sudden, and many ponies have already expressed a great deal of concern regarding it. However, we are fully dedicated to ensuring that this transition is as smooth as possible, and we look forward to resuming normal life soon enough. Until then, just remember that we are your friends, not your enemies.\""
TEN.14.a:0 "Times Are Changing"

TEN.15.title:0 "You Gotta Shoot 'Em in the Head"
TEN.15.desc:0 "The ghouls thought themselves to be well defended, behind their scrap walls and salvaged barricades. And perhaps they would of stood a chance if they were just facing a disorganized gang of raiders, or a small band of slavers. However, much to their misfortune, they weren't facing either of those. Rather, they were facing the full might and force of Tenpony Security!\n\nOn Grim Star's orders, a small army of our finest guards set about wiping out the ghoul threat. Though their makeshift walls may of made our approach difficult, they proved to be the only real obstacle we faced. All it took was blowing them down with explosives, and then charging in. From there, it was like shooting mutated fish in an irradiated barrel. Most of the zombies didn't even have guns!\n\nDespite our success, it isn't all good news. That damned Sheriff Rotting Tail managed to take out several of our brave guards as they were attempting to breach the walls. A funeral service will be held for them, and plans are already being drafted for a monument to their sacrifice. At least Rotting Tail and his ilk will never bother us again."
TEN.15.a:0 "Another threat erradicated."

TEN.16.title:0 "Revolt!"
TEN.16.desc:0 "This is a message from the rightful Administration of Tenpony Tower, now broadcasting from the reclaimed Tenpony Information Center. We ask that those of you who are sensible and wish to see a return to sanity aid us in our cause, to restore peace and order to the Tower that we built up.\n\nOn this day, one year ago, the traitorous and maniacal Grim Star forcibly seized control of the Tower that this Administration worked so hard to make great. This terrible move is one that we could of forgiven, if it had been but a misguided act of protectiveness towards our valued residents. However, this was not the case. The traitor's actions then, and since then, have been those of a mad man, who cares only about his own power and little more. What he has down has ruined our great tower, destroyed the lives of our residents, and destroyed our reputation across the wasteland.\n\nThis must end.\n\nAs we speak, those loyal to the cause of serving our residents are moving to secure the Mall. Though the battle may be fierce, and though our losses may be many, we know that it is preferable to Grim Star's ongoing madness. A madness that goes against all this Tower has ever stood for! Even now, he barricades himself in his armory like a coward! We shall drag him out by his flank if we must, and force him to face trial for the crimes he has committed during his illegitimate rule!\n\nWe also are extending an offer to those of you among Grim Star's ranks who are still rational enough to recognize his madness. Any who throw down their arms and surrender will not be held accountable for anything they were forced to do under Grim Star's rule. Rather, they shall be welcomed back as full residents of our beloved Tower, just as soon as we resecure our rule.\n\nTo those resident's still trapped within Grim Star's clutches, we tell you this, hang in there. Help is on the way.\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely, the Tenpony Tower Administration."

A recent discovery just proved this once more.\n\nA few days ago, a maintenance group was clearing out one of the many hallways on the Western side of the building. Apparently, a corridor has been buried by countless boxes and other remnants of the former Equestria since the end of the war. After the debris had been removed, our team faced a smaller corridor with four rooms on both sides.\n\nThere is a terminal at the entrance, that used to list all the items inside of them. Most of the data became corrupted by now, however, we managed to restore some of it.\n\nWhile it's not impossible to hack the interlock of the doors, it's time-consuming and our technicians are already needed on other locations, so we can only open one door at once."

TEN.29.title:0 "The Secure Door"
TEN.29.desc:0 "Deep within Tenpony Tower, hidden behind several fake walls and magical illusions, resided a door. On the surface, it looked to be a very simple door, one made of wood with a cheap plastic handle. However, as the Twilight Society knew all too well, looks can be deceiving. \n \n What initially appeared to be a rather mundane door was in fact one of the most secure entryways within the entire tower. Physically, the wood was merely a facade for hard metal that made up the actual door. The handle did nothing, with the real unlocking mechanism being entirely arcane in nature. More wards were placed on it than the tower itself, protecting both the door and the room it guarded. The best minds of the Twilight Society spent weeks analyzing each and every spell placed upon this entryway, trying to discern any possible method of unlocking it. A breakthrough was had, and it was determined that it would accept only a vocal phrase from a select individual. And so, one of the younger members of the Society was tasked with playing holotape recordings of various high ranking M.A.S officials, including the Ministry Mare herself. After a week straight, the correct phrase was found."

TEN.30.title:0 "An Unusual Find"
TEN.30.desc:0 "A great rumble shook Tenpony Tower, as a mighty door at its very heart opened. Numerous security wards were dispelled, automated turrets were put offline, and a young inductee would be the first to witness what appeared to be an impossibly huge library. More senior members of the Twilight Society were quick to respond, and a formal expedition into this well-guarded room was hastily organized. \n \n Within a hour, every senior member of the Society was brought together. As one, they made their way into this great library that had been kept secure for so long. Every book was contained within plain binding, with no titles or other markings denoting their contents. The first theory to be thrown out was that these were copies of banned literature. Another theory was that these all contained knowledge better left forgotten, dark magic and horrible hexes that were too evil for the public to have access to. They all tensed as a less cautious member of their group pulled a tome off of one of the many shelves along the wall, opened its cover, and began to read. \n \n 'A Rainbow Romance, by Twilight Sparkle.' \n \n Upon further examination, every single one of the thousands of books contained within the room seemed to be along similar lines. A simple vote was held, and it was decided to reseal the room and forget it had ever existed."
