  applejack.1.title:0 "Our New Oaths"
  applejack.1.desc:0 "For over two centuries, we have followed a path of preserving relics of the old world. Though our cause began as an effort to uphold our oaths, to see to it that the world could someday be rebuilt, the nobility of our goal was eroded through time. Good intentions gave way to selfishness, as preserving technology turned into hoarding it. The distance we had fallen wasn't made apparent until the uncaring brutality and insanity of Elder Cottage Cheese led our Contingent down a dark path, one that would only end in desolation and the betrayal of all those values we once held dear.\n\nNow, we are little more than a rogue Contingent, with our only unifying aspect being our shared desire to steer the Steel Rangers down a better path. There is a great deal of uncertainty as to what this path will be, with many different ideas being thrown around regarding where our loyalties should lie. The obvious choice is to uphold the vision of our founder, Applejack. We would seek to become the protectors of the downtrodden, the guardians of Equestria tasked with defending her ideals to the last. Alternatively, we can cut out the middlemare altogether and swear our allegiance to the ponies themselves. After all, are they not the ones who Applejack seeked to serve and protect?\n\nA less popular but still occasionally proposed idea, inspired by ideals that are common within the Fillydelphian Contingent, is to instead serve the Princesses once more. To commit ourselves to upholding the ideals of the Diarchy that still holds legitimate claim to our land, even if they are not with us in physical form anymore.\n\nUltimately, the choice is [Root.GetLeader]'s. Who do we swear our oaths to?"

  applejack.2.title:0 "The Trek from Stable 2"
  applejack.2.desc:0 "As we marched across the Wasteland on our return to Manehatten from Stable 2, we were met with many unexpected adventures and surprises. From our run in with an army of robots led by a sentient calculator to our meeting with a civilized hellhound, we experienced all sorts of excitement.\n\n As our journey progressed though, we found ourselves within increasingly hostile land. Raiders, slavers, and worst of all, Talons were constantly pestering our forces. We were forced to make a detour to avoid these threats, safely bypassing them and continuing towards Manehatten. During this detour, we found..."

  applejack.2.b:0 "A tribe that worshipped our founder, eager to join our ranks."

  applejack.3.title:0 "Early Clashes"
  applejack.3.desc:0 "When we returned home, we weren't met with open hooves by our brothers and sisters still loyal to their old ideals. Though bloodshed has remained limited thus far between our two forces, there is little but open hostility towards us by those we once considered to be our family. They spit upon us, calling us traitors and kinslayers. Ironic accusations, coming from those who betrayed our founder's ideals and sought to slaughter her descendants.\n\nOccasional skirmishes have been breaking out between our forces and theirs, small-scale fights that serve as nothing more than ways to vent our mutual aggression. However, it is likely only a matter of time before these incidents escalate into all out warfare against our former Contingent. We must decide on a course of action as clouds gather on the horizon, before the storm itself comes upon us."
  applejack.3.a:0 "Learn from these fights."
  applejack.3.b:0 "Prepare our defenses."
  applejack.3.c:0 "Strike them first!"

  applejack.4.title:0 "Backup from Trottingham"
  applejack.4.desc:0 "Panic overtook our forces guarding the shoreline today, as a large unidentified vessel approached our land. Even more concerning than the vessel itself was the noise coming from it, a truly earth shattering bass-boosted rendition of an old patriotic tune composed during the Great War. Alarm quickly overtook our Rangers, as the ship even went so far as to fire off it's canons in tune to the music.\n\nWhen the ship docked, they were met with a dozen Paladins ready and equipped to deal with an army of hostile invaders. To our great relief, the ponies who stepped off of the ship weren't bloodthirsty raiders here to pillage our Contingent, but were instead clad in the armor of the Trottingham Contingent. Led by Paladin Crumb Pudding, they announced that they were here to render aid to their fellow Rangers in need.\n\nAfter everypony calmed down and our Paladins put their grenade machine guns away, the volunteers from Trottingham were given a proper welcome and escorted to our base of operations to meet with [Root.GetLeader]."
  applejack.4.a:0 "Welcome, friends!"

  applejack.5.title:0 "To Teach an Old Dog New Tricks"
  applejack.5.desc:0 "As he followed Littlepip on her journey across the Wasteland, Steelhooves learned many new things and remembered many more forgotten lessons. In the Lightbringer's example, he saw those ideals which had once been prevalent within the Old World. In her constant self-destructive effort to help the Wasteland, she sacrificed bit after bit of herself for the good of all. Such was one of her greatest virtues, even if she had trouble seeing it that way.\n\nOf course, she never could have accomplished anything without her friends. Friends who Steelhooves gladly counted himself among. In companionship and friendship, she surpassed her limits and pushed ever onwards long after the point where most would have given up. For friendship holds a magic of its own, one that once made Equestria a shining beacon of prosperity and harmony.\n\nOut of these two lessons, both invaluable in their own right, one of them stood out more than the other.

Three proposals have been provided, with each gathering a sizable amount of support among our Rangers.\n\nFirstly, the obvious choice of staying in Stable 29. It serves as an iconic site, being home to our cause for so long. The ease of defending it and the many Stable-Tec amenities that it provides have also gone a long way towards making it a popular choice.\n\nThen there is our old Contingents home within Bucklyn Cross. Though the bunker has suffered heavy damage as a result of our war, it could still serve as a viable base of operations with a few repairs. This proposal has seen quite a bit of popularity among those Rangers who remain sympathetic to their brothers and sisters who we were forced to fight against. They claim that it would go a long way towards both unifying the Rangers and cementing us as the legitimate successors to the old Contingent.\n\nFinally, a less popular proposal has been made to move our operations to Orangedale. It is far more accessible than the other two locations and would be an ideal area to begin integrating our civilian population. Of course, it is also far less defended and would likely require a bit of expansion before it could serve as a proper headquarters."

One of the biggest pieces on the board is the New Canterlot Republic, a nation to the south that models itself after old Equestrian politics and bureaucracy. They managed to enter the playing stage far quicker than most other nations, with the power and wealth to fuel their overall ambitions. Through their own expansion they managed to create an adaptable government capable of handling any amount of issues tossed at them, and it has only seemed to make the nation stronger. It now looks after its many states as well as its own grand and respectable army. However, their ideals seem to fluctuate just as much as their expanding borders, and their recent expansionism is only kept in check by the competency in their greedy administration.\n\nWe could try asking for an alliance with the NCR, or just simply not bother them, but our clash with the powerhouse seems only inevitable."

Their current senator, Seafire, seems to be quite the diplomatic type, and has apparently been changing their traditionalist policies to better suit the land they now inhabit under the clouds.

He claims to lead the group, and says they represent the recently formed Applejack's Rangers north in Manehattan. After an introduction, we greeted the envoys and let them inside, allowing them to explain their mission. After an explanation on how they have recently emerged victorious from a brutal war against their opposing contingent, their paladin emphasized their own change in ideals, and how they are not the selfish Steel Rangers one would normally expect, but instead new soldiers with a new mission. After some exposition and a moment to collect our thoughts, they went on to ask us for an alliance and an opportunity for friendship between our nations."

If this is true, it would align with our records of the area where they are seemingly the surviving faction that managed to emerge victorious from a brutal civil war.

Despite the countless years we can plan to spend on repairing ourselves, our recovery so far has been steady enough to finally let us look outwards as well as inwards. The innumerable number of wounded rangers from the war now serve within our ranks once more, all of them carrying a vigorous spark that shows their dedication to the new cause.\n\nWe will continue to work hard at keeping our land safe, while also enduring and rebuilding after the devastation caused by the Manehattan contingent. We've lost many good rangers along the way, but we're stronger because of it.\n\nAs we settle back into a proper routine, we can finally start working towards our original mission: to make sure that no pony ever has to suffer under the rule of evil, to protect the legacy and purity of Equestria, and most importantly, to make sure Applejack's ideals lives on within all of us and the entirety of the Wasteland."

The remnants of the Manehatten Raiders have persisted since before our Contingent was even brought about, raiding caravans and extorting tribute from travelers under the uncaring reign of Elder Cottage Cheese. During the War of Oaths, this was allowed to continue simply by necessity, as we lacked the resources and ponypower needed to deal with the raider menace.\n\nNow that the War is over, we finally find ourselves in a position to restore law and order across our land. Our patrols have been ordered to shoot any raiders on sight and our Paladins have begun to conduct organized raids against the various raider strongholds across the city. The roads have already grown far safer, as the scum that thrived while we were unable to deal with them have begun to retreat further away from our outposts.\n\nTo make our stance on all raiders and their ilk clear, we have also ordered that an example be made of their largest stronghold. The town of Blood-Orangedale, a hub for raider activity and other criminal pursuits, has been forcibly purged of those fiends who had priorly called it home. Their blood has joined that of their slaves and victims, painting the streets a brighter shade of red. Our bravest Paladins led the assault, firing upon every raider they saw and sparing none. The destruction of their den of scum and villainy was accompanied with the demise of many of the most influential gang leaders within the region, further aiding our efforts to restore order. Before long, we look forward to driving the raider menace out of the city entirely."

Indeed, some of those captured have professed a great regret towards the War ever occurring to begin with and claim to have desired a peaceful solution to it. However, there also exist many Rangers who took satisfaction in massacring our own, believing themselves to have been fully justified in dealing with those they viewed as traitors.\n\nIndeed, many of the Paladins who we have captured show little to no remorse at all when speaking of the War. They see themselves and their actions as being in the right, with us being firmly cemented as kinslayers in their eyes. Even within their cells, some of them continue to berate us and refuse any mercy we extend towards them.\n\nThe most popular choice to deal with our prisoners is to show grace and pardon those who never wished us harm to begin with. Those guilty of atrocities though, along with those who aren't in the slightest repentant even now, would be exiled from our city forever. We could also show that we are better than them by offering a pardon to all of them, though this would be a far less popular move. The idea has also been proposed by our more hardline elements to treat each and every one of them as an enemy combatant and punish them all harshly."

Though we would not go so far as to extend the full traditional protections and honors given to an Elder of another Contingent to them, there are many who still express doubt about treating them unfairly. As a result, the proposal of holding proper trials for them has garnered limited support.\n\nOf course, we already know what the result would be for most of them. They ordered countless atrocities, with some of them even directly participating in committing them. Their stances are firmly and fully opposed to our own cause and they hold little regard for the ideals of our founder. With all that in mind, we could save ourselves the time and trouble by just skipping right to our judgement, whatever that may be. It is unlikely that many will object."

Our ponies began moving towards our planned evacuation routes and our scouts were sent ahead to ensure that they could reach a relatively safe area across the city, when the Steel Rangers did something unexpected. They talked to us.\n\nTheir 'ambassador', a pony who identified themselves as 'Paladin Daffodil', explained to us that they were here to offer us safety and support. They talked for some time about helping us rebuild our part of the city, develop our economy, and of course to bolster our defences against any who would seek us harm.\n\nNeedless to say, our bats remain skeptical of the legitimacy of their offer.

Brother killed brother, sister killed sister, and blood ran through the streets of Manehatten. It was a brutal affair, one that most within our Contingent had never expected to see within their lifetimes. How could we have fallen so low?\n\nFortunately, we have emerged from that horrid time intact and have been made all the stronger for it.

This ended poorly, with it actively killing off the residents in order to maximize the survivability of the others. Though we have taken care to disconnect it from all of the Stable's systems, this has gone a long way towards cementing distrust towards the machine. On top of that, it was also the final obsession of the late Elder Cottage Cheese. He believed he could transfer himself into it, ascending to become one with the machine. Of course, he was stopped thanks to the Lightbringer, and his nefarious plot would never come to fruition.\n\nSo now the question has been raised as to how to handle the impressive machine. While it will never again serve its intended purpose, we could put it to work running calculations and helping our research efforts. It would be a great boon to our scribes.

Applejack once set her determination to not only protect what she loved most, but to make the world a better place.

And now, with the help of all those who have fought to get us where we are today, we will continue to work towards the same goal.\n\nWe are the Applejack Rangers. Not only is our mission to protect the innocent, but we must now strive to safeguard the original Elements. The Wasteland may be ever changing, but there will always be potential bearers for the Elements of Harmony. The trouble will be finding them under the endless turmoil that plagues the wastes. This is why we must commence a campaign to set out expeditions and find the true bearers of the Elements of Harmony. Finding and protecting these bearers won’t be an easy task, but it’s still a task we must accomplish regardless.

Opening the message, she was met with text followed by an attachment file. Ignoring the attachment for now, she eagerly scanned her brother's words.\n\n'Hey sis. I'm on a public term rn. Don't have a lot of time, the old caravanner wants to leave soon. He was selling a holocamera, which I knew you'd just love. See the picture I attached for it.'\n\n'Travels have gone well. Thanks to the patrols, raiders aren't around anymore and the city's more peaceful than I've ever seen before. Crazy, isn't it? It's odd not having to worry about the rest of you back at home. Not bad though.'\n\n'Anyways, the old grump's glaring at me now. I'm afraid I won't be able to get your return message, but I'll message you again when I get the chance. Catch ya later sis.'\n\nTurning her attention to his attachment, New Blossom clicked on it and watched it slowly load in blocks. This 'giddy-up' system was amazing! Her features lit up even brighter as she saw a picture of her brother smiling at a camera, his familiar features being on blurry display for her to see."

  applejack.44.desc:0 "Gruffmane snorted at the terminal sitting before him. These machines had been heralded as the dawn of a new era, a great leap forward into a golden age for ponykind. He didn't see what all the fuss was about. From what he could see, they were nothing but a passing fad. They would never replace the good honest courier, the only true reliable method of delivering letters. Besides, they couldn't even be used to deliver packages! What use was that?\n\nDespite his reservations, he had promised his granddaughter that he'd give it a try. Slowly inching his hoof-pointer to an icon of an apple overlaid over a map of Equestria, he opened up the 'web browser'. The screen that greeted him, once it finally loaded (he nearly fell asleep waiting on it) was a news feed. News? On a terminal? Now this was intriguing.\n\nLooking through it, he found all sorts of reports from all over Equestria. From the day-to-day lives of ponies in Manehatten to the struggles of ponies within the Appleloosan Deserts, there was all sorts of news here! And even more, he could see other ponies talking about them and discussing everything that was happening in the world today! It was nothing short of astonishing to the old stallion.\n\nHis amazement only grew as he found another link claiming to be for today's weather. Going to it, he was met with the expected weather forecast for the remainder of the week, assuming no drastic shifts by the pegasi. Staring at the device before him in new-found awe, he couldn't help but to be immensely impressed. It could even predict the weather! Is there anything this terminal couldn't do?"

  applejack.45.title:0 "The Ministry Mare and her Ranger"
  applejack.45.desc:0 "As Steelhooves' remains were moved through the orchard of Stable 2, the ceremony surrounding it was no-less respectful than it was the day of his funeral. Indeed, the reverence for their fallen Elder had only grown over time. Even those Rangers here who hadn't fought alongside him, who hadn't even known of him, were still paying him the respect he was due.\n\nElder Crossroads did little more than gaze at her former leader, as his remains were placed into the grave that she led a team of volunteers in digging. It was the least she could've done. She had spoken before about him, at length, and now there was little left to be said. Despite that, she couldn't just remain silent as such a respected hero was laid to his final rest. Turning her attention to the gathered crowd, she spoke.\n\n'Many of you remember the stallion before you. Some of you do not. Regardless, we are all here today to see him off to his final slumber. One where he shall no longer be alone, but instead joined by our very founder and the love of his life. For here, in this Stable where our Mission was given form, in this very Orchard that we stand upon, is the body of Applejack. Ministry Mare of the Ministry of Wartime Technology. And now, next to her, lies the most faithful of her soldiers. The one who died to uphold her ideals. May he guard her in the next life, as he guarded her in this one.'\n\nShe quickly averted her eyes from the gathered Rangers, not wanting them to see their Elder lose her composure. The assembled Rangers bowed their heads in respect, as the final resting place of Steelhooves was filled in with soil."

  applejack.46.title:0 "The Sweetest Apple"
  applejack.46.desc:0 "Being able to bask in the comfort of these orchards will never grow old to me, each shining apple was grown no thanks to the Apple legacy. The sense of comfort it can give to any pony is unrivaled. Even if the soil on the surface has proven too cruel to accept the Apple orchards, it still lives on here. And yet, being here only brings me closer to the mare I loved most... Applejack.\n\nI never took you for just your qualities, you were so much more than that. It was the way you carried life with such dignity and strength; how you always made sure everyone else felt ease around you, no matter how tense the situation. You could make even the weakest ponies smile at the sight of danger, as long as they stood alongside you. Ponies admired your integrity, your candor, your... honesty. But it wasn't just your honesty. The mare I fell in love with learned to overcome the fear of showing your flaws to others by placing your trust in them. You struck down any obstacle, not by just being brave or honest, but with the companionship of others. You taught me that true foolishness comes not from being strong enough to overcome a challenge, but from not having the courage to be honest to your friends. That's what I admired about you so much. Most importantly, you taught me that there is no journey worth taking without being able to spend it with the ones that make life worth living. It's these lessons that taught me to learn to follow others, as without your advice, I would've never been able to follow Littlepip or be able to lead your rangers. They may see me as the unwavering, enduring stallion that charges no matter the danger, but in truth, there is one fear I cannot ever hope to overcome.\n\nForgetting you.\n\nYour eyes, your laugh, your smile... all those things which made you wonderful. Even if I run the risk of more of your memory fading each and every day, I remind myself that wallowing in the fear of forgetting your memories won't help. As I grow older in this Wasteland, each day brings me new memories of my friends and fellow Rangers. As slow as I was to trust them, you would be the one to tell me to place my life in their hooves, just as they would for me.\n\nNo matter what lies ahead of me in this life of mine, I will carry on your name for as long as I can. You may no longer be physically with me, but your thoughts are, and I know we'll be able to reunite someday. Until then, I will do everything I can..."

  AJR_applejack21_d_steelhooves:0 "Despite the frantic attempts to persuade him otherwise, the Elder of Applejack's Rangers found himself trotting through the derelict hallways of Bucklyn Cross. He had to see it for himself, see what this war had cost. He already knew the numbers, of course. At least what could be tallied on his side of the conflict. However, many within the Manehatten Contingent remained unaccounted for. Some fled, of course, but many more were simply rotting away from within their armor.\n\nTaking a detour to avoid a partially collapsed hallway, Steelhooves stopped as he came across a suit of power armor lying on the floor. He knew that inside would be a corpse, preserved by the airtight seals that protected the pony it once was from the outside world. This wasn't even the first abandoned body the Elder had come across that day, for many more still littered the upper halls of the bunker. Removing them was an affair in and of itself, leading to the process of collecting them and disposing of them being very slow going.\n\nBreaking his gaze, Steelhooves resumed his march deeper into the depths of the base. He still had to see how the lowest levels had fared, where a desperate last stand was made against the perceived invaders. None of this should have happened. Yet it did, and the corpses littering the hallways would never be brought back to life. All he could do now was carry on and try to make the world better for everypony, so that atrocities like these would never be necessary again."
  AJR_applejack21_a_steelhooves:0 "War is hell."

  AJR_applejack21_t_crossroads:0 "What Remains"
  AJR_applejack21_d_crossroads:0 "Trotting down the devastated halls of Bucklyn Cross, Elder Crossroads hardly liked what she was seeing. The damage that the bunker had suffered was substantial, only growing worse the further down she went. Entire sections collapsed, some from excessive fire and others from an intentional effort to try to delay the invading force. Every other hallway was strewn with a mix of corpses and rubble, another site of a battle between two heavily armed forces.\n\nComing to a power armored corpse, the Elder snorted in disdain. Why couldn't they all surrender peacefully, like the majority of the Scribes did? It would have saved quite a bit of bloodshed, not to mention explosives and ammunition. Turning to one of the Paladins following her, Crossroads gave the order for the corpse to be moved to the upper levels. There, many of the Knights and Scribes were working around the clock to reclaim the armor and dump the corpses into the river below. It wasn't pretty work, but it was necessary.\n\nComing to what once served as the Councilroom for those Paladins who appointed themselves as the Manehatten Contingent's authority, Crossroads felt a very different emotion towards the condition of this area. Utter anger and hatred. While the hallways outside were blasted ruins, the sites of brutal fighting between two equally determined armies, the room that they had all died defending was pristine by comparison. The Council had simply allowed the Rangers under their command to die for them while they did nothing but hide. It was nothing short of disgusting to the mare, who would sooner give her life fighting alongside those under her command than hide away in some hole in the ground. At the end of the day, the Manehatten Rangers were foalish for putting their trust and faith in such cowards. As such, they deserved their fate."
