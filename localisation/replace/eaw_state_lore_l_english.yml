state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_21:0 "Tenpony Tower"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_21:0 "The §tMAS Hub§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_21:0 "Before that fateful day -  the day when megaspells rained from the sky, and great swaths of balefire ravaged the world - §YTenpony Tower§! stood tall, a beacon of knowledge and hope for all who sought it. Before that fateful day, when the sounds of hundreds of hooves rushing to the Celestia Line monorail echoed through its ornate marble halls one last time, filled with the preserves and accomplishments of the §tMinistry of Arcane Sciences§!... Tenpony Tower stood strong.\n\nBut that matters not, at least not anymore. Now is the age of rebuilding - An age of menial labor, an age of entrepreneurship - a chance to do it all again. What knowledge that remains within the §Cvast libraries§! of the tower will help in that regard. In order to prove one's worth to the tower and its newfound purpose, they must show a consistent effort in maintaining the stability and well being of Tenpony as a whole. Failing to meet the quota will prevent one from obtaining citizenship.\n\nThis is not the only threat to the tower, though. Raiders, Ghouls, and even the Steel Rangers are always stalking the nearby wastes, looking for an opportunity to strike when the time is right. Nonetheless, the tower will stand. It MUST stand, no matter the consequences."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_515:0 "The Light"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_515:0 "The §YCity§! of §YLight§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_515:0 "Before the war, Light was nothing more than a §Ypower plant§! tucked away in the hills east of Fillydelphia, providing electricity to the City of Sisterly Love. As those not killed outright from the Balefire Bombs or the subsequent fallout fled the city, many came to settle around the still functional plant, laying the foundation for what would become Light. Over the 200 years since then, Light has blossomed into a proper city of it's own, using the ancient generator systems to power the thousands of twinkling lights that give it it's name, casting a great glow across the hills when night falls.\n\nLight truly came into it's own under the decades long tenure of §CMayor Pokey Posey§!, who solidified Light's control over the surrounding countryside via less than savory tactics. Mayor Posey voluntarily left office at the ripe age of 97, and ushered in the current democratic system that Light uses today. In the years preceding §RRed Eye's§! brutal conquest of Fillydelphia, Light grew rich off of trade with the ponies living in the ruins of the city, including the local Steel Ranger contingent. Despite it's previous prosperity, its potential has been squandered by a string of ineffective, incompetent, or downright corrupt mayors."
