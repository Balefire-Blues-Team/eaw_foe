state_lore_text_container_state_description_21:0 "Before that fateful day -  the day when megaspells rained from the sky, and great swaths of balefire ravaged the world - §YTenpony Tower§! stood tall, a beacon of knowledge and hope for all who sought it. Before that fateful day, when the sounds of hundreds of hooves rushing to the Celestia Line monorail echoed through its ornate marble halls one last time, filled with the preserves and accomplishments of the §tMinistry of Arcane Sciences§!... Tenpony Tower stood strong.\n\nBut that matters not, at least not anymore. Now is the age of rebuilding - An age of menial labor, an age of entrepreneurship - a chance to do it all again. What knowledge that remains within the §Cvast libraries§! of the tower will help in that regard. In order to prove one's worth to the tower and its newfound purpose, they must show a consistent effort in maintaining the stability and well being of Tenpony as a whole. Failing to meet the quota will prevent one from obtaining citizenship.\n\nThis is not the only threat to the tower, though. Raiders, Ghouls, and even the Steel Rangers are always stalking the nearby wastes, looking for an opportunity to strike when the time is right. Nonetheless, the tower will stand. It MUST stand, no matter the consequences."
