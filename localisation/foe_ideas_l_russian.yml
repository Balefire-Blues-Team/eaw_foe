 manticore_problems_desc:0 "Gutterville is plagued by frequent manticore attacks. The people are terrified to leave their homes and work. Where are these beasts coming from?!"

 hostile_spritebots:0 "Hostile Spritebots"
 hostile_spritebots_desc:0 "The Ministry of Morale Hub north of Gutterville is filled with valuable salvage and would be a great boon to our economy, if it wasn't infested with hostile spritebots. Sometimes those winged devils wander out of the Hub and right into where we are working!"

 enclave_conscription:0 "Enclave Conscription"
 enclave_conscription_desc:0 "Given the fact that very few civilian personnel are employed in Enclave ground-bases, most ponies present are active duty soldiers. Enclave civilians live above the clouds and never see the surface.\n"

 enclave_economy:0 "Cloud-Economy"
 enclave_economy_desc:0 "The economy of the Enclave is located almost entirely above the clouds, shielded from the Wasteland. Enclave cities only trade with eachother, ignoring the Wasteland for their own safety. The scarcity of resources above the clouds has made them experts in efficient extraction and recycling.\n"

 HSC_cult_myriad:0 "Cult of Myriad"
 HSC_cult_myriad_desc:0 "And the prophet heard the world speak: "Spread my children, spread far and wide, so that you may reclaim this land, that your ancestors so foolishly destroyed." And the Prophet knew it was true, and thus it was made law."

 NCG_three_guilds:0 "The Three Guilds"
 NCG_three_guilds_desc:0 "For as long as ponies have lived in Neocastle, under the clouded skies, the three Guilds have guided them. The Builders Guild contructs their homes and roads, the Miners Guild reclaims what resources are left of the old world, and the Mechanicum Guild produces what tools and utensils the ponies need."

 NCG_four_guilds:0 "The Four Guilds"
 NCG_four_guilds_desc:0 "Many belived Stern's invasion to be the end of the Guilds, but suprisingly, she kept them mostly intact, with one addition. The Slaver Guild now manages Neocastle's burgeoning slave trade and all the slaves in the city, aiding the projects of the other three guilds."

 ROK_the_moving_stones:0 "The Moving Boulders"
 ROK_the_moving_stones_desc:0 "A peculiar thing happens in these lands when no-one is watching: The rocks move by themselves! Nopony has ever seen them do it, but if you take your eyes of them for too long, they change position. Sometimes they also multiply, which has enabled a strange form of geoculture: Rock-farming. Sadly, these moving rocks regularly destroy roads and railways."

 REP_traditionalism:0 "Traditionalist Society"
 REP_traditionalism_desc:0 "The ponies of The Republic pride themselves for upholding a "Morally Righteous" society. Drugs, prostitution, and homosexuality are outlawed, and the public peace is guarded jealously."
 
 FTP_childish_society:0 "Foal Society"
 FTP_childish_society_desc:0 "As a nation mostly inhabited by foals, there isn't much government in place to coordinate things. Foals are also not strong enough to compete with adults in many things, and of course they don't tend to have children."
 
 FTA_talon_mercs:0 "Talon Mercenaries"
 FTA_talon_mercs_desc: "This country is ruled by Talon Mercenaries. While they are elite and great when it comes to warfare, they are griffons in pony land, and have trouble holding onto territory."

 OAP_centre_of_slave_trade_desc:0 "Old Appleloosa has long been the centre of the slave-trade in Equestria. Slaves from the southwest are brought here, loaded onto trains, and shipped further eastwards."
 
 RAR_we_ride_at_dawn:0 "Love of the Road"

 PBN_duststorms:0 "Frequent Duststorms"
 PBN_duststorms_desc:0 "The Plains are often ravaged by Duststorms, some lasting for days at a time. Construction and large projects are difficult in such an enviroment, but the locals know their way around, and any invading army will have one hell of a time during Storm-season."
 
 PBN_splinter_gangs:0 "Splinter-Gangs"
 PBN_splinter_gangs_desc:0 "When we conquered this region, we were mighty and unified, but not long after our success, we splintered apart. Many smaller Gangs and Warlords rule over outlying settlements and only pay lip-service to our mighty government. Recruitment is difficult in such an enviroment, but our troops are well trained in rooting out such persistant resistance."
 
 HSC_divided_tribe:0 "Division in the Swamps"
 HSC_divided_tribe_desc:0 "The Hayseed-Tribe has recently been split when the Cult of Myriad decided to defy the tribal elders and seceded. Many skirmishes have already taken place, but both sides know that all-out War is almost inevitable, and are preparing accordingly."
  
 MWY_wasteland_feudalism:0 "Wasteland Feudalism"
 MWY_wasteland_feudalism_desc:0 "Inspired by the ancient fables of gallant knights and the lords they served, the Equestrian Nobles who survived in Mareway when the bombs fell built up a structured society in the vain of the old feudal realms. Sitting at the top in the great wasteland city of New Mareway the Noble class rules over their holdings, which are protected (and often managed) by the Knights; soldiers of a new age, with guns instead of swords. On the Noble's land holding lives and works the majority of New Mareway's population: the Serfs, ponies who are little more than slaves with a fancy title..."

 SSC_fractured_coalition:0 "Fractured Coalition"
 SSC_fractured_coalition_desc:0 "The Sunnyshore Coalition is comprised of former enemies united against a greater threat, and as expected, doesn't function as a truely united fighting force. The Jasmine Raiders fight alone in the west, while the city of Hoofsburg only defends it's own intrests, with very little cooperation occurring between the coalition members."
 
 LRA_legacy_of_serfdom:0 "Legacy of Serfdom"
 LRA_legacy_of_serfdom_desc:0 "The Leslie Raiders were originally founded by a band of escaped serfs from Neocastle. Even now, Leslie facilitates something of an underground railroad to help determined serfs escape. Of course, those who slaved away their lives in the factories are unwilling to do so now that they are free... Although they are more than happy to defend their new freedom."
 
 LRA_old_blood_new_ideas:0 "Old Blood, New Ideas"
 LRA_old_blood_new_ideas_desc:0 "While we may have been founded by escaped serfs, over the years many miscreants and criminals from the region have made their home within our territory. Now, there is a conflict within our ranks betwwen the 'Old Blood', dedicated to freeing all the serfs of Neocastle and Mareway, and the 'Reformers' who seek to expand our raiding ways. They call on us to expand our reach and take down all who dare stand against us."
