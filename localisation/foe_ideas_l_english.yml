 hostile_spritebots:0 "Hostile Spritebots"
 hostile_spritebots_desc:0 "The Ministry Of Morale Hub to the north of Gutterville is filled with valuble salvage and would be a great boon to our economy, if it wasn't infested with hostile spritebots. Sometimes those winged devils wander out of the Hub and right into where we are working!"

 enclave_conscription:0 "Enclave Conscription"
 enclave_conscription_desc:0 "Given the fact that very few civilian personnel are employed in Enclave ground-bases, most ponies present are active duty soldiers. Enclave civilians mostly live above the clouds and never see the Surface."

 enclave_economy:0 "Cloud-Economy"
 enclave_economy_desc:0 "The economy of the Enclave is located almost entirely above the clouds, shielded from the Wasteland. Enclave cities only trade with eachother, ignoring the Wasteland for their own safety. The scarcity of resources above the clouds has made them experts in efficient extraction and recycling."

 HSC_cult_myriad:0 "Cult of Myriad"
 HSC_cult_myriad_desc:0 "And the Prophet heard the world speak "Spead my children, spread far and wide, so that you may reclaim this land, that your ancestors so foolishly destroyed." And the Prophet knew it was true, and thus it was made law."

 NCG_three_guilds:0 "The Three Guilds"
 NCG_three_guilds_desc:0 "For as long as ponies have lived in Neocastle, under the clouded skies, The Three Guilds have guided them. The Builders Guild contructs their homes and roads, the Miners Guild reclaims what resources are left of the old world, and the Mechanicum Guild produces what tools and utensils the ponies need."

 ROK_the_moving_stones:0 "The Moving Boulders"
 ROK_the_moving_stones_desc:0 "A peculiar thing happens in these lands when no-one is watching: The rocks move by themselves! Nopony has ever seen them do it, but if you take your eyes off them for too long, they change positions. Sometimes they also multiply, which has enabled a strange form of geoculture: rock-farming. Sadly, these moving rocks regularly destroy roads and railways."

 REP_traditionalism:0 "Traditionalist Society"
 REP_traditionalism_desc:0 "The ponies of The Republic pride themselves for upholding a "morally righteous" society. Drugs, prostitution and homosexuality are outlawed, and the public peace is guarded jealously."
 
 FTP_childish_society:0 "Foal Society"
 FTP_childish_society_desc:0 "As a nation mostly inhabited by foals, there isn't much government in place to coordinate things. Foals are also not strong enough to compete with adults in many things, and they have a tendency to not have any children of their own."
 
 FTA_talon_mercs:0 "Talon Mercenaries"
 FTA_talon_mercs_desc: "This country is ruled by Talon Mercenaries. While they are some of the most elite when it comes to warfare, they are griffons on pony land, and have trouble holding onto territory."
 
 OAP_centre_of_slave_trade:0 "Centre of the Slave-Trade"
 OAP_centre_of_slave_trade_desc:0 "Old Appleloosa has long been the centre of the Slave-trade in Equestria. Slaves from the southwest are brought here, loaded onto trains, and shipped further eastwards."
 
 RAR_we_ride_at_dawn:0 "Love of the Road"
 RAR_we_ride_at_dawn_desc:0 "These ponies live freely on the road, constantly skirmishing with eachother and honing their driving skills. Nopony has a greater understanding of the intricacies of motorized warfare than they do."
