 ROK_the_moving_stones_desc:0 "A peculiar thing happens in these lands when no-one is watching: The Rocks move by themselves! Nopony has ever seen them do it, but if you take your eyes of them for too long, they change position. Sometimes they also multiply, which has enabled a strange form of geoculture: Rock-farming. Sadly, these moving rocks regularly destroy roads and railways."
