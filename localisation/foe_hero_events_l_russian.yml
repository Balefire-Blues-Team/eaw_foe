Watcher tells her she should find her virtue, the principle she'll stand by no matter what, and that there's a special set of virtues--loyalty, laughter, generosity, honesty, kindness, and magic--that she should keep an eye out for (or not if you ignored him). A charismatic stallion overrides the sprite-bots' music signal to deliver a speech about building a new Equestria. Littlepip tries to defend a caravan from a pegasus who she thinks is a raider (since he shot her) while he tries to defend the caravan from Littlepip, who he thinks is a raider since she's wearing raider armor.

One of the shops is a delivery service run by Ditzy Doo, the derpy zombie captive Littlepip saved from raiders. She was caught at the edge of a balefire bomb's blast when the war ended and became a ghoul. A skilled telekinetic offers to teach Littlepip to use her only magic well if she exterminates some monsters in Stable 24. Calamity joins her on the mission as a further apology. Stable 24 was subject to social tampering by Stable-Tec; they emphasized stallions' abilities with revised history and chauvinistic propaganda. Everyone in the Stable died from cat-snakes with wasp-like ovipositors known as Chimeras, created when a unicorn filly's magic epiphany accidentally fused three nearby animals. A monster lays eggs in Calamity and Littlepip braves an atrium full of the monsters with a one-use personal invisibility device (called a StealthBuck) to retrieve a cure the Stable ponies made in their last days. With Calamity saved, Littlepip leaves dynamite throughout the Stable and sets one bundle off to collapse the structure."

New Appleloosans say the "build a new Equestria" stallion is Red Eye. A radio in New Appleloosa plays DJ Pon3 Radio, mainly music with occasional news segments, the latest one reporting Littlepip's killing the Ponyville raiders and rescuing Ditzy. Littlepip learns that Appleloosa is a slaver town and it trades non-slave goods with New Appleloosa. Calamity gives her a Party-Time Mint-Al to boost her intelligence when she tries to convince some train ponies to attempt to rescue the slaves at Appleloosa. With the drug's help, the job is easy. While Calamity waits as a sniper for when things get hot, Littlepip sneaks into Appleloosa and finds an Applejack Statuette with "Be Strong!" engraved on the base. When she picks it up, she feels stronger and more confident. She's discovered by some isolated slavers and kills them. Then she finds Velvet Remedy singing for a crowd of slavers."

Hence the constantly overcast sky. Watcher explains that they sent Littlepip to the library hoping she would help the captives. Littlepip has seen some billboards for "Ministries", and asks Watcher what those were. Watcher says Celestia was protective of a group of six heroes and abdicated when the war got bad. Then Luna, who saw them as her saviours instead of as her children, put them in charge of their own government divisions. Our heroes spend the night at a rock farm whose only occupant is a Pinkie Pie-obsessed cheery filly named Pinkie Bell. Turns out she accidentally led ponies running an unpaid protection racket to her family and they were murdered slowly as an example to the area's rock farmers while she watched. Then she tried to be like Pinkie Pie, always happy, by imitating Pinkie's mannerisms, building a Pinkie Pie musuem, changing her name from Silver Bell to Pinkie Bell, painting her coat pink, and sawing off her own horn.

She sells him on a plan: have a Velvet Remedy concert during which she would shoot Gawd and miss Deadeyes' head, putting a bullet in the table, leaving everyone to think the slavers tried to kill both of the local leaders. At the concert, Deadeyes tells Littlepip that the stage has explosives in it that one of his employees will trigger if Littlepip shoots anywhere else than where they agreed. Littlepip telekinetically pushes Velvet backstage and then kills Deadeyes and puts a bullet next to Gawd. Slavers attack the fort early.

The alicorn directly picks it up with her telekinesis to toss the "grenade" away, is pulled into the memory, and goes limp as her shield drops. One easily killed alicorn later, Littlepip talks to the powered armor pony, SteelHooves. His armor is self-repairing but its spell matrix crashed. Littlepip agrees to fix it, but she needs a tool she doesn't have. SteelHooves says the tool she needs should be in the nearby Stable 29. They enter the Stable and discover that it was run by one of the Crusader Maneframes, the world's most powerful supercomputers; only three were ever made. It killed everyone in the Stable since the water talisman was damaged and its programming made it keep reducing the population to keep it within the amounts the deteriorating water supply could support.

Hellhounds ambush the alicorns by wonder-gluing magical energy mines to the underside of the landing pad. Velvet anesthetizes a painfully dying alicorn. She uses a disintegration ward spell on the team, which saves Calamity when a hellhound shoots a hole through his wing. The group heads to a hellhound town with a pre-war hospital so they can get medical supplies and fly away. Tainted plants dump spores on Littlepip, transferring taint to her. The Enclave had visited the hellhound town, and they built a failed sonic remote control for hellhounds."

The group visits Gawd for some reason. In Tenpony Tower, Littlepip wakes up from another addiction treatment after she used a PTM to convince Red Eye to do something. Her memory is full of holes in recent times. She had them removed into memory orbs by Tenpony doctor Life Bloom so the Goddess can't read her mind and see how she plans to kill her when she returns with the Black Book."

The group finds hospitality in a friendly Manehattan community, Arbu. The Steel Rangers try to kill the group instead of negotiating with them, and the group kills their powered armor troops. When Littlepip learns they're keeping two water talismans for themselves, the group tries to negotiate for them, but a fight breaks out and the other Rangers are slaughtered save two.

Alicorns have kidnapped some of the foals and taken them to Zebratown, a pre-war ghetto. Zebratown is right below Canterlot, and is contaminated with pink cloud. The pink cloud cuts off the Goddess's signal and the alicorns are hostile. Littlepip learns that zebras launched the megaspells because they believed ponies would kill them all if they won. The alicorns kidnapped the zebras to study their telepathic immunity. Nearly all the captives live to be rescued. The group fixes Glyphmark's drug lab (so they'll have something to trade) and repairs military robots lying around the town to act as guards. Xenith stays to teach the foals survival skills."

Littlepip goes into the castle and triggers a spell to turn the dragon who guards the Royal Treasury, who has eaten the gems composing the pink cloud producing megaspell, into a mouse. A shield around the headquarter's control center has a genetics-checking bypass spell for the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and admits Velvet since she's Sweetie Belle's direct descendant. Inside is a box of memory orbs marked with a burning hoof--the sign that Littlepip is watching. Littlepip watches the orbs. The Single Pony Project, designed by Stable-Tec, was built to control the weather and change the seasons under one pony's control, letting pegasi focus on the war effort.

Littlepip comprehends her own plan: She took an invisibility cloak from Gawd's griffins, used PTMs to convince Red Eye to use his balefire bomb on the Goddess, and had Xenith plant the balefire bomb while cloaked. Littlepip leaves the Black Book to its doom. Grand Pegasus Enclave diplomats arrive, offering the Goddess an alliance. After taking evasive maneuvers through a pool of alicorn potion, Littlepip goes into a bomb shelter designed to withstand a megaspell.

Littlepip, Calamity, and Ditzy meet an old Dashite who shows them a recording from the Ministry of Awesome HQ: Rainbow Dash bringing the memory orbs for Littlepip after the war and rigging the place to set off alarms in every Ministry of Awesome hub if anyone went in there again so that if Littlepip arrived she'd know. That means that the Enclave thought surfacers were after Ministry of Awesome technology, specifically the Single Pony Project, their only source of food. They then tried to set the Goddess against Red Eye, who they blamed for the intrusion, but when Littlepip killed their diplomats (including a High Council member) it was war. The group gets captured by the Enclave. The Enclave, who aim to end Red Eye's empire, attack New Appleloosa in retribution for their giving him the balefire bomb.

Her friends object to the part of this plan where she goes behind an incredibly strong force field, enters a coma-like state, and is separated from everyone who loves her, but they agree that it has to be done. Alicorns come to Velvet since she relieved an alicorn's pain once and ask her to help them by making male alicorns so their species can survive. She agrees to do it eventually.

Gawd's griffins clear the clouds over part of Manehattan. Ditzy soaks up radiation from Fillydelphia's centuries-old ground zero and radbooms over the city, clearing the clouds. The megaspell is cast and sunlight lasers destroy both sides' more devastating equipment, leaving them just with infantry. The force field around the Single Pony Project, which even the Enclave can't penetrate, was set to only allow Rainbow Dash and the Princesses passage. Littlepip thinks that since she's mostly alicorn and has a perfect image of Dash's soul, she can get through. She can't.

Celestia fled Canterlot once Luna died and, knowing that she was dying, uploaded her mind and poured her soul into the Single Pony Project's Crusader Maneframe. Rainbow Dash had the maneframe disconnected from weather control since she hated the mind-in-a-computer stuff, so Celestia could only watch the Wasteland through the tower cameras.
