 shatteredhoof.1.t:0 "The History of Shattered Hoof"
 shatteredhoof.1.d:0 "The Shattered Hoof Re-Education Facility was a prison and labor camp established by the Ministry of Morale during the war. The facility was named after Shattered Hoof Ridge, the site of the attempted assasination of Princess Celestia by Zebrican forces. Fittingly, many of the prisoners initially incarcerated here were those found to have been involved in the plot to assasinate the Princess.\n The facility and it's inmates were used to mine gems to help fuel both the war effort and Equestria's research. As valuable as gems are, they are only edible to dragons. As a result, the facilities occupants found themselves without food following the end of The War. This resulted in them resorting to cannibalism, and later raiding, to get by.\nA mere month before the megaspells hit, Shattered Hoof was affected by a mandate from the Ministry of Morale. They had to..."
 shatteredhoof.1.a:0 "...house more prisoners."
 shatteredhoof.1.b:0 "...make sure all of their guards were armed."
 shatteredhoof.1.c:0 "...expand their facilities."
 
 shatteredhoof.2.t:0 "Our Initial Expansion"
 shatteredhoof.2.d:0 "The Shattered Hoof inmates were nothing but a disorganized mob, with no plans and no future. This changed when one of the inmates, with help from a mysterious benefactor only known as Mister Topaz, managed to bring them all together and organize them into a coherent force. From there, he struck out into the wasteland, securing food and supplies alike via taking them from others. \n During this time, the Shattered Hoof Raiders would become a force that was both respected and feared throughout all of Southern Equestria. Their territory rapidly expanded, and more and more ponies found themselves having to submit to the fearsome raider gang. \n However, it was not all raiding and plundering. On the orders of their benefactor, the Shattered Hoof Raiders also set about..."
 shatteredhoof.2.a:0 "...clearing the local ruins."
 shatteredhoof.2.b:0 "...repairing the roads."
 shatteredhoof.2.c:0 "...scavenging Clearwater Harbor."
 
 shatteredhoof.3.t:0 "The Push Towards the Azureway"
 shatteredhoof.3.d:0 "Following their southern triumphs, the Shattered Hoof Raiders underwent a long period of stagnation. This led to a number of internal conflicts, and eventually escalated into a small-scale civil war between different factions within the gang. This conflict ended with the forceful reunification of the raiders by one cunning gang member named Deadeyes, who managed to contact and recieve the backing of Mister Topaz. As part of his plan to ensure the gang remained united under him, Deadeyes set about conquering much of the land to the north of Shattered Hoof. \nDuring this time, Deadeyes recieved an order from his benefactor. He was to..."
 shatteredhoof.3.a:0 "...centralize their assets."
 shatteredhoof.3.b:0 "...settle the coast."
 shatteredhoof.3.c:0 "...build up Green Crossing."
 
 shatteredhoof.4.t:0 "Gawdina Grimfeather and her Company"
 shatteredhoof.4.d:0 "During the war, griffons made a living as mercenaries, selling their services to either side with little to no regard to their actual causes and beliefs. This would create a tradition that has been maintained ever since, with most griffons across the wasteland still serving as mercenaries to this day.\n One of the largest mercenary companies active during the war was known as The Talons. Following the war, The Talons split off into many different mercenary bands, though many still kept the name. One of these successor operations is currently known as Gawd's Talons, named for their leader, Gawdyna Grimfeather.\nGawd's Talons were hired by Deadeyes, on behalf of Mister Topaz, to help secure the now extensive territory that Shattered Hoof controls. Though there were many different mercenary bands competing for the Shattered Hoof contract, Gawd's Talons stood out as particularly useful due to their..."

 shatteredhoof.5.d:0 "It’s that wonderful time again where we do the rounds on a local settlement. Easy picking as always. As much fun as it would be to take everything, we do have to leave them with enough to pay us next time.\n\nThis leaves us with three choices. We take the caps, buy ourselves something nice, it does leave less for them, not that they needed it. Take their guns, saves us making or buying them, besides it’s better if we make sure they can’t fight back. Raiding does cost lives however, so we might take some captives to fill our raiding parties, also making sure they can’t get enough settlers to fight us.\nWhatever our choice is we’ll benefit. We’ll be back later for more as always"

The Battle of Shattered Hoof has cost many lives, but that is not where our peril ends.\nOur forces are in disarray, and we have lost control of much of the countryside. In addition, as they retreated, the Slavers destroyed roads and bridges, burned fields and houses and generally crippled our economy. Even now, there are still reports of pockets of Slavers roaming the Countryside and making trouble.\nWe are in a dire situation indeed!"
 shatteredhoof.6.a:0 "At least we're alive"
 
 shatteredhoof.7.t:0 "Leslie Raiders seize the moment"
 shatteredhoof.7.d:0 "While we were still recovering from the Battle of Shattered Hoof, and running engagements with Slavers are still raging throughout our country, we received alarming reports from several Outposts on the Eastern Border:\nRaiders from Leslie are advancing into our territory in unusually organized fashion, seemingly intending to use our moment of weakness to seize the border-region.\nSadly, we simply do not have the capacity to stop them at the moment, but we won't forget this..."
