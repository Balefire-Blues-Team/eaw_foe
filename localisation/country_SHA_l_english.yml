 shatteredhoof.1.t:0 "The History of Shattered Hoof"
 shatteredhoof.1.d:0 "The Shattered Hoof Re-Education Facility was a prison and labor camp established by the Ministry of Morale during the war. The facility was named after Shattered Hoof Ridge, the site of the attempted assasination of Princess Celestia by Zebrican forces. Fittingly, many of the prisoners initially incarcerated here were those found to have been involved in the plot to assasinate the Princess.\n The facility and it's inmates were used to mine gems to help fuel both the war effort and Equestria's research. As valuable as gems are, they are only edible to dragons. As a result, the facilities occupants found themselves without food following the end of The War. This resulted in them resorting to cannibalism, and later raiding, to get by.\nA mere month before the megaspells hit, Shattered Hoof was affected by a mandate from the Ministry of Morale. They had to..."
 shatteredhoof.1.a:0 "...house more prisoners."
 shatteredhoof.1.b:0 "...make sure all of their guards were armed."
 shatteredhoof.1.c:0 "...expand their facilities."
 
 shatteredhoof.2.t:0 "Our Initial Expansion"
 shatteredhoof.2.d:0 "The Shattered Hoof inmates were nothing but a disorganized mob, with no plans and no future. This changed when one of the inmates, with help from a mysterious benefactor only known as Mister Topaz, managed to bring them all together and organize them into a coherent force. From there, he struck out into the wasteland, securing food and supplies alike via taking them from others. \n During this time, the Shattered Hoof Raiders would become a force that was both respected and feared throughout all of Southern Equestria. Their territory rapidly expanded, and more and more ponies found themselves having to submit to the fearsome raider gang. \n However, it was not all raiding and plundering. On the orders of their benefactor, the Shattered Hoof Raiders also set about..."
 shatteredhoof.2.a:0 "...clearing the local ruins."
 shatteredhoof.2.b:0 "...repairing the roads."
 shatteredhoof.2.c:0 "...scavenging Clearwater Harbor."
 
 shatteredhoof.3.t:0 "The Push Towards the Azureway"
 shatteredhoof.3.d:0 "Following their southern triumphs, the Shattered Hoof Raiders underwent a long period of stagnation. This led to a number of internal conflicts, and eventually escalated into a small-scale civil war between different factions within the gang. This conflict ended with the forceful reunification of the raiders by one cunning gang member named Deadeyes, who managed to contact and recieve the backing of Mister Topaz. As part of his plan to ensure the gang remained united under him, Deadeyes set about conquering much of the land to the north of Shattered Hoof. \nDuring this time, Deadeyes recieved an order from his benefactor. He was to..."
 shatteredhoof.3.a:0 "...centralize their assets."
 shatteredhoof.3.b:0 "...settle the coast."
 shatteredhoof.3.c:0 "...build up Green Crossing."
 
 shatteredhoof.4.t:0 "Gawdina Grimfeather and her Company"
 shatteredhoof.4.d:0 "During the war, griffons made a living as mercenaries, selling their services to either side with little to no regard to their actual causes and beliefs. This would create a tradition that has been maintained ever since, with most griffons across the wasteland still serving as mercenaries to this day.\n One of the largest mercenary companies active during the war was known as The Talons. Following the war, The Talons split off into many different mercenary bands, though many still kept the name. One of these successor operations is currently known as Gawd's Talons, named for their leader, Gawdyna Grimfeather.\nGawd's Talons were hired by Deadeyes, on behalf of Mister Topaz, to help secure the now extensive territory that Shattered Hoof controls. Though there were many different mercenary bands competing for the Shattered Hoof contract, Gawd's Talons stood out as particularly useful due to their..."
 shatteredhoof.4.a:0 "...focus on urban combat."
 shatteredhoof.4.b:0 "...focus on siege warfare."
 shatteredhoof.4.c:0 "...focus on large-front offensives."
 
 shatteredhoof.5.t:0 "Taking what is due"
 shatteredhoof.5.d:0 "It’s that wonderful time again where we do the rounds on a local settlement. Easy picking as always. As much fun as it would be to take everything, we do have to leave them with enough to pay us next time.\n\nThis leaves us with three choices. We take the caps, buy ourselves something nice, it does leave less for them, not that they needed it. Take their guns, saves us making or buying them, besides it’s better if we make sure they can’t fight back. Raiding does cost lives however, so we might take some captives to fill our raiding parties, also making sure they can’t get enough settlers to fight us.\nWhatever our choice is we’ll benefit. We’ll be back later for more as always"
 shatteredhoof.5.a:0 "Caps"
 shatteredhoof.5.b:0 "Guns"
 shatteredhoof.5.c:0 "Recruits"
 
 shatteredhoof.6.t:0 "The Aftermath"
 shatteredhoof.6.d:0 "Following the attack on our lands by RedEyes forces, chaos reigns in the countryside. The Battle of Shattered Hoof has cost many lives, but that is not where our peril ends.\nOur forces are in disarray, and we have lost control of much of the countryside. In addition, as they retreated, the Slavers destroyed roads and bridges, burned fields and houses and generally crippled our economy.

It would help rid the territory of Shattered Hoof of criminals as well as creating a buffer state that would be in the way of The Enclave reaching the heart of Shattered Hoof. The set-back is that we would not be able to fully operate any sort of industry in the region of Leslie due to the simple fact that it would be a hotbed of Shattered Hoof’s criminals."

This new government will help all of us to protect each other from the evils of the wasteland and to better our lives, so that we may reclaim some part of what was lost in The Great War. It is also one of many stepping stones on the way towards a truly united and democratic Equestria. The idea of freedom, friendship, and the pursuit of harmony. One of my first acts for this Provisional Republic is to organize free elections in which you, the citizens, are able to choose your leaders. These elections will be held as soon as the Republic is in no imminent danger”\n\nThis was a small part of a speech that gave hope to many across the lands of Azuria and beyond, as they are beginning to feel that the era of suffering in the wasteland is finally nearing its end."

The Proposal recommends that we also hold a vote to our citizens on whether or not we should unify with Azuria.

 shatteredhoof_ncr.2.d:0 "A monumental event in Equestrian history has occurred in the settlement of Junktiontown, Gawdyna Grimfeather, in a speech to her following, along with many wasteland heroes including the famed Littlepip and her friends, has declared the establishment of The New Canterlot Republic, a true successor to the Princessdom of Equestria that had perished in the Great War over 200 years ago.\nThe declaration came after Shattered Hoof, or the Provisional Republic of Azuria, had emerged victorious from countless struggles from mighty wasteland titans such as RedEye, the menace that was Mr. Topaz, The Unity, and the overhead monster that was The Enclave. Many lands surrounding Shattered Hoof had come together under the leadership of Gawdyna in an alliance to fend off these foes and eventually had agreed to become united under the banner of the Republic. It had become evident in the end that a new power would emerge in Azuria, one that will shape Equus’s history for many years to come.\nFollowing the declaration Gawdyna had proposed a constitution, a document that lays out the rights of the creatures who reside in the NCR and followed by laws that would shape the structure of the government and how law and order should be installed in the wasteland. The most prominent of these rights were the Freedom of speech, which allows citizens to speak freely without punishment from the government. Another was Freedom of the press, which allows news publications, which would soon take form in the NCR, to speak freely and unbiasedly of the happenings of the country and more. Another was Freedom of Religion, which allows a variety of religions to prosper without persecution. Another key right of the constitution was the ability for the citizens to vote for their leaders from Governors all the way to the President. These rights and many more gave the common Equestrian more freedom in their lands than they have ever experienced in the history of Equestria. It was to give the common pony more say in their government and country, as well as help ensure that the faults of the Diarchy would never happen again.\nThe Flag of the NCR was decided of a horizontal tri-color design with a symbol of Celestia’s sun in the middle with Luna’s moon in the middle of that, the symbol was a tribute to the efforts of the Diarch of protecting Equestria and its prosperity even though it didn’t last. The tri-color was a purple, white, and blue, with the shade of light purple dedicated to the republic, white for the promise of restoring the lands of the wasteland to what it once was, and blue for the Azureway, the lifeblood of the NCR’s trade and economy. The new flag was hoisted high above New Canterlot, the new name for Junktiontown created by Gawdyna herself.\nNews of the creation of the NCR and its ideas and promises spread quickly across the wasteland, and soon after thousands of ponies and other creatures were packing their bags and heading from every corner of the wasteland to the NCR, hoping of making a new and grand life for themselves and their loved ones. The future is uncertain for the young Republic, but in time it will be known that the birth of the New Canterlot Republic will mark the beginning of a great or terrible chapter in Equestrian history."

 shatteredhoof_ncr.4.d:0 "One of the burdens that our citizens are feeling is that the lands of the NCR, once various different countries, are vastly different from each other in the matters of the functions of economy, military, and governing. Many have complained that the sudden integration of all these economies and more has hindered the daily lives of many in one way or another, and that the merging of these vastly different lands will make operations difficult. The merging of the economies and militaries will be a high priority of the NCR government as it begins to get its bearings on the country, but the setbacks of the merge will be felt across the NCR for years to come."

 shatteredhoof_ncr.6.d:0 "A historic moment has taken place today in Equestrian history. The NCR, de-facto successor to Equestria, has just held its first election for the position for its president. It was not without controversy, as there was only one candidate for the position at the time; Gawdyna Grimfeather, the griffoness who masterminded the creation of the NCR months after the historic Battle of Shattered Hoof. Many across the NCR thought that the election was a sham and utterly pointless, as there was only one candidate to vote for. Despite this the election went off without a hitch as ballots were set up at communities across the NCR and votes rolled in. To no one’s surprise Gawdyna and her newly formed United Republican Party secured 100% of the votes.\n“As I stand here a figurehead in not just a bold new nation, but a figurehead of Equestrian history that will be remembered for centuries, I feel obliged to tell you all that I will do everything in my power and the power of all who watch before me and those hearing from radios across the country, to reach the true potential of this new nation and to bring forth a new era in Equestrian history. One that is not plagued with the struggles of the wasteland and the legacies of friendship, harmony, and prosperity restored.”\n That was just a small portion of an ‘inauguration’ speech given by Gawdyna shortly after the election. Celebrations across the country and especially within Gawdyna’s URP were held shortly after this speech wrapped up. Time will tell what great things Gawdyna has planned for the NCR, and it is certain that the entirety of the Equestrian wasteland will know of President Gawdyna Grimfeather."

His policies mostly focus on helping folks fleeing tyrannical countries such as Red Eye’s Slaver empire, as well as other raider and slave states that dot the wasteland. Olive Branch is against using the NCR military for expansion and offensive wars and would rather use it to help creatures across the wasteland reach the relative safety and freedom of the NCR. His plans for the economy entail a massive expansion of consumer-industries as well as the complete Overhaul of the Education system.\nWhile the party is small compared to the URP and mostly composed of pacifistic civilians and government officials, it has the potential to reach many ponies thanks to the freedoms of the NCR."

Governor Rock Solid, Governor of the state of Leslie, has split off a third of the EAP with him to form the United for Peace Coalition. This has occurred as a response to an argument between Olive Branch and Rock Solid days after the creation of the EAP. The details of the argument are still unknown but what is made paramount is that the argument mostly involved what the NCR military would be used for by the EAP. As Rock Solid had stated that the aims of the UfPC was to use the NCR military to help keep a balance of power in the wasteland by holding back the ambitions of hostile powers through “Aggressive Pacifism”, as well as holding diplomatic talks to help ease tensions between nations. The future of the UPC is uncertain, but what is certain is that this brings an interesting change to the balance of power in the NCR."

This has shocked many among the government and civilian populace as Steel Wall, while a good military commander, is not the type to really be engaged with politics. It has been found out that the likely reason for the formation of the PL was the majority of those who support Steel Wall are Ex-Enclave Pegasi who seek their own political party, using Steel Wall as a strongarm militaristic figurehead. What the PL seeks to achieve is immense growth of the military industrial complex coupled with an overhaul and expansion of the NCR military, and using it to seize territories across the wasteland by force. Their emphasis of using extreme military force has gained them very little support from those outside of extreme militants and Ex-Enclave.\n\nIt would take a crisis from within and without for the Patriotic League to gain the support of enough of the populace to actually take control of the government and achieve what Steel Wall wishes. While he’s still fiercely loyal to the NCR and its military, the nature of his Patriotic League and its support base is putting his reputation and position in the military into question."

On the other hand there are those, mainly within the PL and the EAP, who support a policy of rapprochement. Rather than punishing all of the Enclave Military personnel, it calls to only punish the leaders and have soldiers and junior-officers be granted citizenship within our country.
