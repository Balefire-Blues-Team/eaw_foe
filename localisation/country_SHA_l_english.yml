 NCR_lumber_from_radshore_desc:0 "Greenline used to be a major producer and exporter of quality lumber before the bombs fell. Unfortunately, the last two centuries haven't been the kindest to Equestria's lumber industry, and as a result the locals have largely left the lumberyards abandoned.

 NCR_the_war_to_free_the_sun_desc:0 "For over two centuries now, the sight of the sun has been a rarity thanks to the pegasi's cloud layer.

 shatteredhoof.1.t:0 "The History of Shattered Hoof"
 shatteredhoof.1.d:0 "The Shattered Hoof Re-Education Facility was a prison and labor camp established by the Ministry of Morale during the war. The facility was named after Shattered Hoof Ridge, the site of the attempted assasination of Princess Celestia by Zebrican forces. Fittingly, many of the prisoners initially incarcerated here were those found to have been involved in the plot to assasinate the Princess.\n The facility and it's inmates were used to mine gems to help fuel both the war effort and Equestria's research. As valuable as gems are, they are only edible to dragons. As a result, the facilities occupants found themselves without food following the end of The War. This resulted in them resorting to cannibalism, and later raiding, to get by.\nA mere month before the megaspells hit, Shattered Hoof was affected by a mandate from the Ministry of Morale. They had to..."
 shatteredhoof.1.a:0 "...house more prisoners."
 shatteredhoof.1.b:0 "...make sure all of their guards were armed."
 shatteredhoof.1.c:0 "...expand their facilities."
 
 shatteredhoof.2.t:0 "Our Initial Expansion"
 shatteredhoof.2.d:0 "The Shattered Hoof inmates were nothing but a disorganized mob, with no plans and no future. This changed when one of the inmates, with help from a mysterious benefactor only known as Mister Topaz, managed to bring them all together and organize them into a coherent force. From there, he struck out into the wasteland, securing food and supplies alike via taking them from others. \n During this time, the Shattered Hoof Raiders would become a force that was both respected and feared throughout all of Southern Equestria. Their territory rapidly expanded, and more and more ponies found themselves having to submit to the fearsome raider gang. \n However, it was not all raiding and plundering. On the orders of their benefactor, the Shattered Hoof Raiders also set about..."
 shatteredhoof.2.a:0 "...clearing the local ruins."
 shatteredhoof.2.b:0 "...repairing the roads."
 shatteredhoof.2.c:0 "...scavenging Clearwater Harbor."
 
 shatteredhoof.3.t:0 "The Push Towards the Azureway"
 shatteredhoof.3.d:0 "Following their southern triumphs, the Shattered Hoof Raiders underwent a long period of stagnation. This led to a number of internal conflicts, and eventually escalated into a small-scale civil war between different factions within the gang. This conflict ended with the forceful reunification of the raiders by one cunning gang member named Deadeyes, who managed to contact and recieve the backing of Mister Topaz. As part of his plan to ensure the gang remained united under him, Deadeyes set about conquering much of the land to the north of Shattered Hoof. \nDuring this time, Deadeyes recieved an order from his benefactor. He was to..."
 shatteredhoof.3.a:0 "...centralize their assets."
 shatteredhoof.3.b:0 "...settle the coast."
 shatteredhoof.3.c:0 "...build up Green Crossing."
 
 shatteredhoof.4.t:0 "Gawdyna Grimfeather and her Company"
 shatteredhoof.4.d:0 "During the war, griffons made a living as mercenaries, selling their services to either side with little to no regard to their actual causes and beliefs. This would create a tradition that has been maintained ever since, with most griffons across the wasteland still serving as mercenaries to this day.\n One of the largest mercenary companies active during the war was known as The Talons. Following the war, The Talons split off into many different mercenary bands, though many still kept the name. One of these successor operations is currently known as Gawd's Talons, named for their leader, Gawdyna Grimfeather.\nGawd's Talons were hired by Deadeyes, on behalf of Mister Topaz, to help secure the now extensive territory that Shattered Hoof controls. Though there were many different mercenary bands competing for the Shattered Hoof contract, Gawd's Talons stood out as particularly useful due to their..."
 shatteredhoof.4.a:0 "...focus on urban combat."
 shatteredhoof.4.b:0 "...focus on siege warfare."
 shatteredhoof.4.c:0 "...focus on large-front offensives."
 
 shatteredhoof.5.t:0 "Taking what is due"
 shatteredhoof.5.d:0 "It’s that wonderful time again where we do the rounds on a local settlement. Easy picking as always. As much fun as it would be to take everything, we do have to leave them with enough to pay us next time.\n\nThis leaves us with three choices. We take the caps, buy ourselves something nice, it does leave less for them, not that they needed it. Take their guns, saves us making or buying them, besides it’s better if we make sure they can’t fight back. Raiding does cost lives however, so we might take some captives to fill our raiding parties, also making sure they can’t get enough settlers to fight us.\nWhatever our choice is we’ll benefit. We’ll be back later for more as always"
 shatteredhoof.5.a:0 "Caps"
 shatteredhoof.5.b:0 "Guns"
 shatteredhoof.5.c:0 "Recruits"
 
 shatteredhoof.6.t:0 "The Aftermath"
 shatteredhoof.6.d:0 "Following the attack on our lands by RedEyes forces, chaos reigns in the countryside. The Battle of Shattered Hoof has cost many lives, but that is not where our peril ends.\nOur forces are in disarray, and we have lost control of much of the countryside. In addition, as they retreated, the Slavers destroyed roads and bridges, burned fields and houses and generally crippled our economy. Even now, there are still reports of pockets of Slavers roaming the Countryside and making trouble.\nWe are in a dire situation indeed!"
 shatteredhoof.6.a:0 "At least we're alive"
 
 shatteredhoof.7.t:0 "Leslie Raiders seize the moment"
 shatteredhoof.7.d:0 "While we were still recovering from the Battle of Shattered Hoof, and running engagements with Slavers are still raging throughout our country, we received alarming reports from several Outposts on the Eastern Border:\nRaiders from Leslie are advancing into our territory in unusually organized fashion, seemingly intending to use our moment of weakness to seize the border-region.\nSadly, we simply do not have the capacity to stop them at the moment, but we won't forget this..."
 shatteredhoof.7.a:0 "We will have our Revenge!"

 shatteredhoof_ncr.2.d:0 "A monumental event in Equestrian history has occurred in the settlement of Junktiontown, Gawdyna Grimfeather, in a speech to her following, along with many wasteland heroes including the famed Littlepip and her friends, has declared the establishment of The New Canterlot Republic, a true successor to the Princessdom of Equestria that had perished in the Great War over 200 years ago.\nThe declaration came after Shattered Hoof, or the Provisional Republic of Azuria, had emerged victorious from countless struggles from mighty wasteland titans such as RedEye, the menace that was Mr. Topaz, The Unity, and the overhead monster that was The Enclave. Many lands surrounding Shattered Hoof had come together under the leadership of Gawdyna in an alliance to fend off these foes and eventually had agreed to become united under the banner of the Republic. It had become evident in the end that a new power would emerge in Azuria, one that will shape Equus’s history for many years to come.\nFollowing the declaration Gawdyna had proposed a constitution, a document that lays out the rights of the creatures who reside in the NCR and followed by laws that would shape the structure of the government and how law and order should be installed in the wasteland. The most prominent of these rights were the Freedom of speech, which allows citizens to speak freely without punishment from the government. Another was Freedom of the press, which allows news publications, which would soon take form in the NCR, to speak freely and unbiasedly of the happenings of the country and more. Another was Freedom of Religion, which allows a variety of religions to prosper without persecution. Another key right of the constitution was the ability for the citizens to vote for their leaders from Governors all the way to the President. These rights and many more gave the common Equestrian more freedom in their lands than they have ever experienced in the history of Equestria. It was to give the common pony more say in their government and country, as well as help ensure that the faults of the Diarchy would never happen again.\nThe Flag of the NCR was decided of a horizontal tri-color design with a symbol of Celestia’s sun in the middle with Luna’s moon in the middle of that, the symbol was a tribute to the efforts of the Diarch of protecting Equestria and its prosperity even though it didn’t last. The tri-color was a purple, white, and blue, with the shade of light purple dedicated to the republic, white for the promise of restoring the lands of the wasteland to what it once was, and blue for the Azureway, the lifeblood of the NCR’s trade and economy. The new flag was hoisted high above New Canterlot, the new name for Junktiontown created by Gawdyna herself.\nNews of the creation of the NCR and its ideas and promises spread quickly across the wasteland, and soon after thousands of ponies and other creatures were packing their bags and heading from every corner of the wasteland to the NCR, hoping of making a new and grand life for themselves and their loved ones. The future is uncertain for the young Republic, but in time it will be known that the birth of the New Canterlot Republic will mark the beginning of a great or terrible chapter in Equestrian history."

The merging of the economies and militaries will be a high priority of the NCR government as it begins to get its bearings on the country, but the setbacks of the merge will be felt across the NCR for years to come."

It was not without controversy, as there was only one candidate for the position at the time; Gawdyna Grimfeather, the griffoness who masterminded the creation of the NCR months after the historic Battle of Shattered Hoof. Many across the NCR thought that the election was a sham and utterly pointless, as there was only one candidate to vote for. Despite this the election went off without a hitch as ballots were set up at communities across the NCR and votes rolled in. To no one’s surprise Gawdyna and her newly formed United Republican Party secured 100% of the votes.\n“As I stand here a figurehead in not just a bold new nation, but a figurehead of Equestrian history that will be remembered for centuries, I feel obliged to tell you all that I will do everything in my power and the power of all who watch before me and those hearing from radios across the country, to reach the true potential of this new nation and to bring forth a new era in Equestrian history. One that is not plagued with the struggles of the wasteland and the legacies of friendship, harmony, and prosperity restored.”\n That was just a small portion of an ‘inauguration’ speech given by Gawdyna shortly after the election. Celebrations across the country and especially within Gawdyna’s URP were held shortly after this speech wrapped up. Time will tell what great things Gawdyna has planned for the NCR, and it is certain that the entirety of the Equestrian wasteland will know of President Gawdyna Grimfeather."

The details of the argument are still unknown but what is made paramount is that the argument mostly involved what the NCR military would be used for by the EAP.

It has been found out that the likely reason for the formation of the PL was the majority of those who support Steel Wall are Ex-Enclave Pegasi who seek their own political party, using Steel Wall as a strongarm militaristic figurehead. What the PL seeks to achieve is immense growth of the military industrial complex coupled with an overhaul and expansion of the NCR military, and using it to seize territories across the wasteland by force. Their emphasis of using extreme military force has gained them very little support from those outside of extreme militants and Ex-Enclave.\n\nIt would take a crisis from within and without for the Patriotic League to gain the support of enough of the populace to actually take control of the government and achieve what Steel Wall wishes. While he’s still fiercely loyal to the NCR and its military, the nature of his Patriotic League and its support base is putting his reputation and position in the military into question."

There was no time for somepony else to contest Gawdyna’s candidacy, nor was there any dedication of her wanting to hold a fair and open election, just empty promises, it seemed that she was more concerned getting it over with and taking the reigns as quickly as possible with no concern that there are those that are not supportive of her leadership. Her history as a mercenary for a ruthless slaver is proof that her causes were more in line with her personal quest for glory and power and not the betterment of the wasteland‘s people, thus her presidency is greatly immoral and illegitimate…\n\n…The absurdity that a griffon now rules over our nation, a pony majority country, greatly undermines the true representations of the NCR and is a direct threat to the largest demographic of our nation. It is vital that this griffon resigns from her post and allows for better representation to take form in our country and for true leaders to take the reigns, not some petty gun for hire with ambitions for power and wealth. If this mercenary ever dares to run for her next term; then I will take those who agree with what I have told you, and split from this illegitimate party to undermine the questionable aims of this griffon.”\n\nThese were some of the most important notions from an hour long declaration from the Secretary of Treasury that Gawdyna’s Presidency is illegitimate, and that if she runs for the next election Waterworks will split the party and create a splinter faction within the URP known as the Free Ponies Party. What followed after the speech was cries of various support, some called Waterworks a traitor among other slurs, while some praised his words, crying that Gawdyna is a traitor to the NCR’s ideals and she should resign. Things grew chaotic with Military Police sent to settle things down. It’s unclear what may follow from this drastic turn of events, but what is clear is that the foundations of Gawdyna’s Presidency and her party might be starting to crumble."

On the other hand there are those, mainly within the PL and the EAP, who support a policy of rapprochement.

As the all clear is given, the unicorns begin casting what may very well be one of the most complex spells to be created since the War.

 shatteredhoof_ncr.1614.d:0 "With the war concluded, the NCR calls for a peace conference to draw the lines for our new borders. The chosen (yet barely accommodating) conference room is soon filled with representatives from both parties. They’ve come prepared and seem quite familiar to peacemaking, as a NCR rep. lays open a map of the Sunrise Region on the conference table, with the borders of our states are marked in our respective colors. Discussion begins to fill the room as both parties introduce their desires out of this meeting, valuing the resources that lay temporarily unclaimed. Our own Tenpony representatives try to push for our goals and steer the meeting in our favor, but it proves quite difficult; the NCR are no strangers to diplomacy. \n\nAfter an hour of back-and-forth peddling, an NCR official finally steps forward, the room quieting in anticipation. \n\n “Alright, we’ve discussed enough.” \n\n He turns and eyes his colleagues behind him, followed by a glance at their map, at the region they’ve marked as Tenpony. \n\n “For your efforts… Tenpony will receive the Rain Rider Lands. The NCR will acquire the rest of the region. Does this sound feasible?"

 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.1.t:0 "In the Ruins of the Enclave"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.1.d:0 "Neighvarro used to be a wartime airforce-base situated west of Baltimare that was used by the Enclave as their primary base of operations across the Equestrian Heartlands. It was also vital to the future plans of the Enclave, as Neighvarro is the home of the Single Pegasus Project Maneframe which, in theory, gives one control over the weather patterns across most of the Equestrian Continent. The Enclave used the limited access they had to the SPP to maintain a constant cloud cover over the entire wasteland since the Great War. It was here that they began their Conquest of the Wasteland and also the place where they ultimately surrendered. Now the base lies in ruins after the Battle of Neighvarro and the dispersal of the “New Cloudsdale” Enclave across the wasteland.\nWith Neighvarro under our control we can now freely explore what remains of the base to discover all of its secrets and take advantage of what technology was left behind. An army of hired scavengers, explorers, and scientific minds were dispatched to dig into the base of Neighvarro and especially the SPP facility. After the remnants of Neighvarro’s automated security systems and independent Scavengers were dealt with by NCR troops every piece of technology and data that could be gathered was collected and catalogued to be studied and used for the NCR’s benefit.\nAmong the best finds were several damaged blueprints for energy-weapons, an entire room full of X0-2 Powered Armour, and a virtual treasure trove of memory orbs the Enclave must have used to train Pilots.\nThe most intriguing find however, was made by a team of explorers, who discovered what seemed to be a large room, surrounded by an impervious energy shield, at the heart of the base. Attempts to disable the shield have been unsuccessful as there seems to be no clear way of disabling it without damaging what lies behind the shield. What’s even more perplexing is that the shield itself is not connected to the main reactor of the facility which means whatever is powering it lies inside the shield. It’s theorized that the heart of the SPP’s functions and purpose is what lies inside the shield, but until we find a safe way to penetrate it, whatever secrets lie inside that shield will remain a mystery."

 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.2.t:0 "The Secrets of Hill 431"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.2.d:0 "On a hill dubbed ‘Hill 431’ lies a seemingly ordinary bunker used by the Equestrian Military before the Great War, due to its proximity to Canterlot it must have been designed as a part of an extended defense system for the former Equestrian Capital. What became of the bunker after the war was that a dispatch of a Talon Company had set up shop inside the bunker and that they had abandoned it a few years prior for reasons unknown. Now that the bunker is under our administration we should clear it and see if the Talons had left behind anything interesting and afterwards use the bunker as a NCR military base.\nExplorers that had been sent there have discovered massive rooms untouched by the Talons filled with Pre-war weaponry and munitions from regular infantry uniforms and rifles to power armor and gatling lasers. What came as a surprise was the discovery of a massive reinforced steel door leading to a floor that was not mentioned in the bunker’s schematics.\nWhen the door was opened our team had to venture along seemingly endless tunnels filled with robotic security systems and dozens of face doors and traps. But finally, they found the correct entrance.\nThe team was surprised to find a truly gigantic laboratory with pods filled with bodies of every creature from simple ponies and griffons, to changelings and even Dragons, all preserved from whatever wartime experiments were conducted here. The lab was filled to the brim with strange equipment and technology used for biomagical and biomechanical work. While the research seems very arcane by today's standards, our Scientists hypothesize, that this lab was researching a way to transfer the minds of somepony captured within a “Souljar” into synthetic bodies. The evidence suggests that this laboratory was run in cooperation by the MAS and the MOI. We are not sure if the experiments ever saw success, as much of the later research data has been expunged, but it is nevertheless an intriguing prospect. Some of the surviving notes also propose introducing a forced magical change within a Changeling Drone, to make its body assume the form of an Alicorn permanently. However, this was designated a failure, as apparently, the “Synthetic Alicorns” had less magical throughput than those of “Project Unity”\nIt’s unknown if this research will ever prove useful to us or why it was developed during the war, but we’ll keep digging."

 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.3.t:0 "A Ministry’s secrets"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.3.d:0 "This stable we have come across is simply extraordinary: it’s apparent that these Stableponies truly believed themselves to be the Ministry of Arcane Sciences and had continued the “Ministry” long after the war, remaining isolated from the rest of the world much like the Enclave. And sadly, like the Enclave we had to wage war against the inhabitants of this stable to get to its secrets. After the smoke cleared nearly all of the stable’s inhabitants had died either doggidly fighting us to the last, or commiting suicide within their rooms, with their Minister having shot himself in his office. Those few who survived were apprehended and taken in for questioning or given citizenship for the civilian types of the surviving inhabitants.\nWhen exploring the stable itself it appeared that most of the technology and research was destroyed in the fighting or was intentionally destroyed in a scorched earth effort. We have managed to retrieve a small amount of their research files and also decent amounts of advanced weaponry that this stable had developed over the last 200 years, including a schematic for a tank that they appear to have designed themselves post-war. What surprised us was that the stable also had large amounts of wasteland items mostly those used by slavers. It appears that this stable had ventured into the wasteland before and had taken many items back with them to perhaps study the ins and outs of the wasteland, despite much of what they studied to be some of the wasteland’s worst.\nA couple of days after we managed to take what’s valuable an explosion ripped the stable apart killing most of those left behind to hold the stable and rendering it naught but a smoking ruin. It is assumed that the main reactor of the stable had been rigged to explode and had been set on a delayed charge either on purpose or not. It is a sad day for the NCR, as hundreds of innocent lives and a stable in pristine condition were lost forever."

 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.4.t:0 "The Lair of a false Goddess"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.4.d:0 "Maripony used to be a MAS base where some of the most vile biological experiments of the war were carried out under Twilight Sparkle. It was here that the fabled ‘Goddess’ turned countless ponies into the hive minded army of alicorns that terrorized the Wastes. It was also here that the famed Twilight Sparkle had met her end and had presumably become part of the ‘Goddess’. Now the facility that was once an engine of terror lies in near complete ruin, with most of the facility having been bombed rubble with only a few intact rooms. It was dangerous work clearing the rubble and getting a crew to extract anything valuable but our crews managed it eventually.\nExploring what's left of Maripony yielded little but we managed to recover pieces of what was used to hold IMP and some fragments of data on the research of it. As for the substance itself, all of the vats of IMP were destroyed and we have only managed to recover small amounts of it, in total maybe 2 Litres, that were sent to New Canterlot for analysis. We have also managed to recover numerous plasma weapons that were used by the Hellhounds of Splendid valley in their fight against the Alicorns.\nWe may never know the full extent of what Maripony held, but the pieces that were left behind could still be of some use to us, as studying the nature of the IMP traces could help us further understand the biology of the former unity alicorns."

The stable was designed to never open its residence to the wider wasteland until the escape of Velvet Remedy had changed that, and now large swaths of the stable’s population now live among the wastes, mostly within the NCR. Now that the stable is within our administration we’re now able to extract anything useful to us. The crew that was sent were welcomed by the dwellers who remained in the stable, and the crew had brought along former dwellers who left as ambassadors that will help the integration of Stable 2 and its remaining population. We were given some amounts of the Stable’s technology as removing all of its value would render it non-functional, which would not be great for the residence there. Still, we got what we could, and our ambassadors promise that the remaining dwellers of Stable 2 will be proud citizens of the NCR."

 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.6.d:0 "Stable 101 was built in the heart of the Everfree forest under the ruins of the Castle of the Two Sisters, the first Capital of Equestria and the original homeplace of the Elements of harmony. Now it’s known as The Cathedral, the heart of RedEye’s empire of slavery, and now The Cathedral lies in ruin after RedEye’s dream of godhood and a new unity had demised. Digging through the ruins had been a challenge as there were still pockets of slavers but they were neutralized and the slaves freed. Going through Stable 101 itself had revealed large quantities of cybernetic and medical technologies and research that were perhaps brought in the stable before the war as an experiment, like how most stables in the wasteland were used for experiments. Exploring the ruins of The Cathedral and the stable below had revealed the twisted plans RedEye had for the wasteland in his horrendous vision of reuniting Equestria in his image.\nWhen everything valuable was gathered it was decided that the stable will be used for residency and that The Cathedral was to be repurposed back to the Castle of the Two Sisters and used as a museum for Equestrian history from the beginning to today."

 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.7.d:0 "Stable-tec HQ was the key base of operations of the Stable-tec corporation that have built hundreds of stables across the wasteland that have saved countless lives during the Great War. It was also home of the Fillydelphia contingent of the Steel Rangers, our soldiers fought viciously against the more technologically advanced rangers but our numbers had beat them out to secure the HQ.\nMuch of the building’s lower floors were ruined during the battle and the Maneframes were destroyed by the rangers before we could secure it, so little data was recovered when we scavenged the place. What we did manage to get a lot of was Steel Ranger weaponry and Power Armor as well as Stable-tec Technology such as a stash of Pipbucks.\nIt’s unknown what secrets were lost in the destroyed Maneframes but some of what we have gathered was details on other stables and that the majority of them had been used for experiments most of which sounded nefarious and likely did not end well. The silver lining was that we managed to get the location of all these stables which were marked for future exploration. The Maneframs were perhaps the only places of Stable-tec’s darkest secrets, but the one way to find out is through the many stables that they have built."

In recent years the depot has come under the occupation of a group of organized criminals known as the Triggercolts, who have terrorized areas nearby the depot for many years. A detachment of NCR soldiers was sent to clear out the depot of this unruly gang and within a few days the gang had surrendered the base to us and the survivors of this gang were arrested.\n\nThe depot is in a special state of disarray given the recent battle and the activity of its recent residence so not much of the depots contents was recovered, but we managed to recover decent amounts of pre-war weaponry and equipment as well as large quantities of various robots in a separate room. It was given that the gang did not touch this area much given their lack of knowledge of robotics, the robots were transferred and are now mostly within the custody of the NCR military. The depot will eventually be retrofitted back to its purpose as a weapons storage facility as well as setting up an arms workshop to produce and repair more weaponry."

 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.10.d:0 "Stable 29 was one of the many stables marked for being stripped of any useful technology and other useful materials. When the troop detachment was sent to secure the stable they were met with a massive robotic security presence and had to call in much support to clear out the security and secure the stable. The pony inhabitants had been long dead as several skeletons were discovered in various states of decay throughout the isolated corners of the stable. Examining the Maneframe revealed that one of the critical components for water filtration was broken and that the AI that had run the stable deduced that reducing the population would save the water supply and by extent the stable and eventually the entire population of the stable was killed off by the AI. We haven’t recovered much in the ways of weaponry but much of the stable’s pre-war technology was left relatively intact so we have managed to acquire large amounts of pre-war tech to help improve our country.\n\nThe fate of those who lived here must have been a bad one, but there aren't many around to care."
