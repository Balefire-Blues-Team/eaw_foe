  SHA_opening_focus3_desc:0 "После периода междоусобиц рейдеры воссоединились и начали расширяться в сторону Азурвэя. За это время Мистер Топаз восстановил своё влияние над бандой с помощью её нового лидера - Дэдайса."
  
  SHA_opening_focus4:0 "Когти Гауды"
  SHA_opening_focus4_desc:0 "Разбитое Копыто начало полагаться на банду наёмников, известных как Когти Гауды. Грифоны помогали контролировать и управлять обширной территорией рейдеров. Хотя мы сомневаемся в их лояльности, они точно верны своему контракту."
  
  SHA_fortify_shattered_hoof:0 "Укрепить Разбитое Копыто"
  SHA_fortify_shattered_hoof_desc:0 "У Мистера Топаза большие планы относительно нашего будущего. К сожалению, сейчас мы находимся не в том положении, чтобы воплотить эти планы в реальность.

  SHA_expel_the_untrustworthy_desc:0 "Некоторые бандиты сбежали в горы после захвата власти Гаудой, но многие остались и стали служить ей.

Они постоянно затевают драки со всеми подряд, не спешат подчиняться приказам, а также мы предотвратили уже четыре попытки покушения на Гауду. Мы должны избавиться от этих рейдеров."
  
  SHA_reclaim_corona:0 "Вернуть Корону"
  SHA_reclaim_corona_desc:0 "Теперь, когда ситуация стабилизировалась, мы можем сосредоточиться на других проблемах. К примеру, на Рейдерах Лесли, которые воспользовались кризисом, чтобы захватить наши земли и перебить наших пони. Сейчас самое время отомстить им."

  SHA_loot_weapons_from_the_attack_desc:0 "Во время битвы погибло много пони и грифонов. Мы пока пытаемся убрать руины и мусор, а большая часть оружия просто свалена в углу. Стоит присмотреться повнимательнее и отобрать всё ещё пригодные стволы."

  SHA_offer_leslie_to_join_desc:0 "Банда Разбитого Копыта за эти годы заключила множество сделок с самыми разными рейдерами. Это позволило нам стать самой крупной бандой на юге. Поэтому мы предложим Рейдерам Лесли мирно присоединиться к нам. Это то предложение, от которого нельзя отказаться."
  
  SHA_conquer_leslie_raiders:0 "Покорить Рейдеров Лесли"
  SHA_conquer_leslie_raiders_desc:0 "Мы - самая крупная банда на юге. Как кучка бывших рабов посмела украсть нашу землю и думать, что им это сойдет с копыт? Мы должны показать им, что они сделали поистине страшную ошибку."

  SHA_repair_damaged_buildings:0 "Починить инфраструктуру"
  SHA_repair_damaged_buildings_desc:0 "Битва за Разбитое Копыто была жестокой, и она нанесла довольно большой побочный урон. И до сих пор мы, к сожалению, не могли предпринять каких-либо серьёзных действий для устранения повреждений. Однако теперь, когда наша экономика пришла в порядок, мы можем сосредоточиться на ремонте и восстановлении."
  
  SHA_hunt_down_remnants:0 "Выследить работорговцев"

 NCR_expand_rock_breaking_desc:0 "Rockbreaking, while not well understood, is a great source of mineral wealth. By helping the Rock Farmers to expand their operations, we not only improve their industry but also unlock more of the mineral wealth in their lands."
 
 NCR_lumber_from_radshore:0 "Lumber From the Radshore"
 NCR_lumber_from_radshore_desc:0 "Greenline used to be a major producer and exporter of quality lumber before the bombs fell. Unfortunately, the last two centuries haven't been the kindest to Equestria's lumber industry, and as a result the locals have largely left the lumberyards abandoned. If we could convince some business-minded ponies to restore this industry with our investments, the resultant lumber would in turn allow us to fuel our own industry back home. Everybody wins!"
 
 NCR_integrated_economies:0 "Integrated Economies"
 NCR_integrated_economies_desc:0 "Our efforts have paid off! With our economies becoming more and more intertwined, every member of the alliance is free to specialize much more and focus on what they are good at, while letting others pick up the slack. In the end, we are all better off."
 
 NCR_shore_up_east:0 "Shore Up the East"

 NCR_arm_the_fishers:0 "Arm the Fishers"
 NCR_arm_the_fishers_desc:0 "The Rad Fishers don't have much of a military and frankly, they can't afford much of one. Still, we can train what few recruits they can muster into the most effective fighting force they possibly can be."
 
 NCR_prov_army_of_the_republic:0 "Establish a Provisional Army"
 NCR_prov_army_of_the_republic_desc:0 "Our fledgeling republic will need to be defended, and we can't completely rely on Gawdyna's Talons to do all the work. To this end, we shall establish our own standing army of citizen-soldiers."
 
 NCR_seize_civillian_arms:0 "Seize Civillian Arms"
 NCR_seize_civillian_arms_desc:0 "While it is the intention of the republic to allow every citizen to defend themselves and their home, at this critical moment we need every gun we can get a hold of! This won't be popular, but we can give them back later..."

 NCR_everycreature_serves:0 "Everycreature Serves!"

 NCR_everything_we_have:0 "Everything We Have"
 NCR_everything_we_have_desc:0 "If we do not make every possible gun, build every possible factory, and conscript every possible soldier, how can we expect our republic to survive the war to come?

 NCR_the_war_to_free_the_sun:0 "To Free the Sun"
 NCR_the_war_to_free_the_sun_desc:0 "For over two centuries now, the sight of the sun has been a rarity thanks to the pegasi's cloud layer. In order to return the sun to the Wasteland, pegasi blood will have to be shed. However, we must ask: is the cost of war with such an advanced enemy worth a bit of sunlight?"

 NCR_the_citizenship_act:0 "The Citizenship Act"
 NCR_the_citizenship_act_desc:0 "The Senate has received a proposal that would enable any sentient creature that lives within our borders to lawfully aquire citizenship of the NCR.

 NCR_curtail_the_generals:0 "Curtail the Generals"
 NCR_curtail_the_generals_desc:0 "Our general staff has gained quite a large amount of political power, but is has also become bloated and inefficient, in no small part due to the integration of our former allies militaries.

 NCR_the_enclave_act:0 "Meet With Enclave Leaders"
 NCR_the_enclave_act_desc:0 "Ever since our victory over New Cloudsdale, we have had quite a lot of trouble trying to keep the pegasi under our control. Their ability to fly has forced us to rely on griffons to keep them in line, and this has proven to be unsustainable.

 NCR_proposal_216:0 "Proposal 261"
 NCR_proposal_216_desc:0 "New Canterlot has grown to be a fine city indeed, but it is unfortunately lacking in many regards.

 NCR_found_fmcc:0 "Found the FMDS"

As a solution to this problem, we shall provide funding and backing to private companies that can secure these resources much more efficiently than we ever could."
 
 NCR_expand_academia:0 "Establish Public Education"
 NCR_expand_academia_desc:0 "The closest thing to a proper education system in our nation is a few local schoolhouses here and there. This is absolutely unacceptable.

The next generation shall be an educated one!"
 
 NCR_emergency_food_stamps:0 "Emergency Food Relief Program"
 NCR_emergency_food_stamps_desc:0 "As countless pegasi flee into our lands, we are met with a crisis that we were nowhere near prepared to deal with. Already, these refugees have begun to gather into their own camps and slums, where they are left to starve in filthy makeshift shacks and tiny hovels.

 NCR_fillydelphia_panis_proposal:0 "The Fillydelphia-Panis Proposal"
 NCR_fillydelphia_panis_proposal_desc:0 "The Manehatten Steel Ranger's have proven themselves to be agreeable thus far. We shall offer them the land that once belonged to the much less cooperative Fillydelphia Steel Rangers, in exchange for them allowing us to fully unify Manehatten under our rule. Hopefully they'll take our deal, as we're not sure what to do with the land ourselves."

 NCR_how_to_deal_with_the_followers_desc:0 "These 'Followers of the Apocalypse' have rapidly established themselves across the Wasteland, and more importantly across our territory, as a peaceful ponytarian group. Their goal seems noble, but they firmly hold pacifistic ideals that often contradict our own action. With them rapidly on the way to becoming their own political force within our country, we must decide what stance to take on them."
 
 NCR_operation_broken_heart:0 "Operation 'Broken Heart'"
 NCR_operation_broken_heart_desc:0 "These soft-hearted foals can't be trusted, regardless of any sort of good intention they may claim to possess.

 NCR_commitee_of_expansion:0 "Committee on the Expansion of the Republic"
 NCR_commitee_of_expansion_desc:0 "Our expansion is not a matter of if, but rather when.

 NCR_reclaim_cloudsdale:0 "The Ruins of Cloudsdale"
 NCR_reclaim_cloudsdale_desc:0 "Cloudsdale, the largest pegasus city in Equestrian history, is now within our grasp. While it was hit directly by multiple megaspells and fell from the skies during the war, there is still a cornocopia of resources left to salvage from its ruins. The only thing that is standing in our way is the 'nation' calling themselves the Lightning Scavengers. We expect that they'll offer little real resistance against us."

 NCR_deal_with_the_guilds:0 "Deal With the Guilds"

 NCR_topple_mareway_desc:0 "Mareway, one of the most prosperous cities on the east coast, is ruled by a bunch of so called nobles who think they have a right to rule simply due to their bloodlines. Its time we do this in the Prench style and put an end to the noble scum!"

 NCR_trek_through_the_bogs_desc:0 "To get to Canterlot proper, we will have to go through the Froggy Bottom Bogs and the Everfree Forest, some of the worst possible terrain we could ever try to march through. But if that is what it takes, then so be it..."

 NCR_take_ponisnsula_desc:0 "After our grand victory over Fillydelphia, we are left as one of if not the strongest nation within all of Equestria.

 NCR_reach_out_steel_rangers_desc:0 "The Fillydelphia Chapter of Steel Rangers were very effective fighters, managing to be a thorn in even Red Eye's side for years. This was in large part thanks to their power armor, which made their soldiers into walking tanks and allowed them to lay down heavy firepower against any who engaged them.

 NCR_end_the_speedcult:0 "End the Speedcult"
 NCR_end_the_speedcult_desc:0 "One of the largest problem's we're having in dealing with the local raiders is their large supply of highspeed vehicles. This has allowed them to literally run circles around our soldiers and evade our efforts to deal with them thus far.

 NCR_copy_zebra_tanks_desc:0 "While Equestria had many advantages over the zebras, one thing it was lacking was proper tanks.

 NCR_naval_com_equipment_desc:0 "It's important that our ships may communicate with eachother over a substantial distance, preferably without any hostile ships knowing what they're saying. To this end, we shall work on developing naval communications technology."

 NCR_azuria_river_patrol:0 "Azuria River Patrol"
 NCR_azuria_river_patrol_desc:0 "A large floating fortress is great and all, but it is of limited effectiveness in our narrow riverways. We need small and quick ships to patrol these rivers instead, ensuring that they are safe for our civilian traders."

 NCR_expand_stablepony_knowledge_desc:0 "A great many facilities built during the War are still standing today.

 NCR_proper_research_centre:0 "A Proper Research Centre"
 NCR_proper_research_centre_desc:0 "In order to ensure our research remains on par with the more advanced factions of the Wasteland, we will need specialized equipment, dedicated research centres and most of all more scientists.

 NCR_breach_neighvarro:0 "Breach Neighvarro"
 NCR_breach_neighvarro_desc:0 "Our scientists believe that they have come up with a method of breaching the inner shield of Neighvarro. By utilizing one of the recovered raptor reactors for power on one end, and the Neighvarro reactor at the other, they believe that they could counter the multi-phased shield for just long enough for a team to teleport in, and deactivate it from the inside."
 
 NCR_neighvarro_blueprints:0 "Salvage Enclave Blueprints"
 NCR_neighvarro_blueprints_desc:0 "The Enclave holds some of the most advanced technology to exist past the War. By learning from their work, we can turn our own forces into the most advanced and effective in the Wasteland!"

 NCR_labour_hayseed_tribals:0 "Put the Hayseed Tribes to Work"
 NCR_labour_hayseed_tribals_desc:0 "The Hayseed Swamp is difficult to work on, due in no small part to it being, well, a swamp. Fortunately for us, we happen to have citizens who have lived in the swamp for their whole life and know it very well. If anyone can find the most stable ground to build on, it would be the tribals that have lived there their whole lives. "
 
 NCR_modern_poldering_techniques:0 "Develop Poldering Techniques"
 NCR_modern_poldering_techniques_desc:0 "We can't rightly build on land that's sinking into the water. However, if we remove the water entirely then that will no longer be an issue. As such, it would be wise to begin investing in the development of techniques to reclaim the land from the swamp."
 
 NCR_neocastle_industrial_plan:0 "The Neocastle Industrial Plan"
 NCR_neocastle_industrial_plan_desc:0 "Neocastle has always been more industrialized and prosperous than much of the Wasteland. Expanding upon it's already large industrial base will be a relatively simple matter, with the largest difficulty just being to find workers for the new factories."
 
 NCR_establish_nccdf:0 "Establish the NCCDF"
 NCR_establish_nccdf_desc:0 "The New Canterlot Cooperative Development Fund will be a large amount of funds allocated towards the purpose of developing, expanding, and maintaining our capital city.

 NCR_gem_farms_thing:0 "The Rock Valley Gem Rush"
 NCR_gem_farms_thing_desc:0 "Rock Valley was once full of valuable gems that were crucial to Equestria's economy. It turns out that is still the case. A great deal of gems have been found just lying right under the surface, and this has triggered a full on rush to get there. Every creature and their mother hopes to hit it big and become rich off of the valuable commodity."
 
 NCR_repair_cloudsdale:0 "Subsidise Cloudsdale"
 NCR_repair_cloudsdale_desc:0 "Though Cloudsdale has been successfully restablished, it is unfortunately not anywhere near as prosperous as we would of hoped. To help deal with this, we will be investing in a substantial expansion of their industrial district. Hopefully this will go a long way towards restoring them to the major city they once were."
 
 NCR_wonderbolts_manufacturing:0 "Revive Wonderbolts Manufacturing"
 NCR_wonderbolts_manufacturing_desc:0 "Wonderbolt's Manufacturing was a prewar and later wartime cloudship development and manufacturing company. Surprisingly, their Cloudsdale headquarters was left largely intact by it's plummet from the sky. It wouldn't be too much work to make it operational once more, and to restore their company as our nationalized manufacturer of all cloudships and cloudship accessories."
 
 NCR_mine_gorges:0 "Mine the Ghastly Gorges"
 NCR_mine_gorges_desc:0 "The Ghastly Gorges are extremely dangerous, but they're also home to quite a large amount of natural resources. Any attempt to tap into these resources will be costly and full of risk, but the potential payoffs are more than enough to justify it."
 
 NCR_pincer_sunrise:0 "Pincer the Sunrise-Region"
 NCR_pincer_sunrise_desc:0 "Though the nations that separate us from Manehatten stand little chance against our military, we would still rather avoid any unnecessary casualties. To this end, a plan has been hatched to bring another nation into the fold. The ponies of Tenpony have become known far and wide for their civilized behavior, making them ideal allies within Manehatten itself. With their help, we could march towards the city with as few casualties as possible."

 NCR_trans_azuria_railway_desc:0 "To better cement our capital as a center of commerce across the Republic, we shall develop a series of railways all across the Azuria region with our capital being the central hub for all of them.

 NCR_leslie_arms_industry:0 "Leslie Arms Industry"
 NCR_leslie_arms_industry_desc:0 "The former serfs who founded Leslie were in great need of weapons, especially after they turned to raiding for a living.

We can take these old workshops and substantially expand them until they have become major weapons factories."
 
 NCR_gunpowder_belt:0 "The Gunpowder Belt"
 NCR_gunpowder_belt_desc:0 "There is a stretch of land that spans from southern Neocastle into Leslie where a large amount of arms manufacturing is located. This area has become known as 'The Gunpowder Belt', and it has become renown for its efficiency and productivity when it comes to firearm production. We would only benefit from promoting this and developing it more."
 
 NCR_republic_breadbasket:0 "Retool Machines for Agriculture"
 NCR_republic_breadbasket_desc:0 "While our industry is important, agriculture is still the most important backbone of our nation. We'd never be able to feed our people nor our army without the many farmsteads dotting our land. However, we believe we could apply industrial techniques to these farms in order to substantially improve their total food output."
 
 NCR_land_reclamation_initiative:0 "Land Reclamation Initiatives"
 NCR_land_reclamation_initiative_desc:0 "Two centuries without civilized government has left much of the Wasteland wild and overgrown. Quite a lot of land that could otherwise be used to build factories or homesteads on is instead taken up by foliage and hostile wildlife. In order to ensure that we can utilize our territory to it's fullest, we shall launch an effort to clear away these inconveniences."
 
 NCR_everfree_ressources:0 "Exploiting the Everfree"
 NCR_everfree_ressources_desc:0 "Now that the Everfree has been secured, we can set about extracting its many untapped resources. While we're at it, we can also use much of it's now empty land to build a new power plant, which shall supply electricity to all of the states surrounding it."
 
 NCR_buerau_of_settlement:0 "The Ministry of Settlement"
 NCR_buerau_of_settlement_desc:0 "Thus far, the Department of Interior has been responsible for handling all settlement initiatives. This has left them very overworked and undermanned, especially with their large amount of other duties. To help decrease their workload, we shall be seperating out all duties related to the settlement of new land and the management of settlers to the newly formed Ministry of Settlement. It will still fall under the DoI's oversight, but hopefully it will make their job a bit easier."
 
 NCR_tear_down_old_build_new:0 "Destroy Red Eye's Legacy"
 NCR_tear_down_old_build_new_desc:0 "Red Eye was a brutal tyrant who relied on slavery and force to keep his empire running. His greatest accomplishment was turning Fillydelphia into an industrial powerhouse, comparable to its state during the War. However, the tyrant is dead and we have found ourselves with his city. As a sign of our good faith towards those who once lived in chains under his brutal rule, we shall see to dismantling his weapons factories and putting his resources towards helping the common citizen."
 
 NCR_build_on_redeye:0 "Build on Red Eye's Accomplishments"
 NCR_build_on_redeye_desc:0 "Red Eye's greatest achievement was turning Fillydelphia into an industrial powerhouse. It just so happens that we could always use another industrial centre to help supply our nation and, more importantly, our army. We also conveniently have a large supply of labourers who are used to working in those very factories. Sure, they might want to go back to the workplaces where they were once forced to slave away in, but they won't have much of a choice if there's no job prospects elsewhere. §RThey shall work or they shall starve. The choice is theirs.§!"
 
 NCR_comission_to_exploit_foal_mountains:0 "Exploit the Foal Mountains"
 NCR_comission_to_exploit_foal_mountains_desc:0 "The Foal Mountains are home to a great deal of useful natural resources.

 NCR_extend_comission_control:0 "Extend the Treaty on Wasteland Exploitation"
 NCR_extend_comission_control_desc:0 "The Treaty on Wasteland Exploitation has allowed the honest private companies of the Republic to pursue their interests freely, with funding and support from us. However, several of the larger companies we're supporting have recently begun lobbying us with requests to extend their legal immunity and provide them even more funding for their operations. They argue that such frivilous things as 'worker safety laws' are getting in the way of their success, and that if we were to remove these artificial restrictions, they would begin to prosper. Though we were a bit hesitant at first, their wallets provided a very compelling argument."
 
 NCR_finish_new_canterlot:0 "New Canterlot, Finished!"
 NCR_finish_new_canterlot_desc:0 "Our efforts to expand New Canterlot have been a resounding success. The city now sits as one of the grandest in the Wasteland, overshadowing even the likes of Fillydelphia and Manehatten. Indeed, many of our better-off citizens are even able to enjoy living standards not far off from those enjoyed by Equestria's citizens before the war."
 
 NCR_new_east_sea_fleet:0 "Build the Celestial Fleet"
 NCR_new_east_sea_fleet_desc:0 "The Celestial Fleet shall be the grandest naval force to exist since the War itself.

 NCR_4_cities_proposal:0 "The Four Great Cities"
 NCR_4_cities_proposal_desc:0 "The four greatest cities within our Republic are New Canterlot, Old Canterlot, Fillydelphia, and Manehatten. These four are all independantly prosperous enough to be the envy of the Wasteland, but together their full potential is realized. Free trade and cooperation between them all allows one to make up where the others fail, for each of them to supply those resources vitally needed by the others, and for our economy to prosper like never before. They are truly the greatest cities of the greatest Republic this world has ever known."
 
 GFX_goal_NCR_university:0 "University of New Canterlot"
 GFX_goal_NCR_university_desc:0 "To further expand our science base, we shall invest in the creation of a grand university within our capitol.

 NCR_spirit_of_mwt_desc:0 "The Ministry of Wartime Technology was responsible for all military innovations and advancements during the Great War.

 NCR_spirit_of_mas:0 "Continue the MAS's Work"
 NCR_spirit_of_mas_desc:0 "The Ministry of Arcane Sciences was responsible for all arcane innovations and advancements during the Great War.

 NCR_restore_fillydelphia_hub:0 "Restore the Fillydelphia Hub"
 NCR_restore_fillydelphia_hub_desc:0 "The Fillydelphia Hub of the Ministry of Wartime Technology was where much of their technology was developed. Red Eye was even so kind as to keep the place in a decent condition for us, so it shouldn't take much work to make it fully operational."
 
 NCR_rebuild_canterlot_hub:0 "Rebuild the Canterlot Hub"
 NCR_rebuild_canterlot_hub_desc:0 "Ministry Walk was home to the top hubs of all six Ministries. The most important of these being the Ministry of Arcane Sciences Hub, which was not just the place from which their entire Ministry was run, but was also responsible for overseeing a great deal of different research projects. The pink cloud kept the building largely preserved over the centuries, so restoring it should be fairly easy."
 
 NCR_old_world_wonders:0 "Old World Wonders"
 NCR_old_world_wonders_desc:0 "There were many truly impressive works done by wartime Equestria. From the worlds largest bridges to massive power plants, there were so many different feats done that it's hard to count them all. Putting resources towards restoring some of these would do nothing but benefit us."
 
 NCR_equestrias_deepest_secrets:0 "Equestria's Deepest Secrets"
 NCR_equestrias_deepest_secrets_desc:0 "Not everything Equestria did was above the table. Many of the Ministries were involved in things that were far removed from the concepts of nature and ethics. We would never seek to delve into anything that is blatantly evil, but surely dipping our toes into some more questionable fields wouldn't hurt."
 
 NCR_new_canterlot_plan_phase_2:0 "New Canterlot Plan Phase 2"
 NCR_new_canterlot_plan_phase_2_desc:0 "Though our capital has come far, it can always go even further.

 NCR_work_with_tenpony_desc:0 "Tenpony Tower has been a good ally to us, so now it's time we treat them in kind. We will let them keep their city, and shall invest in their prosperity as a sign of good will towards them. Of course, they can't expect to stay independent from the Republic forever. They'll end up as a state, whether they like it or not."
 
 NCR_ten_military_cooperation:0 "Military Cooperation With Manehattan"
 NCR_ten_military_cooperation_desc:0 "Manehatten's military is disorderly, inexperienced, and of questionable loyalty. We shall help fix the first two problems, while using the third towards our own ends."

Gawdyna Grimfeather, in a speech to her following, along with many notable settlement and factions leaders from across Azuria's territory, has declared the establishment of the New Canterlot Republic. It will serve as a true successor to the Princessdom of Equestria that had perished in the Great War over 200 years ago.\nThe declaration came after Shattered Hoof, or the Provisional Republic of Azuria, had managed to emerge as the great unifier of the Azuria region. Many lands surrounding Shattered Hoof have come together under the leadership of Gawdyna in an alliance to fend off their foes, and they had recently agreed to become united under the banner of the Republic. It had become evident in the end that a new power would emerge in Azuria, one that would shape Equus's history for many years to come.\nFollowing the declaration, Gawdyna proposed a constitution, a document that lays out the rights of the creatures who reside in the NCR, followed by laws that would shape the structure of the government and how law and order should be applied in the Wasteland. The most prominent of these rights included freedom of speech, freedom of press, and freedom of religion. These crucial rights would guarantee the personal liberties of all creatures within the Republic, giving them protection from any sort of tyrannical rule and ensuring that all would be free to live their own lives and make their own decisions without government intervention. Another key right of the constitution was the ability for the citizens to vote for their leaders, from local mayors all the way to the president themselves. These rights and many more gave the common individual more freedom in their lands than they have ever experienced in the history of Equestria as a whole. The common citizen shall have more say in their government and country, and the faults of the Diarchy would never happen again.\nThe flag of the NCR was decided to be a horizontal tri-color design with a symbol of Celestia's sun in the middle with Luna's moon in the middle of that. The symbol was a tribute to the efforts of the Diarchy of protecting Equestria and its prosperity for so long, even if that same diarchy is what brought the world to ruin. The tri-color was purple, white, and blue, with the shade of light purple dedicated to the republic, white for the promise of restoring the lands of the wasteland to what it once was, and blue for the Azureway, the lifeblood of the NCR's trade and economy. The new flag was hoisted high above New Canterlot, the new name for Junctiontown created by Gawdyna herself.\nNews of the creation of the NCR and its ideas and promises spread quickly across the Wasteland, and soon after thousands of ponies and other creatures were packing their bags and heading from every corner of the Wasteland to the NCR, hoping of making a new and grand life for themselves and their loved ones. The future is uncertain for the young Republic, but in time it will be known that the birth of the New Canterlot Republic will mark the beginning of a new chapter in Equestrian history."

Many across the Republic thought that the election was a sham and utterly pointless, as there was only one candidate on the ballots. Despite this, the election went off without a hitch as ballots were set up at communities across the NCR and votes rolled in. To no one's surprise, Gawdyna and her newly formed United Republican Party secured an overwhelming majority of the votes, with the only opposition being a few minor write-ins.\n"As I stand here, a figurehead in not just a bold new nation, but a figurehead of Equestrian history that will be remembered for centuries, I feel obliged to tell you all that I will do everything in my power and the power of all who watch before me and those hearing from radios across the country, to reach the true potential of this new nation and to bring forth a new era in Equestrian history. One that is not plagued with the struggles of the Wasteland, but is instead a land defined by the values of friendship, harmony, and prosperity."\n That was just a small portion of an inauguration speech given by Gawdyna shortly after the election.

However, he has also come out in full support of sending aid to freedom fighters around the world, and working to help any who wish to escape tyranny to do so by fleeing to our lands. On top of these, he has also put a very strong focus on establishing a public education system and working towards improving the living standards of the average citizen. \n\n He has already become wildly popular among our citizenry, and has also managed to garner considerable support from within the military thanks to their respect for him.

What the PL seeks to achieve is immense growth of the military industrial complex coupled with an overhaul and expansion of the NCR military, and using it to seize territories across the wasteland by force. Their emphasis of using extreme military force has gained them very little support from those outside of extreme militants and ex-Enclave.\n\nIt would take a crisis from within and without for the Patriotic League to gain the support of enough of the populace to actually take control of the government and achieve what Steel Wall wishes.

There was no time for somepony else to contest Gawdyna's candidacy, nor was there any dedication of her wanting to hold a fair and open election, just empty promises, it seemed that she was more concerned getting it over with and taking the reigns as quickly as possible with no concern that there are those that are not supportive of her leadership. Her history as a mercenary for a ruthless slaver is proof that her causes were more in line with her personal quest for glory and power and not the betterment of the wasteland's people, thus her presidency is greatly immoral and illegitimate...\n\n...The absurdity that a griffon now rules over our nation, a pony majority country, greatly undermines the true representations of the NCR and is a direct threat to the largest demographic of our nation. It is vital that this griffon resigns from her post and allows for better representation to take form in our country and for true leaders to take the reigns, not some petty gun for hire with ambitions for power and wealth. If this mercenary ever dares to run for her next term; then I will take those who agree with what I have told you, and split from this illegitimate party to undermine the questionable aims of this griffon."\n\nThese were some of the most important notions from an hour long declaration from the Secretary of Treasury that Gawdyna's Presidency is illegitimate, and that if she runs for the next election Waterworks will split the party and create a splinter faction within the URP known as the Free Ponies Party. What followed after the speech was cries of various support, some called Waterworks a traitor among other slurs, while some praised his words, crying that Gawdyna is a traitor to the NCR's ideals and she should resign. Things grew chaotic with Military Police sent to settle things down. It's unclear what may follow from this drastic turn of events, but what is clear is that the foundations of Gawdyna's Presidency and her party might be starting to crumble."

No weapon has been able to penetrate it and no spell has been able to bypass it, with even our brightest minds unable to figure out how to get past the shield. Until now. \n \n The team dedicated to finding a way through this most durable arcane fortress has devised a plan that they believe would allow a small team to slip in. Their plan revolves around taking a bypass spell, which has thus far proven insufficient in breaching the shield, and turning it into a megaspell. This, they believe, will be enough to allow a small team to be teleported into the facility. \n \n As the sun rises, their plan is put into motion. A team of highly talented unicorns, some of the best within all of the NCR, get into position, while another team checks the massive spell matrix drawn around the shield for any errors. As the all clear is given, the unicorns begin casting what may very well be one of the most complex spells to be created since the War. All of Neighvarro lights up, as they draw more and more power from two immense magical reactors: one from the base itself, and another scavenged from one of the Enclave's mighty Raptor-Class cloudships. The light grows brighter, as their spell enters the final steps of casting, and the expedition team prepares themselves for what lies ahead. Finally, with one great release of energy, the megaspell is cast... "

Looking around, they can't help but to appreciate the complexity of the facility they find themselves trapped in. Cutting edge technology, impressive even by Wartime standards, lines the walls. Unfortunately for the team, no obvious method of turning off the shield outside presents itself. \n \n As they continue exploring the facility, they run into another problem: much of the facility is locked off, and the door controls appear unresponsive. Despite being trapped within the control room itself, they lack any real method to take control of the facility. Without a way out, and with their radios failing the moment they appeared inside, they had no way to contact the team outside. And as such, they had no way to be extracted from what could very well become their tomb. \n \n As this realization dawns on the team, several of their members begin to break down. Panic closes in, and their expedition becomes rapidly disorderly. Escape seems impossible, their mission seems to be a failure, and their sacrifice will have been in vain. That is, until a monitor flickers to life before them."

 shatteredhoof_ncr.1812.d:0 "'Hello, my little ponies.' \n \n A figure appears on the monitor, one resembling a pony resigned to the history books. A digital mane flows in a simulated wind, and the graceful form of the long-dead Princess Celestia takes up the screen. The reactions of those among the expedition vary from baffled to curious, though the lingering fear of their horrible demise continues to eat away at their psyche. \n \n 'May I know who leads your team?', the image before them asked. To which, the leader of the expedition stepped forward and spoke: 'I am the leader of this team. Are you the computer running this facility?' \n \n The image of a ghost before them chuckled for a moment, before responding. 'No, I am no computer. Though I am the one in control of this facility, yes. Might I ask your name?' \n \n The expedition leader hesitates for a moment, before responding. 'I am New Rock. And who are you?' \n \n 'I, my dear little pony, am Celestia. And I owe you an apology for your time here. I'm afraid I haven't been the most accommodating host.' \n \n At this, the team began to chatter among themselves, before New Rock spoke up again. 'Celestia is dead. Whether you're an imposter or a loony AI, I don't quite care. What I do care about is getting my team out of this glorified casket.' \n \n At this, the image before them flashed with a look of sadness, before replying. 'It was never my intention to hold you here. If you wish to go, you will find that the way is now open for you. Be warned though, I'm afraid I can't let you or your team back in once you've left.' \n \n As she says this, one of the doors leading out of the control room opens. New Rock is quick to restore discipline within her team, and leads them out of it. More doors open to them, as they make their way towards the edge of the facility, before finally being faced with the damned bubble that had trapped them here to begin with. The bubble flickers and falls, and they step over its boundaries. The resulting cheers from the science team are brought to an abrupt end, as the shield reappears."

Removing the door was not an effortless matter, as it took our teams several weeks and over a dozen different attempts to finally find a way to get through it: bypassing it entirely by mining under it. Our next obstacle was the remnants of the stable, who put up one hell of a resistence against us. Every hallway was a chokepoint, and every room had a trap or ambush. Being sent into the depths of this forsaken place is a fate that many will have nightmares about for the rest of their lives.

Some of them were heavily armed, putting much strain on our military to quell them before they get any ideas of an insurrection. The most troubling issue however is that we now have the sudden problem of feeding countless new mouths.\n\nMany of our farms were already strained by an influx of hundreds of pegasus refugees in the aftermath of the war on the Enclave but now farms all over the NCR are being sacked to feed the wave of thousands of new pegasi descending into our country. This has put a great strain on our economy, especially our agricultural sector, which is ill equipped to handle such an influx of new residents. This has resulted in a large spike in food prices across the NCR, leading to reports of mass starvation of our own citizens. We can only do so much to handle this, and we have enough problems on our table as it is, but if it's not handled soon enough this could lead to an even bigger famine crisis."

As a result, we have very little regard for them or any claim they may have to be the Equestrian government. \n\n There also exists a small issue in the form of their power armour and heavy weaponry.

A number of solutions have been offered to deal with this problem.\n\n Firstly, we could always see about contacting the Manehatten Steel Rangers, assuming they're still around and willing to work with us. They could be encouraged to move all of their operations to the Fillydelphia Chapter's former territory, essentially continuing their mission.\n\n Secondly, we could see about approaching the remnants of the old chapter there, and helping them restablish themselves as a new chapter. Of course, they would be required to pledge loyalty to our Republic, and their autonomy would be limited. Sure, they might not be the friendliest towards us, but this would at least deal with the problem of holding that territory.\n\n Finally, we could just keep the land as is.

They want us to move all of our operations over to southern Fillydelphia, where we may work on continuing our fallen chapters work.

The NCR has been very accepting of these foreign volunteers and has done much to spread word across the entire wasteland about the war to vanquish the great evil that lords over Fillydelphia and much of the Heartland, but with the war still in its infancy, it's hard to tell if all this aid will be enough.\nFor the sake of the NCR, and perhaps the entire wasteland, we need to stand against RedEye, stand against the Darkness..."

We are of course very hesitant to give up any of our potential territory, but refusing this demand will almost certainly result in the peace efforts falling through entirely, along with our alliance."
 shatteredhoof_ncr.1615.a:0 "Give it to them, they've been loyal allies after all."
 shatteredhoof_ncr.1615.b:0 "This is unacceptable! The deal is off."
 
 shatteredhoof_ncr.1616.t:0 "Tenpony Demands Current Borders"
 shatteredhoof_ncr.1616.d:0 "Efforts to control the conference are proving rather futile as the Tenpony representatives across the room frown at any of our proposals. Instead of following any of our suggestions, they wish to keep the current borders decided by the war. They sound quite obstinate, making it quite clear that this is their final offer. We can accept this, or we can storm out of the peace conference and bring our alliance with them to an end."
 shatteredhoof_ncr.1616.a:0 "Fine, whatever."
 shatteredhoof_ncr.1616.b:0 "We shall teach them not to fuck with our Republic."
 
 shatteredhoof_ncr.1617.t:0 "The NCR Cuts Ties"
 shatteredhoof_ncr.1617.d:0 "After suggesting our own goals on acquiring more than just their proposed offer, the conference did not proceed as we'd hoped. The meeting was abruptly concluded with a single motion from an NCR representative, leaving us with a final declaration that they will cut all ties with us. Any further attempts to communicate since the conference are met with silence. Furthermore, we have baleful reports of NCR activity near our borders, only mere days after the meeting."
 shatteredhoof_ncr.1617.a:0 "This may have been a mistake."
 
 shatteredhoof_ncr.1618.t:0 "The NCR Agrees"
 shatteredhoof_ncr.1618.d:0 "With our counter-proposal offered, the NCR took a brief moment to discuss among themselves, before they quieted down and caught our attention once more. One of them glanced at the map of Sunrise with an expression that lacked enthusiasm. \n\n 'Very well, we will agree with keeping the current borders.'"
 shatteredhoof_ncr.1618.a:0 "Well, that's sorted out."
 
 
 
 ###Decision-Events###

 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.1.t:0 "In the Ruins of the Enclave"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.1.d:0 "Neighvarro used to be a wartime airforce-base situated west of New Horseleans that was used by the Enclave as their primary base of operations across the Equestrian Heartlands. It was also vital to the future plans of the Enclave, as Neighvarro is the home of the Single Pegasus Project Hub which, in theory, gives one control over the weather patterns across most of the Equestrian continent. The Enclave used the limited access they had to the SPP to maintain a constant cloud cover over the entire wasteland since the Great War. It was here that they began their conquest of the Wasteland and also the place where they ultimately surrendered. Now the base lies in ruins after the Battle of Neighvarro and the dispersal of the "New Cloudsdale" Enclave across the Wasteland.\nWith Neighvarro under our control we can now freely explore what remains of the base to discover all of its secrets and take advantage of what technology was left behind. An army of hired scavengers, explorers, and scientific minds were dispatched to dig into the base of Neighvarro and especially the SPP facility. After the remnants of Neighvarro's automated security systems and independent Scavengers were dealt with by NCR troops every piece of technology and data that could be gathered was collected and catalogued to be studied and used for the NCR's benefit.\nAmong the best finds were several damaged blueprints for energy-weapons, an entire room full of X02 Power Armour, and a virtual treasure trove of memory orbs the Enclave must have used to train pilots.\nThe most intriguing find however, was made by a team of explorers, who discovered what seemed to be a large room, surrounded by an impervious energy shield, at the heart of the base. Attempts to disable the shield have been unsuccessful as there seems to be no clear way of disabling it without damaging what lies behind the shield. What's even more perplexing is that the shield itself is not connected to the main reactor of the facility which means whatever is powering it lies inside the shield. It's theorized that the heart of the SPP's functions and purpose is what lies inside the shield, but until we find a safe way to penetrate it, whatever secrets lie inside that shield will remain a mystery."
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.1.a:0 "Tell the eggheads I want that shield cracked as soon as possible!"
 
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.2.t:0 "The Secrets of Hill 431"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.2.d:0 "On a hill dubbed 'Hill 431' lies a seemingly ordinary bunker used by the Equestrian military before the Great War, due to its proximity to Canterlot it must have been designed as a part of an extended defense system for the former Equestrian capital. What became of the bunker after the war was that a dispatch of a Talon Company had set up shop inside the bunker and that they had abandoned it a few years prior for reasons unknown. Now that the bunker is under our administration we should clear it and see if the Talons had left behind anything interesting and afterwards use the bunker as a NCR military base.\nExplorers that had been sent there have discovered massive rooms untouched by the Talons filled with wartime weaponry and munitions, from regular infantry uniforms and rifles to power armor and gatling lasers. What came as a surprise was the discovery of a massive reinforced steel door leading to a floor that was not mentioned in the bunker's schematics.\nWhen the door was opened our team had to venture along seemingly endless tunnels filled with robotic security systems and dozens of face doors and traps. But finally, they found the correct entrance.\nThe team was surprised to find a truly gigantic laboratory with pods filled with bodies of every creature from simple ponies and griffons, to changelings and even dragons, all preserved from whatever wartime experiments were conducted here. The lab was filled to the brim with strange equipment and technology used for biomagical and biomechanical work. While the research seems very arcane by today's standards, our scientists hypothesize that this lab was researching a way to transfer the minds of somepony captured within a "souljar" into synthetic bodies. The evidence suggests that this laboratory was run in cooperation by the MAS and the MOI. We are not sure if the experiments ever saw success, as much of the later research data has been expunged, but it is nevertheless an intriguing prospect. Some of the surviving notes also propose introducing a forced magical change within a changeling to make its body assume the form of an alicorn permanently. However, this was designated a failure, as apparently, the "synthetic alicorns" had less magical throughput than those of "Project Unity".\nIt's unknown if this research will ever prove useful to us or why it was developed during the war, but we'll keep digging."
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.2.a:0 "One day the secrets of this bunker will come in handy..."

 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.3.t:0 "A Ministry's Secrets"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.3.d:0 "This stable we have come across is simply extraordinary: it's apparent that these Stableponies truly believed themselves to be the Ministry of Arcane Sciences and had continued the "Ministry" long after the war, remaining isolated from the rest of the world much like the Enclave. And sadly, like the Enclave we had to wage war against the inhabitants of this stable to get to its secrets. After the smoke cleared nearly all of the stable's inhabitants had died either doggidly fighting us to the last, or commiting suicide within their rooms, with their Minister having shot himself in his office. Those few who survived were apprehended and taken in for questioning or given citizenship for the civilian types of the surviving inhabitants.\nWhen exploring the stable itself it appeared that most of the technology and research was destroyed in the fighting or was intentionally destroyed in a scorched earth effort. We have managed to retrieve a small amount of their research files and also decent amounts of advanced weaponry that this stable had developed over the last 200 years, including a schematic for a tank that they appear to have designed themselves post-war. What surprised us was that the stable also had large amounts of wasteland items mostly those used by slavers. It appears that this stable had ventured into the wasteland before and had taken many items back with them to perhaps study the ins and outs of the wasteland, despite much of what they studied to be some of the wasteland's worst.\nA couple of days after we managed to take what's valuable an explosion ripped the stable apart killing most of those left behind to hold the stable and rendering it naught but a smoking ruin. It is assumed that the main reactor of the stable had been rigged to explode and had been set on a delayed charge either on purpose or not. It is a sad day for the NCR, as hundreds of innocent lives and a stable in pristine condition were lost forever."
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.3.a:0 "Amazing how far some ponies go to protect their secrets."
 
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.4.t:0 "The Lair of a False Goddess"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.4.d:0 "Maripony used to be a MAS base where some of the most vile biological experiments of the war were carried out under Twilight Sparkle. It was here that the fabled 'Goddess' turned countless ponies into the hive minded army of alicorns that terrorized the Wastes. It was also here that the famed Twilight Sparkle had met her end and had presumably become part of the 'Goddess'. Now the facility that was once an engine of terror lies in near complete ruin, with most of the facility having been bombed rubble with only a few intact rooms. It was dangerous work clearing the rubble and getting a crew to extract anything valuable but our crews managed it eventually.\nExploring what's left of Maripony yielded little but we managed to recover pieces of what was used to hold IMP and some fragments of data on the research of it. As for the substance itself, all of the vats of IMP were destroyed and we have only managed to recover small amounts of it that were sent to New Canterlot for analysis. We have also managed to recover numerous plasma weapons that were used by the hellhounds of Splendid Valley in their fight against the alicorns.\nWe may never know the full extent of what Maripony held, but the pieces that were left behind could still be of some use to us, as studying the nature of the IMP traces could help us further understand the biology of the former unity alicorns."
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.4.a:0 "Another terror of the Wasteland vanquished."
 
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.5.t:0 "The Lightbringer's Home"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.5.d:0 "This stable was certainly a game changer to recent wasteland history as it was the home and birthplace of the famous singer Velvet Remedy and the pipbuck technician that followed her Littlepip, the stable was also the final resting place of Ministry Mare Applejack as well as home to the last descendants of the Apple family. The stable was designed to never open its residence to the wider wasteland until the escape of Velvet Remedy had changed that, and now large swaths of the stable's population now live among the wastes, mostly within the NCR. Now that the stable is within our administration we're now able to extract anything useful to us. The crew that was sent were welcomed by the dwellers who remained in the stable, and the crew had brought along former dwellers who left as ambassadors that will help the integration of Stable 2 and its remaining population. We were given some amounts of the Stable's technology as removing all of its value would render it non-functional, which would not be great for the residence there. Still, we got what we could, and our ambassadors promise that the remaining dwellers of Stable 2 will be proud citizens of the NCR."
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.5.a:0 "Welcome to the NCR."
 
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.6.t:0 "Birthplace of a Terror"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.6.d:0 "Stable 101 was built in the heart of the Everfree forest under the ruins of the Castle of the Two Sisters, the first Capital of Equestria and the original homeplace of the Elements of harmony. Now it's known as The Cathedral, the heart of Red Eye's empire of slavery, and now The Cathedral lies in ruin after Red Eye's dream of godhood and a new unity had demised. Digging through the ruins had been a challenge as there were still pockets of slavers but they were neutralized and the slaves freed. Going through Stable 101 itself had revealed large quantities of cybernetic and medical technologies and research that were perhaps brought in the stable before the war as an experiment, like how most stables in the wasteland were used for experiments. Exploring the ruins of The Cathedral and the stable below had revealed the twisted plans Red Eye had for the wasteland in his horrendous vision of reuniting Equestria in his image.\nWhen everything valuable was gathered it was decided that the stable will be used for residency and that The Cathedral was to be repurposed back to the Castle of the Two Sisters and used as a museum for Equestrian history from the beginning to today."
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.6.a:0 "History both good and bad was made here."
 
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.7.t:0 "The Darkest Secrets of Stable-Tec"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.7.d:0 "Stable-Tec HQ was the key base of operations of the Stable-Tec corporation that have built hundreds of stables across the wasteland that have saved countless lives during the Great War. It was also home of the Fillydelphia contingent of the Steel Rangers, our soldiers fought viciously against the more technologically advanced rangers but our numbers had beat them out to secure the HQ.\nMuch of the building's lower floors were ruined during the battle and the Maneframes were destroyed by the rangers before we could secure it, so little data was recovered when we scavenged the place. What we did manage to get a lot of was Steel Ranger weaponry and Power Armor as well as Stable-tec Technology such as a stash of Pipbucks.\nIt's unknown what secrets were lost in the destroyed Maneframes but some of what we have gathered was details on other stables and that the majority of them had been used for experiments most of which sounded nefarious and likely did not end well. The silver lining was that we managed to get the location of all these stables which were marked for future exploration. The Maneframs were perhaps the only places of Stable-tec's darkest secrets, but the one way to find out is through the many stables that they have built."
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.7.a:0 "If only we secured the Maneframes..."
 
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.8.t:0 "A Gangster's Paradise"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.8.d:0 "Silverwing Army Depot was a massive military storage facility that was built and used before the war to store defensive weaponry and provide adequate supply to the defense from the Zebrican invasion during the Great War. In recent years the depot has come under the occupation of a group of organized criminals known as the Triggercolts, who have terrorized areas nearby the depot for many years. A detachment of NCR soldiers was sent to clear out the depot of this unruly gang and within a few days the gang had surrendered the base to us and the survivors of this gang were arrested.\n\nThe depot is in a special state of disarray given the recent battle and the activity of its recent residence so not much of the depots contents was recovered, but we managed to recover decent amounts of pre-war weaponry and equipment as well as large quantities of various robots in a separate room. It was given that the gang did not touch this area much given their lack of knowledge of robotics, the robots were transferred and are now mostly within the custody of the NCR military. The depot will eventually be retrofitted back to its purpose as a weapons storage facility as well as setting up an arms workshop to produce and repair more weaponry."
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.8.a:0 "So much for paradise Triggercolts..."
 
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.9.t:0 "The Matter of Stable 32"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.9.d:0 "Most Stables in the wastes are in no real shape to be of much use to our pursuits. Stable 32 was one of the few exceptions to this, being in remarkable condition thanks to it still being occupied for the past two centuries. It's dwellers may of resisted being liberated, but they have been taken care of and we are left with full access to their former home.\n\n Their experiment was fascinating, dealing with how two different societies with drastically different views on technology could get along, with Stable-Tecs hope being that either one side would prove their way to be objectively superior, or that the two could peacefully unite and move together in peace. While this would allow us to learn all sorts about how ponies function, it is far from what we are actually after in the stable. Instead, our interest is in all of the technology and resources used as part of its construction. Specialized electronics, computers, air filters, and much more can be put to our uses. The entire stable shall be scrapped, with every asset we can find put to use."
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.9.a:0 "So ends Stable 32."
 
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.10.t:0 "The lessons of automation"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.10.d:0 "Stable 29 was one of the many stables marked for being stripped of any useful technology and other useful materials. When the troop detachment was sent to secure the stable they were met with a massive robotic security presence and had to call in much support to clear out the security and secure the stable. The pony inhabitants had been long dead as several skeletons were discovered in various states of decay throughout the isolated corners of the stable. Examining the Maneframe revealed that one of the critical components for water filtration was broken and that the AI that had run the stable deduced that reducing the population would save the water supply and by extent the stable and eventually the entire population of the stable was killed off by the AI. We haven't recovered much in the ways of weaponry but much of the stable's pre-war technology was left relatively intact so we have managed to acquire large amounts of pre-war tech to help improve our country.\n\nThe fate of those who lived here must have been a bad one, but there aren't many around to care."
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.10.a:0 "Such is the idea of putting the fate of your wellbeing in AI."
 
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.11.t:0 "The MoM Hub"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.11.d:0 "Within the depths of Manehatten lay a building that is not at all what we expected. The Ministry of Morale was once responsible for identifying and countering all Zebrican espionage, along with ensuring the loyalty of Equestrian citizens and their dedication to the war effort. Going into their Manehatten Hub, we were expecting it to be at the center of a widespread surveillance system, or full of torture and memory extraction chambers. What we were not expecting were birthday cards and two century old cakes.\n\n It seems that the Ministry was pursuing the truly monumental task of tracking and celebrating the birthdays of every single foal in Manehatten. We're honestly not sure what to think about this. More in line to what we were expecting, we did find a great deal of spritebots that had to be dealt with in order to secure the building, along with what we believe to be the remains of Ministry Mare Pinkie Pie herself. The remains will be buried on what we believe to have once been her families rock farm."
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.11.a:0 "Alright then."
 
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.12.t:0 "Bucklyn Cross"
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.12.d:0 "With the Manehatten Steel Ranger's former center of operations now under our control, we can go to work exploring and excavating the facility. They were based out of Bucklyn Cross, which seems to have had an old military bunker located within the bridges supports. Though they stripped their armouries dry, and have made sure to leave as little as possible for us to salvage, we have still managed to find bits and bobs here and there that are of potential use to us. Furthermore, the entire bunker itself may be torn apart and its resources used in other projects."
 shatteredhoof_ncr_decisions.12.a:0 "Yet another old ruin dealt with."
