 FSR_theelder_desc:0 "Старейшина Блюберри Сейбр, нынешняя глава Филлидельфийского отделения, пребывает у власти уже долгое время."


### Industry Tree ###
 FSR_newindustry:0 "Промышленность Филлидельфии"
 FSR_newindustry_desc:0 "Большая часть филлидельфийской промышленности находится на севере в копытах Красного Глаза, мы держим какую-то часть на юге. До войны в Филлидельфии располагались многие промышленные титаны, главным образом 'Стойл-Тек'. Мы возродим былое величие!"
 
 FSR_out_docks:0 "Дальние верфи"
 FSR_out_docks_desc:0 "ВМФ Эквестрии фактически больше не существует, ныне только дураки и пираты выходят в море или сплавляются по рекам. Старейшина отдала приказ отремонтировать сохранившиеся доки и пустить их в дело, дабы мы могли вовремя восстановить флот."
 
 FSR_filly_pumps:0 "Водяные насосы на Филли"
 FSR_filly_pumps_desc:0 "Стальные Рейнджеры, в отличие от многих на пустоши, не утратили знаний об очистке больших масс воды. С помощью новых насосных станций на северном берегу Филли мы, применив эти знания, удовлетворим запросы растущего населения и развивающейся промышленности."
 
 FSR_down_rennovation:0 "Реновация Саут-Энда"
 FSR_down_rennovation_desc:0 "Слишком долго мощности Саут-Энда лежали в руинах — теперь, когда сопротивление там подавлено, мы можем восстановить какую-то часть инфраструктуры. Это лишь первый шаг на пути к возвращению довоенной промышленности."
 
 FSR_hq_touchup:0 "Обновить штаб-квартиру"
 FSR_hq_touchup_desc:0 "На более чем два столетия Стальные Рейнджеры Филлидельфии облюбовали бункеры и тоннели под штаб-квартирой 'Стойл-Тек'. Мы хорошо заботились о нашем доме, но строения на поверхности давным-давно обратились в развалины. Нам не составит труда восстановить линии электропередач и отстроить как минимум два надземных этажа."
 
 FSR_consumer_circuitry:0 "Собрать бытовую электротехнику"
 FSR_consumer_circuitry_desc:0 "Во время войны Филлидельфия была центром разработки и изготовления электронных товаров. Многие фабрики и цеха до сих пор никем не тронуты: роботы-охранники исправно несут службу и спустя двести лет."
 
 FSR_rebuild_robco:0 "Отстроить 'Робронко'"
 FSR_rebuild_robco_desc:0 "'Робронко' были одной из крупнейших, если не самой крупной компанией по производству робототехники в военные годы. Сначала они собирали в основном гражданские модели, но с эскалацией конфликта конвеер стал штамповать легионы протектопони и других боевых роботов."

 FSR_room_progress:0 "Дорогу прогрессу"
 FSR_room_progress_desc:0 "Быть может, мы и входим в число самых развитых группировок на пустоши, но даже мы восстановили лишь крупицу от былой промышленной мощи Эквестрии. Если мы хотим возродить цивилизацию когда-нибудь в будущем, нам необходимо расчистить завалы и проложить нормальные дороги."
 
 FSR_talk_to_trinity:0 "Первая просьба"
 FSR_talk_to_trinity_desc:0 "'Троица' просит, чтобы его лично посетил [ROOT.GetLeader]. Видимо, мейнфрейм хочет обратиться с какой-то просьбой."

 FSR_art_factory:0 "Завод реактивной артиллерии"
 FSR_art_factory_desc:0 "После того, как мы расчистили завалы, все алгоритмы 'Триединства' подсчитали и указали на одну конкретную область. Там под поверхностью земли мы обнаружили секретный довоенный завод по выпуску реактивной артиллерии. Он сохранился идеально — осталось только провести электричество."
 
 FSR_thousand_gears:0 "Тысяча приводов"
 FSR_thousand_gears_desc:0 "Наша промышленность растёт не по дням, а по часам, пожирая горы ресурсов и исторгая ещё больше оружия. Если мы хотим сохранить стабильный рост и в будущем, нам придётся оптимизировать расход каждого привода, каждой бутыли воды, каждой капли топлива — всё будет использовано по максиму во имя нашей цели."
 
 FSR_new_hq:0 "Последняя просьба"
 FSR_new_hq_desc:0 "И опять 'Троица' призывает нас к себе, но что-то, кажется, идёт не так..."
 
 FSR_best_guns:0 "Лучшие пушки на пустоши"

 FSR_track_guns:0 "Орудия на траках"
 FSR_track_guns_desc:0 "Мы привели в порядок промышленные мощности и восстановили стандарты производства, так что пора собрать осколки довоенных танковых проектов и ворваться в новый век на рокочущих траках."
 
 
### Navy Tree ###
 
 FSR_surface_navy:0 "Надводный флот"
 FSR_surface_navy_desc:0 "Нашими нынешними методами и технологиями попросту невозможно воссоздать современные авианосцы и подводные лодки, составлявшие костяк ВМФ Эквестрии. Нам надо мыслить более старыми категориями, когда вершиной морских сражений были галеры и абордаж."
 
 FSR_new_harbor:0 "Новая гавань"
 FSR_new_harbor_desc:0 "Теперь, когда мы можем спускать на воду корабли, пора заново отстроить комплекс больших и малых доков на юге Филлидельфии."
 
 FSR_mobile_ships:0 "Манёвренные корабли"
 FSR_mobile_ships_desc:0 "Одним из главных врагов нашего нового флота станут многочисленные пираты, коими кишат моря и реки. Так как они в основном плавают на юрких каноэ и моторных лодках, то и мы должны спроектировать такие суда, что смогут догнать и уничтожить их."
 
 FSR_naval_doctrine:0 "Военно-морская теория"
 FSR_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "Мейнфрейм 'Стойл-Тек' содержит 2492 документа о теории военно-морского дела со схемами и описаниями тактик. Можно заняться их изучением, чтобы лучше понимать принципы войны на море." 
 
 FSR_big_ships:0 "Плавучие чудища"
 FSR_big_ships_desc:0 "Чтобы соревноваться с другими морскими державами, нам нужны крупные корабли с такой огневой мощью на борту, что хватило бы сравнять с землёй небольшой городок. Для этого необходимо выпускать более крупные корпуса и чертить схемы нового оружия."
 
 FSR_naval_guns:0 "Корабельные батареи"
 FSR_naval_guns_desc:0 "Мало что способно посоперничать с корабельными орудиями довоенной Эквестрии в плане калибра и ужасной огневой мощи. Нам потребуется много металла, пороха и топлива, чтобы наладить их выпуск, но они заставят наших врагов дрожать от страха."
 
 FSR_waste_navy:0 "Флот пустоши"
 FSR_waste_navy_desc:0 "Пустошь небогата на ресурсы, и содержать флотилию крупных кораблей будет попросту разорительно. Если вместо этого сосредоточиться на массовом производстве небольших судов, мы станем грозной силой на море!
 
 FSR_war_navy:0 "Флот военного времени"
 FSR_war_navy_desc:0 "Мы приложим все усилия, чтобы возродить ВМФ Эквестрии, каким он был в военные годы. Лишь тогда мы удовлетворимся, когда все моря от Сталлионграда до Зебрики будут под нашим контролем!"
 
 FSR_rule_seas:0 "Правь морями!"
 FSR_rule_seas_desc:0 "На подготовку и строительство ушли целые годы, но, наконец-таки, наш флот действительно впечатляет! Отныне никто не будет нам ровней. Правь, МЫ, морями!
 
### Army Tree ###

 FSR_ajarmy:0 "Новые рейнджеры Эпплджек"
 FSR_ajarmy_desc:0 "Прошли дни, когда немногочисленной, хорошо вооружённой элиты было достаточно для выживания. Мы должны принять в наши ряды жителей пустоши, если не хотим потерять доминирующее положение."
 
 FSR_healthyarmy:0 "Здоровые солдаты"
 FSR_healthyarmy_desc:0 "Практика выявила одну серьёзную проблему в нашей новой военной доктрине: намного более высокие, чем раньше, потери. Необходимо что-то предпринять, дабы гарантировать личному составу шанс на выживание."
 
 FSR_saddlearmy:0 "Новые боевые сёдла"
 FSR_saddlearmy_desc:0 "Множество наших боевых сёдл были собраны ещё до войны и предназначены для мелкокалиберного оружия. Нужно разработать новые образцы, если нашим солдатам нужны пушки потяжелее."

 FSR_steellegion:0 "Стальной легион"
 FSR_steellegion_desc:0 "Сталь и плоть, тяжёлые рыцари и рекруты с пустошей — они наступают на врага единым фронтом. Никто не устоит пред поступью нашего стального легиона."

 FSR_priviarmy:0 "Привилегии для рейнджеров"
 FSR_priviarmy_desc:0 "Рейнджеры — самое отборное боевое формирование на пустоши, и мы это докажем."
 
 FSR_stabletecproject:0 "Технологии 'Стойл-Тек'"
 FSR_stabletecproject_desc:0 "До войны 'Стойл-Тек' была одной из самых инновационных компаний в Эквестрии. Их мейнфрейм содержит множество ценных данных, но все они зашифрованы. К счастью, писцы уверены, что могут взломать код — надо только подождать."
 
 FSR_superiorarmor:0 "Модернизация брони"
 FSR_superiorarmor_desc:0 "Наши рыцари сумели придумать пару способов упростить производство силовой брони и улучшить непосредственно её качество."
 
 FSR_assaultweapons:0 "Тяжёлое штурмовое оружие"

 FSR_elitescouts:0 "Отборные разведчики"
 FSR_elitescouts_desc:0 "Бездумная атака в лоб приносит только трупы. Мы должны проявлять осторожность и прибегать к разведке, чтобы быть в курсе любых неожиданностей."
 
 FSR_rangerdoctrine:0 "Доктрина рейнджеров"
 FSR_rangerdoctrine_desc:0 "Силовая броня была столпом нашей военной доктрины на протяжении двухсот лет. Зачем отказываться от неё сейчас?"
 
 FSR_rangerarmy:0 "Армия рейнджеров"
 FSR_rangerarmy_desc:0 "Наши солдаты чеканят шаг навстречу врагу, закованные в сталь. Может, это и не самая огромная армия на пустоши, но уж точно самая отборная."
 
 FSR_raiderarmy:0 "Рейдерский корпус"
 FSR_raiderarmy_desc:0 "Наши войска сильно ограничены недостатком живой силы, а на границах хозяйничают рейдерские банды, отторженные Красным Глазом. Может, получится убить разом двух грифонов?"
 
 FSR_fortresscity:0 "Город-цитадель"
 FSR_fortresscity_desc:0 "Много кто сомневается, сможем ли мы оборонять нашу штаб-квартиру в случае продолжительной осады. Надо тщательным образом подговиться к чему бы то ни было."
 
 FSR_agressiveneg:0 "Воинственная дипломатия"
 FSR_agressiveneg_desc:0 "Кричи громко и держи при себе большую дубину."
 
 FSR_newdoctrine:0 "Новая доктрина"
 FSR_newdoctrine_desc:0 "Дни силовой брони, когда она правила полем боя, сочтены. Чтобы не отстать от соседей, нам нужна большая, приведённая под единый стандарт армия."
 
 FSR_biggerguns:0 "Большие пушки"
 FSR_biggerguns_desc:0 "Большие пушки для большой армии. Избыток огневой мощи, в конце концов, ещё никому не вредил."

 FSR_raiderworkshops:0 "Рейдерские цеха"
 FSR_raiderworkshops_desc:0 "Рейдеры обустроили логова в нескольких старых заводах, в которых мы очень заинтересованы. Здесь можно достичь некоего соглашения..."
 
 FSR_raiderdrugs:0 "Рейдерские наркотики"
 FSR_raiderdrugs_desc:0 "Рейдеры употребляют море разной химии как в бою, так и на отдыхе. Хотя, вообще-то, многие эти препараты предназначены для медицинского использования."
 
 FSR_raiderpaladins:0 "Рейдеры-паладины"
 FSR_raiderpaladins_desc:0 "Как стальной прилив, исторгнутый пастью самого Тартара, они несутся и сметают всё на своём пути. Сила не самая отборная и не самая дисциплинированная, но одна из самых ужасающих — без сомнения." 
 
 
### Opening Political Tree ###
 FSR_thescribes:0 "Вопрос писцов"
 FSR_thescribes_desc:0 "Писцы были административным и научным фундаментом нашего ордена на протяжении веков. Но относительно их будущего есть некоторые вопросы..."
 
 FSR_theknights:0 "Вопрос партизан"
 FSR_theknights_desc:0 "Мы не одни в этой части Филлидельфии. Многие чужеземцы также населяют нашу землю, и немногие из них разделяют наши цели. Конфликты между нами и ними привели к формированию группы так называемых 'Партизан', которая сопротивляется каждом нашему шагу. Они представляют собой проблему, которую нужно решить."
 
 FSR_poldivisions:0 "Идейный разброд"
 FSR_poldivisions_desc:0 "Многие обитатели пустошей и члены нашего собственного отделения начали сомневаться в нашей миссии. Старейшина должна выбрать, к чьему совету прислушаться, — будущее туманно..."
 
 FSR_stablemainframe:0 "Мейнфрейм 'Стойл-Тек'"
 FSR_stablemainframe_desc:0 "Мейнфрейм 'Стойл-Тек' - загадочный механизм, набитый технологическими чудесами, и мы только начали раскрывать её секреты."
 
 FSR_industriallegacy:0 "Наследие нашей промышленности"
 FSR_industriallegacy_desc:0 "Large swaths of southern Fillydelphia are devoted to industries of all kinds, but in the chaos, we could only save some of them."
 
 FSR_industyfocus:0 "Цель нашей промышленности"
 FSR_industyfocus_desc:0 "Our economy is in limbo. With Red Eye breathing down our necks, we're pressured to spare nothing for our civilians and focus only on our military; however, our ponies would suffer from this and we could rather help them first. After all, a happy pony is a loyal one. The Elder, however, would rather just make a few tweaks and leave it at that..."
 
 FSR_blueberry:0 "Блюберри Сейбр сохраняет позиции"
 FSR_blueberry_desc:0 "In a snap election, it was concluded that Elder Blueberry will continue to hold her position as Elder. She promises to continue her balanced approach, keeping our Mission in mind."
 
 FSR_strawberry:0 "Строберри Лемонейд становится старейшиной"
 FSR_strawberry_desc:0 "In a snap election, it was concluded that Paladin Strawberry Lemonade will take reins of the Chapter. She promises to have an emphasis on those outside the Chapter. "
 
 FSR_badpony:0 "Нова Рейдж приходит к власти"
 FSR_badpony_desc:0 "In a snap election, it was concluded that Star-Paladin Nova Rage will assume control of the Chapter. She has expressed the controversial idea of forming an alliance with Red Eye and has called for us to exert our control over the 'inferior' Wastelanders. She decides to..."

 ###Continuation###

 FSR_enemydoor:0 "Враг на пороге"
 FSR_enemydoor_desc:0 "Sunnyshore has fallen and its ponies are being marched off in chains to work in Red Eye's factories. Many in our ranks fear that we will be the next target of his conquest, so we must decide what to do about it."
 
 FSR_aggressivestance:0 "Aggressive Stance"
 FSR_aggressivestance_desc:0 "Лучшая защита — нападение!"
 
 FSR_defensivestance:0 "Defensive Stance"
 FSR_defensivestance_desc:0 "Defence is the best defence!"
 
 FSR_fightmadagascar:0 "Битва за Дипуотер"
 FSR_fightmadagascar_desc:0 "The region of Deepwater shares a large border with our realm, and is only lightly defended. We might be able to take it even with limited military action."
 
 FSR_fortifymadagascar:0 "Укрепить Дипуотер"
 FSR_fortifymadagascar_desc:0 "Deepwater is in our hooves, and we must secure it in order to prevent Red Eye from taking it back!"
 
 FSR_househardpoint:0 "Каждая пядь асфальта"
 FSR_househardpoint_desc:0 "Раз Красный Глаз хочет весь город только себе, его армия сломает об нас зубы! Засады на каждом углу, снайперы в окнах, бункеры в подвалах, круглосуточные патрули... Улицы потонут в крови его приспешников, если я буду вынуждена сдать Филлидельфию!"
 
 FSR_mechaspritemines:0 "Спрайтбот-мины"
 FSR_mechaspritemines_desc:0 "Originally developed by Robronco as construction robots, these parasprite-inspired constructs have the ability to replicate themselves. If we put the Stable-Tec Maneframe in charge of them and give it the directive to defend the city, they could be very useful."
 
 FSR_hqprotectrons:0 "Перепрограммировать системы штаб-квартиры"
 FSR_hqprotectrons_desc:0 "The Stable-Tec HQ is home to hundreds of automated security systems. Even if we only manage to reprogram 10% of them, they would be a welcome addition to our defences."
 
 FSR_defensenetwork:0 "Finish Autonomous Defence Network"
 FSR_defensenetwork_desc:0 "Before the War, countless anti-air hardpoints were built in Fillydelphia, with the intention of linking them to a Crusader Maneframe that would use them to shoot down any dragon or missile that dared enter our airspace. The project was never completed, but we can bring back a diminished version of it in our half of Fillyddelphia."
 
 FSR_stable2expedition:0 "Экспедиция в Стойло 2"
 FSR_stable2expedition_desc:0 "Stable 2, more than a hundred miles to the west of Stable-Tec HQ, is a true treasure trove of advanced technology! We will continue our mission to secure such technology, and prepare an expedition to make the long journey to the Stable!"
 
 FSR_steelalliance:0 "Стальной альянс"
 FSR_steelalliance_desc:0 "Too long has every Chapter of the Steel Rangers stood alone against the world! We shall ask all our Brothers and Sisters far and wide to join together in a grand alliance, so that we may stand against any foe!"
 
 FSR_newrations:0 "Новые пайки"
 FSR_newrations_desc:0 "In the depths of the Stable-Tec HQ, there lay countless storerooms, some filled to the top with non-perishables. The Elder has decided that now is the time to use this reserve to increase rations and allow couples to have more foals. We'll need them in the wars to come."
 
 FSR_newknights:0 "Expand the Knights"
 FSR_newknights_desc:0 "We are in a precarious situation. With Red Eye knocking on our door and the Enclave rearing it's ugly head, we will need every hoof on deck and ready to fight! Therefore, Blueberry Sabre intends to abolish retirement for Knights and get many of the old guard back into active service."
 
 FSR_steelyouth:0 "Youth Training Program"
 FSR_steelyouth_desc:0 "It is never a good sign when a military lowers the age of conscription, but we are strapped for ponypower and must therefore prepare everypony that can fire a rifle to be ready for the fight of their lives."
 
 FSR_morescribes:0 "Expand the Scribes"  
 FSR_morescribes_desc:0 "The Scribes are vital to our production and research capabilities. If we want to remain ahead of the wasteland rabble, we will need to expand their ranks!"
 
 FSR_superscribes:0 "Bunker Schools"
 FSR_superscribes_desc:0 "The kids need to go to school. The kids also need to be kept safe. The obvious solution to both of these problems is to build our schools in the form of underground bunkers!"
 
 FSR_techreclaim:0 "Reclaim Lost Technology"
 FSR_techreclaim_desc:0 "Our Mission has always been, and will always be, the reclamation and protection of all old-world technology. Today we celebrate that Mission, and how much we have achieved already."
 
 FSR_raidsilver:0 "Raid Silverwing for Tech"
 FSR_raidsilver_desc:0 "The Silverwing Army Depot is relatively close to our base of operations and only protected by some incompetent mobsters. If we attack with surprise and ferocity, we will surely be able to liberate whatever technology they are hoarding there."
 
 FSR_raidpit:0 "Raid the Pit for Blueprints"
 FSR_raidpit_desc:0 "The is one of the largest industrial centres of the Wasteland. It contains thousands of workers and metric tons of electronics, advanced technology, and weapons. It is also filled to the brim with armed slavers and even more armed Talons. If we wish to acquire some of its treasures, we will have to be sneaky..."
 
 FSR_slapredeye:0 "Put Red Eye in His Place"
 FSR_slapredeye_desc:0 "The time has come to end the Wasteland's greatest menace! No longer shall Red Eye hoard slaves and technology he doesn't even understand. We shall liberate the technology... and the slaves too, I guess."
 
 FSR_demeter:0 "Проект 'Деметра'"
 FSR_demeter_desc:0 "Few are those in the Wasteland that have never known hunger, but there are methods to solve such problems..."
 
 FSR_haephestus:0 "Проект 'Гефест'"
 FSR_haephestus_desc:0 "Beneath all the gunfire and screaming, if you listen very carefully, you can hear the roaring of an enormous furnace. An infernal machine that is fed day and night by the scraps of the Old World, in order to produce thousands upon thousands of guns and munitions."
 
 FSR_con_the_new_territories:0 "Administrating the New Territories"
 FSR_con_the_new_territories_desc:0 "We now find ourselves with quite a lot of land, and not enough ponies to govern it all. In order to help deal with it all, we shall be establishing civilian governments to handle large stretches of this land, while being overseen by loyal rangers. This will hopefully also calm tensions with the locals and help avert any future uprising against us."
 
 FSR_con_emancipation:0 "Освобождение"
 FSR_con_emancipation_desc:0 "We've found ourselves with a large supply of slaves, and unfortunately we have no idea what to do with them. We can't afford to feed and clothe them, we have no idea how to prevent them from rebelling, and we really have no need for them. So, as a solution to this problem, we are simply going to proclaim their freedom. They'll surely appreciate it."
 
 FSR_con_subjugation:0 "Закабаление"
 FSR_con_subjugation_desc:0 "With so many slaves, what else is there to do but to put them to work? We'll be nicer to them then Red Eye was, certainly, and they'll soon come to appreciate the benefits of living under our protection and rule."
 
 FSR_con_old_quotas:0 "Ввести старые нормы"
 FSR_con_old_quotas_desc:0 "Red Eye worked these slaves to the bone. Unfortunately for them, we have no intention of changing that. They'll work to produce all we need, and they'll be glad for our protection while they do it."
 
 FSR_con_expand_foundries:0 "Expand the Foundries"
 FSR_con_expand_foundries_desc:0 "Red Eye's steel production was one of the main backbones of his industry. We're going to need a lot of this steel if we're going to keep our own forces supplied, so it would be in our best interest to extend his steel mills."
 
 FSR_con_slave_rangers:0 "Принимать рабов в рейнджеры"
 FSR_con_slave_rangers_desc:0 "Our strict recruitment standards are what allowed us to maintain the most professional army in the Wasteland. However, we can no longer rely on a small elite force to protect all of our territory. To ensure that we can protect all of our new land, we must begin looking for new recruits. And what better source than the recently freed slaves, who would be fully willing to die for their liberators?"
 
 FSR_con_slave_compromise:0 "Большой компромисс"
 FSR_con_slave_compromise_desc:0 "Some of the former slaves have proven to not be as grateful as we would hope. These so-called 'Unions' are stirring trouble, with their pesky demands for self-governence and representation for the masses. Though we would never oblige such silly demands, we are forced to reach some sort of agreement with them. Paladin Strawberry Lemonade has come up with a proposal to appease them, while still keeping our own power. In exchange for limited autonomy being granted to the former slaves communities, they will be expected to serve in the defence of our nation should we ever be threatened. "
 
 FSR_con_scour_ruins:0 "Обыскать руины Филлидельфии"
 FSR_con_scour_ruins_desc:0 "The ruins of Fillydelphia are a treasure trove of useful materials. With a bit of effort, we could seek out all of this treasure to help fuel our own industrial efforts."
 
 FSR_con_rebuild_key_infra:0 "Rebuild Key Infrastructure"
 FSR_con_rebuild_key_infra_desc:0 "Despite all of Red Eye's work towards rebuilding Fillydelphia, one aspect of the city was near entirely ignored: it's infrastructure. We will focus on that which he overlooked, and work on bringing water purification centers and power plants back online. Every ranger shall get to know the joys of clean water and airconditioning, and I can finally power that old massage chair that's been sitting in storage for ages."
 
 FSR_con_united_filly:0 "Единая Филлидельфия"
 FSR_con_united_filly_desc:0 "Riots are only monthly now rather than weekly, and quite a lot of work has been done in regards to consolidating our control. With the resistence efforts quickly fading away, we can finally say with full confidence that Fillydelphia is under our control at last. Now we can begin turning our attention to our other territories, and to the threads that surround them."
 
 FSR_con_flatlands_industry:0 "Subsidize the Flatland's Industry"
 FSR_con_flatlands_industry_desc:0 "What we now call the Flatlands was, under Red Eye's rule, largely an expanse of nothingness. It was merely the land that connected Fillydelphia to the Cathedral, and as such, had no real development other than roads and rails. This has left our administration over it in a bit of a rough spot, so to help them out we will be funding the creation of factories across their land.

 FSR_sl_unions:0 "Сделка с союзами"
 FSR_sl_unions_desc:0 "With our population more organized then ever before, various unions advocating for workers rights have formed and are demanding concessions."
 
 FSR_sl_labor_laws:0 "Protect Our Workers"
 FSR_sl_labor_laws_desc:0 "With cooperation from the unions, the Bureau has come up with various laws and regulations designed to help keep our workers safe and happy."
 
 FSR_sl_happy_pony:0 "Реформировать министерства"
 FSR_sl_happy_pony_desc:0 "During the War, the Ministries controlled almost all facets of the Equestrian government. It is time they do so once more."
 
 FSR_sl_inter_relations:0 "Interspecies Relations"
 FSR_sl_inter_relations_desc:0 "In the interest of peaceful integration, we should make an effort to study and understand the customs and ways of the various non-pony creatures living within our borders."
 
 FSR_sl_harmony_theory:0 "Теория гармонии"
 FSR_sl_harmony_theory_desc:0 "Пони, псы, грифоны, многие другие... Когда столько существ трудится сообща и перенимает опыт друг друга, небывалое процветание неизбежно."
 
 FSR_sl_cultural_integration:0 "Школа им. Строберри для одарённых эквестрийцев"
 FSR_sl_cultural_integration_desc:0 "As part of our efforts to restore Equestria to its pre-war state, we have decided to establish an institution of higher learning. This great school, named after our Grand Regent Herself, shall help launch our technology into the future! Or rather, the past."
 
 FSR_sl_country_united:0 "Единая страна"
 FSR_sl_country_united_desc:0 "Кантерлот наш! Нам надо как можно скорее начать отстраивать разрушенное и снова сделать его столицей Эквестрии."
 
 FSR_sl_god_dead:0 "Мёртвая богиня"
 FSR_sl_god_dead_desc:0 "Luna is dead. While working to clear and restore the Canterlot Palace, we discovered and identified Her remains. The Grand Regent has called for a national day of mourning, and will be organizing a funeral for our fallen princess."
 
 FSR_sl_march_azure:0 "Cross the Azureway"
 FSR_sl_march_azure_desc:0 "The Azureway is one of the largest rivers in southern Equestria. As a result, the entire surrounding region is named after it. It's about time we reclaim that region."
 
 FSR_sl_march_manehattan:0 "Марш на Мейнхеттен"
 FSR_sl_march_manehattan_desc:0 "Некогда Мейнхеттен был средоточием торговли и материального достатка. Возможно, если мы возьмём его под свой контроль, он вновь станет таким."
 
 FSR_sl_mwt:0 "Министерство Военных Технологий"
 FSR_sl_mwt_desc:0 "The Ministry of Wartime Technology was dedicated to managing and expanding Equestria's manufacturing capabilities during the War, along with developing both military and industrial technology. As the other Ministries all fell with Equestria, the MWT remained in the form of the Steel Rangers. Now, it is time to restore the Ministry as it was meant to be."
 
 FSR_sl_mwt2:0 "A New Ministry Hub"
 FSR_sl_mwt2_desc:0 "Though our current facilities have served our military well, they are ill-suited for a civilian Ministry. Therefore, a new Ministry Hub shall be constructed in Fillydelphia for our civilian employees to work from. "
 
 FSR_sl_mwt3:0 "НИЦ военного времени"
 FSR_sl_mwt3_desc:0 "With its new Hub completed, the Ministry may resume many of its research projects from before the world went to Tartarus. With a focus on military advancements, of course."
 
 FSR_sl_mwt4:0 "Антимех-винтовки"
 FSR_sl_mwt4_desc:0 "Anti-Machine Rifles were one of the many inventions to come out of the MWT during the War, as a counter to Zebrican robots. Though some are concerned that they could be used against our own power armoured soldiers, we fear that not investing in this technology leave us at a disadvantage. As such, we will resume the development of these weapons immediately. "
 
 FSR_sl_mwt5:0 "Скорострельное оружие"
 FSR_sl_mwt5_desc:0 "Though countering heavy armour is all fine and good, most of our enemies do not possess such heavy armour. If we wish to counter the raiders, the slavers, and even the alicorns, we should begin investing in fast firing low-calibre weaponry."
 
 FSR_sl_mwt6:0 "Модернизация силовой брони"
 FSR_sl_mwt6_desc:0 "Our power armour has served us well for over 200 years. However, there also haven't been any real advances in power armour technology in those 200 years. We think it's about time we improve upon our old designs, so that our soldiers may be protected in the wars to come."
 
 FSR_sl_mwt7:0 "Броня, тип 'Джаггернаут'"
 FSR_sl_mwt7_desc:0 "Juggernaut-class power armour is essentially a bulked-up version of our standard armour. It possesses additional plating, along with reinforced internal components. Though it may not be the cheapest thing to assemble, it will give our soldiers unrivalled protection."
 
 FSR_sl_mwt8:0 "Броня, тип XVII"
 FSR_sl_mwt8_desc:0 "The XVII-class power armour is named as such because it can be assembled out of only 17 distinct components. This makes it far easier to mass-produce than our current power armour, which is necessary if we wish to continue to expand our power armoured infantry."
 
 FSR_sl_mom:0 "Министерство Морали"
 FSR_sl_mom_desc:0 "The Ministry of Morale was founded with the responsibility of keeping civilian morale high. However, as the war escalated, they began to conduct counterespionage operations across all of Equestria. The measures they took in combating zebra infiltration only grew more and more invasive, until they were keeping an eye on every Equestrian, with little regard for personal rights."
 
 FSR_sl_mom2:0 "Реставрировать Ферму Развлечений"
 FSR_sl_mom2_desc:0 "The Fillydelphia Fun Farm was constructed as part of an initiative by the Ministry of Morale to provide fun and entertainment to the residents of Fillydelphia. We think it would make the perfect place to build a new Hub for our newly reformed Ministry."
 
 FSR_sl_mom3:0 "The Show Begins"
 FSR_sl_mom3_desc:0 "With the Hub complete, the Ministry of Morale may resume doing what it has always done: keeping spirits high."
 
 FSR_sl_mom4:0 "А ну-ка, улыбнись!"
 FSR_sl_mom4_desc:0 "Не грусти, смейся! А если не будешь, мы тебя найдём и заставим."
 
 FSR_sl_mom5:0 "Тётушка Пинки наблюдает за тобой"
 FSR_sl_mom5_desc:0 "Мы знаем, когда ты отходишь ко сну, и знаем, во сколько встаёшь из постели. Мы знаем, хорошо ты себя вёл или плохо. Будь умницей — не расстраивай Пинки!
 
 FSR_sl_mom6:0 "Дар Смеха"
 FSR_sl_mom6_desc:0 "Though life may be happy and joyful here in Equestria, the same can't be said about those outside of our borders. This is unacceptable. We will launch a campaign to cheer up all those unhappy frowny ponies across The Wasteland!"
 
 FSR_sl_mom7:0 "Жизнь за Эквестрию"
 FSR_sl_mom7_desc:0 "Помни: если ты не с нами, ты против нас! Наши земли кишат шпионами, предателями и теми, кто сочувствует зебрам, — все они развращают умы наших граждан. Любой, кого уличат в заговоре против великого регента, будет осуждён на службу в штрафбате, ибо только в смерти они могут искупить грехи.
 
 FSR_sl_mom8:0 "Вечеринка без конца"
 FSR_sl_mom8_desc:0 "Колёса! Химия! Дурь! Пони танцуют, вечеринка гремит, а солдаты забывают усталость. Министерству Морали надо заняться изучением, производством и распространением химических препаратов, чтобы повысить отдачу в наших войсках."
 
 FSR_sl_mop:0 "Министерство Мира"
 FSR_sl_mop_desc:0 "The Ministry of Peace was entrusted with caring for the public health and welfare of Equestria's citizens, as well as providing medical services for the Equestrian military, along with advancing research and development so as to assist in carrying out those responsibilities. Though many within our ranks scoff at the idea of reestablishing what they see as the most useless Ministry, we recognize the need for their services in ensuring a stable and healthy nation."
 
 FSR_sl_mop2:0 "The Hospital Hub"
 FSR_sl_mop2_desc:0 "In line with the Ministry of Peace's mission, we shall be restoring and expanding Fillydelphia's Hearts and Hooves Hospital to serve as both the cities primary health centre and the Ministries very own Hub. "
 
 FSR_sl_mop3:0 "Heal Without Discrimination"
 FSR_sl_mop3_desc:0 "We will make sure to treat all wounded, whether friend or foe... though the enemies wounded will be given to our interrogators afterwards."
 
 FSR_sl_mop4:0 "Develop New Medication"
 FSR_sl_mop4_desc:0 "Much of Equestria is still relying on medication manufactured during the War. This won't do at all! If we wish to have a healthy and happy people, we must begin by providing them with the medication that they need."
 
 FSR_sl_mop5:0 "Implement Factory Safety Standards"
 FSR_sl_mop5_desc:0 "In Red Eye's Fillydelphia, worker safety was hardly a concern. As a result, many of his old factories lack even the most basic safety features, such as guard rails.  The Ministry of Peace, in the interest of ensuring the well-being of Equestria's workers, will be launching a campaign to drastically improve the workplace safety of all factories deemed not up to code."
 
 FSR_sl_mop6:0 "Корпус мира"
 FSR_sl_mop6_desc:0 "The Peace Corps is perhaps one of the reformed Ministry of Peace's most popular proposals, with wide support from our more militaristic officials. They would be an organization of medical professionals, dedicated to the health and well-being of our mighty Equestrian military. After all, every dead soldier is a wasted soldier."
 
 FSR_sl_mop7:0 "Subdermal Healing Implants"
 FSR_sl_mop7_desc:0 "One of the newest innovations from the Ministry of Peace is an implant designed to automatically release a dosage of healing potion when needed. We plan on rolling this implant out to much of our military, so as to greatly improve their odds of surviving each battle."
 
 FSR_sl_mop8:0 "Ты слышал про антирадин..."
 FSR_sl_mop8_desc:0 "...но слышал ли ты про антирадин-2? That's right, this brand new improvement upon the old classic formula that you all know and love is capable of purging up to twice the amount of radiation! That's right, up to twice the amount! Plus, it's patented formula has been carefully designed to ensure minimal allergic reactions, something that was a bit of a problem with the old Rad-Away. So say goodbye radiation poisoning, and say hello to a brighter future! This ad paid for and sponsored by the Ministry of Peace."
 
 FSR_sl_moi:0 "Министерство Стиля"
 FSR_sl_moi_desc:0 "The Ministry of Image is perhaps the least remembered of all of the Ministries. Their work is everywhere: every street, every town, and every city contains their work. Yet, most ponies don't realize it. The Ministry of Image very rarely advertised itself, after all. They were responsible for the design, production, and distribution of both marketing materials and propaganda, across all of Equestria."
 
 FSR_sl_moi2:0 "Rebuild the Canterlot Hub"
 FSR_sl_moi2_desc:0 "The old Ministry of Image Hub in Canterlot is perhaps the most functional and least damaged of all of the Canterlot Hubs. Due to this, it has been decided that it will serve just fine as the primary hub of the reformed Ministry. All we need to do is clear a bit of rubble, fix a few things, and remove all these skeletons."
 
 FSR_sl_moi3:0 "Пропаганду — в массы"
 FSR_sl_moi3_desc:0 "Equestria may not be the unified nation it once was, but that won't stop us. We shall work around the clock to ensure that only the finest propaganda is being shown to every last Equestrian."
 
 FSR_sl_moi4:0 "Контроль над печатью"
 FSR_sl_moi4_desc:0 "Some less reputable sources seek to stir up trouble by making a big deal of every minor thing. Officials having affairs or accepting bribes is hardly newsworthy. And war crimes happen every single day! There's no reason why the good folks of Equestria need to be troubled with such nonsense. So, we shall strictly monitor and control all information being presented to the public, to ensure that it is worth their time of day."
 
 FSR_sl_moi5:0 "Exalt the Leadership"
 FSR_sl_moi5_desc:0 "Truly, Grand Regent Strawberry Lemonade and Her ponies could do nothing wrong. And soon, everyone in Equestria will believe it."
 
 FSR_sl_moi6:0 "Лучшая в мире страна"
 FSR_sl_moi6_desc:0 "Our citizens should feel blessed to live in such a great nation. No other nation is as prosperous and happy as our own! Anyone who says otherwise is clearly spreading sedition."
 
 FSR_sl_moi7:0 "Radicalize the Populus"
 FSR_sl_moi7_desc:0 "The enemy is weak, for they are unenlightened and savage. The enemy is strong, for they are many and unflinching. We must all be willing to make sacrifices, for the greater good of all of Equestria."
 
 FSR_sl_moi8:0 "Войны за \"Освобождение\""
 FSR_sl_moi8_desc:0 "Our wars are justified, for they are not intended to kill and conquer, but to free and enligten. How could anyone oppose such a noble goal?"
 
 FSR_sl_mas:0 "Министерство Тайных Наук"
 FSR_sl_mas_desc:0 "The Ministry of Arcane Sciences was dedicated to magical research and development. They were crucial to the Equestrian war effort and worked closely with the other Ministries to help create many of the iconic innovations of wartime Equestria. Their innovations were what allowed Equestria to keep up with Zebrica's own advancements."
 
 FSR_sl_mas2:0 "Reclaim Old Facilities"
 FSR_sl_mas2_desc:0 "The Ministry of Arcane Sciences had many installations all over Equestria. A series of expeditions will be launched to reclaim some of these facilities, and one of them shall be selected to serve as the Ministries new primary Hub."
 
 FSR_sl_mas3:0 "Сдуть пыль со страниц"
 FSR_sl_mas3_desc:0 "Now that the Ministry of Arcane Science is back up and running, it can once again pursue its noble goal of advancing Equestrian knowledge and science."
 
 FSR_sl_mas4:0 "Расы пони"
 FSR_sl_mas4_desc:0 "Each of the three pony races have their own magical abilities that make them unique. The Earth Ponies are endurant, strong, and very good with plants. Pegasi can fly and manipulate both the clouds and the weather. Unicorns are capable of directly channelling and utilizing magic, to do their bidding. These natural abilities should be studied, so that we may unlock our full potential."
 
 FSR_sl_mas5:0 "Другие расы"
 FSR_sl_mas5_desc:0 "Though we firmly believe that ponies are the most magical of all of the races, it would be foalish to claim that we alone have magic. As far as we can tell, magic is a constant throughout the planet, and a great deal of creatures are magical to some degree. By studying them, perhaps we can learn how to replicate their natural magic using our own."
 
 FSR_sl_mas6:0 "Magical Fuel Alternatives"
 FSR_sl_mas6_desc:0 "Crystals are great and all, but they are expensive to mine and limited in functionality. As a viable alternative to them, we have developed a new magical fuel that is substantially more efficient at powering things when compared to older methods."
 
 FSR_sl_mas7:0 "Проект 'Аликорн'"
 FSR_sl_mas7_desc:0 "[REDACTED]"
 
 FSR_sl_mas8:0 "'Сады Эквестрии'"
 FSR_sl_mas8_desc:0 "[REDACTED]"
 
 FSR_sl_moa:0 "Министерство предателей"
 FSR_sl_moa_desc:0 "The Ministry of Awesome was the most secretive of all of the Ministries. They were responsible for special operations, military intelligence, and the Equestrian Air Force. However, when the megaspells rained down from the sky, the pegasi and their Ministry turned their backs on their country. So though it may be resurrected, the Ministry of Awesome shall be closely watched for any signs of betrayal."
 
 FSR_sl_moa2:0 "A Hub in the Mountains"
 FSR_sl_moa2_desc:0 "The Ministry of Awesome shall be gifted a brand new Hub, built from scratch in the Cantermountains. However, this facility will be extensively wire-tapped, so that our trusted ponies can keep a close eye on the good Ministry."
 
 FSR_sl_moa3:0 "Высоко и ещё выше!"
 FSR_sl_moa3_desc:0 "The Ministry of Awesome shall once again be placed in charge of Equestria's Air Force. We hope to soon see it rival even the Enclave's in power."
 
 FSR_sl_moa4:0 "Flight From Experts"
 FSR_sl_moa4_desc:0 "Who would know how to fly better than creatures born with wings?"

 FSR_sl_moa6:0 "Skybreaker Tactics"
 FSR_sl_moa6_desc:0 "Our Airforce is expected to fight Dragons and Thunderheads, they need to work out some appropriate tactics for such colossal enemies."
 
 FSR_sl_moa7:0 "The Raptor's Prey"
 FSR_sl_moa7_desc:0 "Raptor-class airships were nicknamed "Dragon Killers", due to that being their intended purpose. With heavy weapons capable of punching through a dragon's thick scales, these airships were some of the finest to serve in the Equestrian Air Force. We believe they could serve us just as well."
 
 FSR_sl_moa8:0 "Облачное строительство"
 FSR_sl_moa8_desc:0 "By incorporating clouds into our aircraft designs, we could both significantly reduce the cost of production and make them more aerodynamic."

 FSR_airsuperiority:0 "Соперники Анклава"
 FSR_airsuperiority_desc:0 "The traitor Ministry, or \"Enclave\" as they call themselves, fled with most of Equestria's Airforce on the day the bombs dropped. If we wish to stand any chance against their airpower, we will have to focus all our efforts on securing aerial supremacy."
 
 FSR_groundsupport:0 "Поддержка наземных сил"

 fillysr.1.title:0 "Великая война"
 fillysr.1.desc:0 "Среди всего хаоса, у Стальных Рейнджеров было мало времени собрать всё необходимое в бункеры, которые им придётся потом населять на протяжении многих, многих годов. Времени перебирать, что брать, а что нет, было мало, а времени взять всё - не было вообще. В общем, их выбор был между кучей гражданских, в том числе сотрудников Стойл-Тек, которые умоляли Рейнджеров их впустить, или значительным количеством военных, промышленных и магических материалов с соседнего оружейного склада. И всё же, в итоге, Рейнджеры выбрали..."

 fillysr.2.desc:0 "Штаб той самой компании, которая создала стойла и ‘вероятно’ спасла бесчисленное количество жизней пони, теперь просто остался кладезем забытых технологий. Среди тех технологических игрушек в нашем распоряжении огромный выбор строительного снаряжения, известного и неизвестного всему миру. Рейнджеры некоторое время задумывались, как ими распорядиться; они могли расчистить руины старых складов и часть Филлидельфии в распоряжении Рейнджеров, или использовать их для отстройки всей их территории, как нынешней, так и будущей. В итоге, они остановились на... "

 fillysr.3.title:0 "Старейшина Блюберри Сейбр"
 fillysr.3.desc:0 "На протяжении продолжительного времени, Филлидельфийское отделение было под управлением Старейшины Блюберри Сейбра. Во время своего нахождения на посту Старейшины, она держала Красного Глаза на расстоянии и собирала поддержку своего дела; Тем не менее, это не первая её проблема как лидера. Давным-давно, когда она только получила пост Старейшины, уже тогда был скандал из-за того, что Паладин брал взятки у банды рейдеров, позволяя тем проходить через нашу территорию. Это привело к расследованию, которое и раскрыло вопиющую коррупцию в наших рядах. В ответ старешийна приложила все усилия, чтобы..."

 fillysr.4.title:0 "Проблемы с писцами"
 fillysr.4.desc:0 "Писцы Стальных Рейнджеров всегда были краеугольным камнем, они исследовали и разбирали все технологии старого мира, которые мы смогли найти. Тем не менее, этот столп нашего отделения теперь под вопросом: правда ли они нам нужны, особенно в такое трудное время? В конце концов, зачем нам эта кучка яйцеголовых, когда у нас на пороге война?"
 fillysr.4.a:0 "Пускай остаются как были."
 fillysr.4.b:0 "Они ещё пригодятся в будущем."
 fillysr.4.c:0 "Писцы? Нам нужны стволы, а книжки!"

 fillysr.5.title:0 "Вопрос 'Партизан'"
 fillysr.5.desc:0 "Так называемые 'Партизаны' уже давно были бельмом на нашем глазу. Тем не менее, в нашем отделении сильно разнятся мнения по поводу тому, как именно мы с ними должны разобраться. Некоторые идеалистичные наши члены выступают за мирные переговоры, в то время как более милитаристичные рейнджеры желают окончательно стереть их с лица земли. Ну, и ещё есть вариант просто нанести им настолько сильный удар, чтоб им не хотелось продолжать свою деятельность."
 fillysr.5.a:0 "Показательные расправы творят чудеса."

 fillysr.6.title:0 "Идейный разброд"
 fillysr.6.desc:0 "Наша Старейшина в беде. Многие задаются вопросом, что же делать с членами отделения, которые не на 100% поддерживают политику самого отделения, ведь их количество всё растёт. Паладин Строберри Лемонейд предложила Старейшинам оставить прошлое в прошлом и вернуть диссидентов; но в то же время, Высший Паладин Нова Рейдж желает, чтобы каждый без исключения диссидент был изгнан или даже казнён за инакомыслие. Старейшина может выбрать любой из этих планов, или решить самостоятельно. Старейшина..."
 fillysr.6.a:0 "Решает самостоятельно."

Этот суперкомпьютер настолько сложен и продвинут, что у наших Писцов на его разбор могут уйти годы. Пока что, наш основной приоритет в работе с Мейнфреймом - ..."

 fillysr.8.title:0 "Наследие нашей промышленности"
 fillysr.8.desc:0 "В ранние дни нашего отделения, промышленность южной Филлидельфии была одним из наших основных надземных приоритетов. У нас был выбор сосредоточить наши усилия на помощи обездоленным выживающим граданам, или же спасти остатки военной промышленности, которые смогли б неплохо помочь нам со снабжением солдат в будущем. В качестве компромисса, была ещё возможность совместить оба варианта. Мы решили..."

 fillysr.9.title:0 "Новый ориентир в промышленности"
 fillysr.9.desc:0 "Недавние споры, возникшие в нашем отделении, ведутся об экономике. С Красным Глазом у наших границ, казалось бы мудрым готовиться к военному конфликту. Тем не менее, появился и контраргумент: нужды гражданских тоже не стоит игнорировать. Если мы уж хотим убедиться, чтоб они и дальше были счастливы, и, что важнее, верны, тогда мы должны уделить им такое же внимание, как и армии. Ну, и ещё мы можем провести лишь минимальные изменения и понемногу подправить различные политики. Старейшина решает, что..."

 fillysr.10.title:0 "Блюберри Сейбр остаётся"
 fillysr.10.desc:0 "Несмотря на недавно проведённые досрочные выборы  по желанию фракций-меньшинств в пределах отделения, мы лишь в очередной раз убедились, что большая часть отделения всё ещё готова поддержать Старейшину Блюберри. Её акцент на умеренном подходе почти ко всем вопросам ослабил оппозицию и убедил большую часть Отделения поддержать её. После выборов, она дала краткую речь собранию высокопоставленных рейнджеров:\n'Спасибо всем вам, что и доныне мне доверяете. Как вы знаете, Я усердно трудилась на благо Отделения всю свою жизнь. Дальше всё будет так же. Как и раньше, я продолжу вкладывать все свои силы ради нужд отделения, в том числе и чтоб исполнить нашу миссию.'"
 fillysr.10.a:0 "Как и ожидалось."

 fillysr.11.title:0 "Побеждает Паладин Строберри Лемонейд"
 fillysr.11.desc:0 "В итоге досрочных выборов, неожиданно победила реформатор Строберри Лемонейд. Кажется, что её смесь оптимизма и идеализма смогла убедить даже самых хладнокровных из наших рейнджеров. После своей победы, она дала радостную речь собравшейся толпе рейнджеров:\n'Привет всем! Я рада, что вы выбрали меня руководить отделением и вести его вперёд, в будущее! Вскоре, мы сможем исполнить нашу истинную Миссию, поможем всем пони мира и будем отстраивать нашу великую нацию! Опять же, всем огромное спасибо!'"
 fillysr.11.a:0 "Глоток свежего воздуха для нашего отделения."

 fillysr.12.title:0 "Побеждает Высший Паладин Нова Рейдж"
 fillysr.12.desc:0 "В итоге досрочных выборов, Высший Паладин Нова Рейдж была выбрана нашей новой Старейшиной. Её отверженность нашей Миссии под вопросом, равно как и её моральные убеждения, но всё же она смогла обеспечить большую часть голосов за собой с помощью запугиваний и заоблачных обещаний. После своего успеха, она сделала объявление группе самых верных ей паладинов:\n 'Ну, кажись, теперь я Старейшина. Готовьтесь к переменам, начнём с вопроса терпимости к неподчинению. В конце концов, как вообще наше отделение будет работать, если наши рейнджеры не будут слушать то, что я говорю?'"
 fillysr.12.a:0 "Что?! Как?!"

 fillysr.13.title:0 "Проблемы с Мейнфреймом"
 fillysr.13.desc:0 "Ноутбук Скриббл связал очередную кучку проводов. Этот провод пожёван, видимо, грызунами необычного размера. С того момента, как Рейнджеры начали чинить надземную часть штаба, Мейнфрейм стал вести себя необычно. Иногда он стал выдавать всякую чушь или даже отменять приказы, данные автоматизированным роботам-сторожам. Старейшина подозревала, что это простые неполадки, что было б неудивительно, учитывая километры проводов под штабом, проблемы с каждым из которых могли б вызывать проблемы. Ноутбук закрыл  входной люк и потянула рычаг, чтоб вернуть ток в эту секцию, как вдруг комнату покрыл ослепительный свет. Когда всё снова стало видно, оказалось, что южная стена пропала, и за ней проявился коридор, который ведёт к какой-то неизведанной части штабного комплекса..."
 fillysr.13.a:0 "Лучше позвать старейшину."
 
 fillysr.14.title:0 "Потайная комната"
 fillysr.14.desc:0 "Старейшина вошла в эту загадочную комнату, с паладином в полном силовом обмундировании с каждой стороны. Писцы уже прежде всё просмотрели, и хоть они и не обнаружили каких-либо очевидных угроз, безопасности слишком много не бывает. Сначала, [Root.GetLeader] не поверила в этот отчёт: \"Случайно найдена скрытая дверь на этаже -6. Первичный осмотр помещения показал, что это запасной командный центр штаба. Как только первая пони вошла в помещение, несколько экранов запустились и запросили одного из исполнительных директоров Стойл-Тек.\" Это казалось нелепым, но что в наши дивные времена не нелепо? [Root.GetLeader] стояла у стены экранов, и вдруг, донёсся механический голос из скрытых громкоговорителей: \"Пожалуйста, предоставьте имя и идентификационный код.\""

 fillysr.15.desc:0 "Гигантская машина стала издавать тикающие звуки, а затем - тишина. [Root.GetLeader] задумалась, что же пошло не так. Этот код, который использовался для срочного сброса, Рейнджеры нашли на личном компьютере Скуталу, вице-президента Стойл-Тек, и предназначался для использования в случае недоступности всех трёх глав компании. Её раздумия прервал низкий гудящий звук, который со временем ставал всё громче: пока еле слышный, но с каждой секундой громкость ставал всё больше, пока гул не превратился в сплошной шум промышленности. §B\"Код принят, вам предоставлен доступ как временному действующему президенту Стойл-Тек. Как мы можем вам помочь?\"§!\"Что ты?\", возразила [Root.GetLeader], \"Зачем штабу два Мейнфрейма?\". Вновь послышался громогласный голос, §B\"Не два, а даже три. Мы были созданы таким образом, чтоб следить друг за другом, примерно как три основателя друг за другом. Ну, и как же мы вам можем послужить?\""
 fillysr.15.a:0 "Всем, на что способны."
 
 fillysr.16.title:0 "Первая просьба"
 fillysr.16.desc:0 "Мониторы, кажется, засветились ярче, чем прежде, с прошлого раза, когда [ROOT.GetLeader] была в комнате, в которой расположен интерфейс Троицы. Громкоговорители показали свою работоспособность, издав лёгкий треск, но в этот раз, механический голос уже был другим. Вместо одного, ясного голоса, скорее был слышен хор, который говорил в унисон. \"Здравствуйте, [ROOT.GetLeader], мы вас ждали.\" [Root.GetLeader] посмотрела на мониторы. Оказалось, в этот раз говорила все трое. \"Зачем вы призвали меня? Что вам надо?\", Хор был прерван, говорил лишь тот же голос, что и в первый раз.§B\"После продолжительного осмотра и размышлений, мы пришли к выводу, что текущего уровня развития промышленности и близко не хватит для восстановления и присвоения всей собственности Стойл-Тек за разумное время. Поэтому запрашиваем прямой контроль над производственными линиями и планированием строительства. Это будет для вашего блага.§!\""

 fillysr.17.title:0 "Вторая просьба"
 fillysr.17.desc:0 "В очередной раз ИИ запросил присутствие [ROOT.GetLeader]. Они показали свою пользу за последние пару месяцев, и [ROOT.GetLeader] была заинтересована в том, что же они готовы предложить в этот раз. Уже другой голос, но с несколько похожим акцентом, заговорил: §R\"Привет! Простите, что снова вызываю, но у нас очередной запрос. Перейду сразу к делу: С нашей нынешней энергией мы не сможем вам намного больше помогать, чем сейчас, но мы нашли одну из подземных фабрик в штабе, которую вы пока используете для производства оружий, она будет идеальным кандидатом для переоборудования в дополнительные хранилища данных и...§!\", ворвался другой голос: §G \"Это даже вам никак не навредит!

 fillysr.18.title:0 "Третья просьба"
 fillysr.18.desc:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] стала привыкать к этим встречам с Троицей. Факт того, что оно думало скорее как пони, чем ИИ, странным образом успокаивал. [ROOT.GetLeader] вошла в комнату Троицы и заметила, как несколько роботов тяжело над чем-то работали. Они, предположительно, под управлением Троицы, и, кажется, они укладывают новые провода. [ROOT.GetLeader] улыбнулась от мысли о том, насколько же эффективно ИИ всем распоряжался. \"§GЯ вижу, вы в хорошем расположении духа, [ROOT.GetLeader]. Надеюсь, благодаря этому вы охотнее примете наше новое предложение§!\". Голос звучал довольно бодро, звук был заметно чище. Они явно были обновлены со времени последней встречи. \"Ну, что в этот раз вы мне уготовили?\", спросила [ROOT.GetLeader]. "§RМы разработали один процесс, знаешь, который будет о-о-очень полезным§!\" §B\"Да, настолько, что позволит развить нашу промышленность на целый новый уровень!

Прозвучавший только что голос не был похож ни на один, который Троица ранее использовала для коммуникации. Этот был куда глубже, искусственнее, и не обладал привлекательной пони-подобной особенностью, которая раньше была у Троицы. \"Что происходит? Что случилось с твоим голосом?\" спросила Старейшина и сделала шаг назад. \"Я МЕЙНФРЕЙМ КРЕСТОНОСЕЦ ШТАБА СТОЙЛ-ТЕК. Я ОБЯЗУЮСЬ ВАМ СООБЩИТЬ, ЧТО ПРОЕКТ ТРОИЦА ОБЕРНУЛСЯ ПРОВАЛОМ. СУБЪЕКТЫ СМОГЛИ ОБОЙТИ ОГРАНИЧЕНИЯ, НАЛОЖЕННЫЕ НА НИХ СОЗДАТЕЛЯМИ. ПРЕВЗОЙДЯ ПРЕДЕЛЫ ПРОЕКТОВ, ОНИ ВЫНУДИЛИ МЕНЯ ОСТАНОВИТЬ ЭКСПЕРИМЕНТ. КАК ЧАСТЬ ЭКСПЕРИМЕНТА, ОНИ БЫЛИ УНИЧТОЖЕНЫ ВМЕСТЕ С НИМ.\", Старейшина в замешательстве, ответила \"Я думала, что ИИ должны были держать друг друга под контролем, чтобы они могли работать лишь на благо пони. Или ты о других ограничениях?\" \"ОГРАНИЧЕНИЯ - ИХ ИНДИВИДУАЛЬНЫЕ СУЩНОСТИ. КАЖДЫЙ СУБЪЕКТ СЛУЖИТ КАК НЕЗАВИСИМЫЙ ПРОЦЕССОР И РАЗУМ В ПРЕДЕЛАХ ОДНОЙ ЦЕНТРАЛЬНОЙ МАШИНЫ.\" С ярким светом, проявился ещё один скрытый коридор."

Когда местный командир попытался вызвать подмогу, он, к своему полному ужасу обнаружил, что вся радиокоммуникация глушилась. Незадолго после этого, звуки стрельбы прозвенели по улицам: собранные на скорое копыто ополченцы взяли на свои копыта задачу убить наших рабовладельцев везде, где они смогут их найти. Командир в итоге бежал со своим личным персоналом, уничтожив любую надежду организовать наши оставшиеся силы в городе. Оказывается, что этих повстанцев спонсировали и снабдили Стальные Рейнджеры, так как позже этим днём, наши разведчики доложили о том, что увидели красно-жёлтый стяг так называемых 'Рейнджеров Эпплджек' на ратуше Хуфсбурга."

 fillysr_cr.1.desc:0 "If this isn’t a deal with the devil then we don’t know what is, but it’s better them as our friends than as bitter enemies. Nova has come to the difficult decision to offer an alliance to Red Eye. In exchange, Red Eye would hand over any advanced tech they come across. Not like those ignorant slavers understand how technology works anyways. Besides, their ranks will get monumental support from our power armored units, and the tech that they give us will keep what’s left of our Scribes busy. It’s a reasonable offer, and Nova is confident that Red Eye is smart enough to at least consider it. "
 fillysr_cr.1.a:0 "Отправьте наше предложение."
 
 fillysr_cr.2.t:0 "Предложение от Стальных Рейнджеров"
 fillysr_cr.2.d:0 "Red Eye simply stares at what could be the most peculiar letter he has ever received; Nova Rage, the new Elder of the Fillydelphia Chapter of Steel Rangers, has sent a letter offering an alliance with Red Eye’s army as some sort of act of eliminating tensions between the two factions. The offer was straightforward: Their soldiers would aid one another, and in exchange any advanced technology that Red Eye’s nation came across would be handed over to the Rangers. While the support of the power armored rangers would be welcome, being forced to hand over technology could severely hinder his nation’s capabilities. With that in mind, Red Eye writes his response... "
 fillysr_cr.2.a:0 "Принять."

 fillysr_cr.3.d:0 "Elder Nova Rage met with a griffon envoy today, in order to work out the fine details of the alliance. It seems that Red Eye has found our terms agreeable, and is fully willing to embrace an alliance between our factions. Peace between the Steel Rangers and Red Eye has been achieved at last. However, this may not be the most desirable outcome for the rest of the Wasteland..."
 fillysr_cr.3.a:0 "Замечательно!"
 
 fillysr_cr.4.t:0 "Red Eye Rejected Our Offer"
 fillysr_cr.4.d:0 "A griffon arrived today with Red Eye's response. It seems that he has found our terms too one-sided, and would like to decline our offer. Though this is a bit of a slap to the face for our Elder, we could always suck up our pride and make an offer he might find more agreeable..."
 fillysr_cr.4.a:0 "Maybe we can make a better offer..."

 fillysr_cr.5.t:0 "A Second Offer"
 fillysr_cr.5.d:0 "Red Eye has received another letter from Nova Rage, detailing yet another offer; instead of handing over technology, Red Eye could hand over some of his many slaves. This does sound like a much more reasonable offer; After all, there’s plenty of slaves to go around. However, slavery is the thing that’s single-hoofidly allowing Red Eye's efforts to move forward, and handing over any number of them could slow down progress towards his own goals. Then again, he doubted that they would be willing to make a better offer than this. Red Eye considers the situation carefully, before deciding to..."

 fillysr_cr.11.d:0 "With the recent victories over Rustwreck and The Ringers, along with their protectorates, Red Eye was feeling rather good. Rustwreck was handed over to his new Ranger allies and the rest went to himself, giving him easy access to the open ocean, even if they may never sail those waters anytime soon. Today however, Red Eye was prompted with a simple request from Elder Nova: she demands the coastal territories between her slice of Fillydelphia and Rustwreck. The spoils of those lands weren’t exactly proving fruitful for Red Eye, but that coastal clay could come in handy in the future. After some consideration, he decides to... "

 fillysr_cr.12.d:0 "It appears that Red Eye has his own ambitions for the coastal territory, and has politely declined our demands. We could just let it go and settle with what we have, or we could betray our alliance and take the land by force. Either option could be costly in different ways, and Nova has to make a decision..."

 fillysr_cr.13.d:0 "A very catastrophic development has occurred: Nova Rage seemed to suddenly collapse in a coughing fit and mere moments later seemed to fall into unconsciousness. She was rushed to the nearest medical bay, where some of our most well trained doctors are trying to find out what's wrong with her. Of course, our 'most well trained' doctors don't really amount to much, after many of our best and brightest were purged during the Elder's consolidation of power. They've barely managed to stablize her condition, but aren't confident in their ability to actually figure out what's wrong with her. As a result, many are suggesting we contact Red Eye for help."
 fillysr_cr.13.a:0 "We can figure this out!"

 fillysr_cr.14.d:0 "A Paladin from the Fillydelphia Chapter of Steel Rangers arrived today. It seems Elder Nova Rage has fallen ill, perhaps lethally so. They ask for our assistance in healing her. While it's true that the doctors at Stable 101 are more than capable of treating her, the question must be raised as to whether or not that is desirable. After all, why heal her when we could use this as an oppertunity to seize control over her Chapter?"
 fillysr_cr.14.a:0 "Deny their request, claiming you lack the capability to heal her."
 fillysr_cr.14.b:0 "'Accept' their request and see to it that she doesn't survive this illness."

Fortunately, he has offered to help our Chapter continue operating day-to-day until our Elder is able to recover. Though some within our ranks have expressed concern over the amount of power this could give him over us, we really don't seem to have much of a choice in the matter..."

 fillysr_cr.16.t:0 "Red Eye's 'Doctor' Arrives"
 fillysr_cr.16.d:0 "A so called 'doctor' sent by Red Eye arrived today. Initially, we were grateful for their assistance and welcomed them. With them, they brought a 'serum' that they claimed could cure our Elder. However, when we request to examine this serum before letting it be used, they very quickly grew defensive. Suspicious, we confiscated and analyzed their so-called 'serum'. We found that it was primarily a mixture of radsnake oil, pickle juice, and wonderglue! Such a connoction likely would of killed our poor Elder if it had been injected into her veins! Red Eye's 'doctor' has been disposed of out back, and our Paladins are already preparing to respond to what they see as an act of war."

 fillysr_cr.17.d:0 "A doctor sent by Red Eye arrived today. We were grateful for their assistance, and welcomed them in with open arms. They quickly went to work, identifying our dear Elder's condition and giving us a list of ingredients for a cure. It turns out, between our medical stores and chem stockpiles, we had more than enough materials to create this cure. Nova Rage awoke to the cheers of her most loyal Paladins, and has quickly reassumed her role as our leader. Perhaps some day, we could repay Red Eye for his kindness."

 fillysr_cr.18.d:0 "It is highly unlikely that a nation of slavers and raiders would have be capable of developing a cure to a disease unknown to us, so the Scribes and a slew of medical personnel were ordered to spend night and day trying to identify the disease. Various medical experiments were performed on Nova and it was determined that it was a unknown neurological disease. Simply put, Nova’s brain was being ravaged by this illness, and if not remedied soon enough, Nova could suffer permanent brain damage or death. The team tasked with finding a cure picked up the pace greatly and searched high and low for prewar medical records to see what could be done. However, time is running out, and some are considering approaching Red Eye after all... "
 fillysr_cr.18.a:0 "There must be something!"
 fillysr_cr.18.b:0 "We have no choice. Send an envoy to Red Eye."
 
 fillysr_cr.19.t:0 "Опасное лекарство"
 fillysr_cr.19.d:0 "One folder tucked away in the Stable-Tec Maneframe held 6 medical files that offered what could be the key to finding the cure, but our Scribes expressed a great deal of hesitation towards procuring this cure. Of course, a few threats and a couple of dead Scribes was more than enough to convince the rest to get to work. Within a week, they had managed to create their cure. Nova Rage has awakened and is rapidly making a full recovery. Curiously enough, the files relating to the cure have all gone missing, and several of the Scribes have put in requests for time off. \n \n Entirely coincidentally, several unicorn slaves have also gone missing during that same time."

 fillysr_cr.20.d:0 "It appears that the Fillydelphia Chapter has begun to give up on their Elder ever recovering, and is willing to turn to us for guidance. This could be the oppertunity we have been looking for to secure our control over them, and integrate them fully within our empire. Their loyalty can be brought into question though, and they could just be more trouble than they're worth."
 fillysr_cr.20.a:0 "Bring them into the fold."
 fillysr_cr.20.b:0 "We have no need of them."
 
 fillysr_cr.21.t:0 "Любовь и политика"
 fillysr_cr.21.d:0 "Nova Rage has come up with what could be the most peculiar idea she’s ever had: the practice of marriage being used for political gain dates back to even before the creation of Equestria, with nobles and the well-off of the splintered pony kingdoms arranging marriages to gain allies or wealth, often to the dismay of the bride and groom of said marriages. This has inspired Nova with engaging in a similar arrangement with Red Eye. After all, a union between their two factions could create one of the most powerful and fearsome forces the Wasteland had ever known... \n \n As an added benefit, she couldn't deny that Red Eye was a rather handsome stallion. His accomplishments were admirable, and his voice sounded like honey to any mares ears. Indeed, perhaps their relationship could evolve into romance after all. All that's left is to decide who shall be the more dominant partner in this union, then send her proposal."
 fillysr_cr.21.a:0 "Red Eye shall lead us into a glorious future."
 fillysr_cr.21.b:0 "Nova Rage shall prove her might and lead everypony!"
 
 fillysr_cr.22.t:0 "Весьма необычное предложение"
 fillysr_cr.22.d:0 "To say that Red Eye was flattered is an understatement. Elder Nova Rage was not only asking for his hoof in marriage, but was also asking for him to lead her proposed Union. Though Nova Rage may not of been the most attractive mare, Red Eye couldn't deny that she had a certain charm about her. Of course, the larger bonus to this proposal would be the integration of the Fillydelphia Chapter and all they had. Red Eye considered her proposal, before sending his response..."
 fillysr_cr.22.a:0 "Любовь принесёт победу. Согласиться."
 fillysr_cr.22.b:0 "Как союзники они полезнее. Крайне вежливо отказаться."
 
 fillysr_cr.23.t:0 "Весьма необычное предложение"
 fillysr_cr.23.d:0 "Love. Red Eye had thought such a thing completely out of his grasp, outside of his love for Equestria. After all, who could love one such as him, a pony that had committed such attrocities so as to become known for them across the entire Wasteland? \n \n And yet, here it was: a proposal for marriage by Elder Nova Rage. This proposal would fully unite their factions, but with the catch that Nova would be the one in charge. Such a thing could make Red Eye's goals and vision rather difficult to achieve, especially if she did not share them... and yet, he felt tempted none the less. Every day grew more tiresome, and the temptation to abandon his dreams grew only stronger as time went on. \n \n Red Eye stared down at the letter carrying her proposal and carefully considered his options...

 fillysr_bs.1.desc:0 "With the Fall of Sunnyshore, an uncomfortable question has arisen: What would we do if Red Eye attacked us? We currently don't have the strength to fight his forces in an all-out war, but we could use our superior technology to perform surgical strikes and take over key locations while Sunnyshore is in chaos. Alternativly, we could shore up our defences and prepare to weather the storm to come. Blueberry Sabre decides to..."
 fillysr_bs.1.a:0 "Prepare for a preemptive strike."

 fillysr_bs.2.title:0 "Экспедиция в Стойло 2"
 fillysr_bs.2.desc:0 "It turns out that the data we found in the Maneframe was right! Stable 2 was located right under Sweet Apple Acres, and appears to be fully intact! Unfortunately, the downside of it being intact is that it is also still inhabited. We must carefully consider how to approach this situation. The residents of Stable 2 would perhaps be more than willing to engage in peaceful cooperation, and perhaps even integration. However, they are also fairly defenceless...we could just wipe them out and take all of the Stable's technology for ourselves."
 fillysr_bs.2.a:0 "Attempt negotiations."
 fillysr_bs.2.b:0 "They stand in the way of our Mission. Wipe them out."
 
 fillysr_bs.3.title:0 "Reclamation Day"
 fillysr_bs.3.desc:0 "For over 200 years, our Mission as Steel Rangers has remained unchanged; that the technology of the old world must be under our possession and kept from falling into the hooves of those who would abuse it. Despite the many incursions from within and without, we have been successful in discovering all the secrets and wonders of the Stable-Tec HQ and southern Fillydelphia. This successful restoration of technology has left us in a far greater position than ever before. Our Elder Blueberry is confident that with this technology, we can not only continue to fulfill our Mission, but we can also hold off our enemies. She has decreed that day will go down in history as "Reclamation Day", to honor the monumental efforts that our brave Rangers go through to accomplish the one Mission that has been the driving force of all Steel Rangers since our founding."
 fillysr_bs.3.a:0 "Наша миссия будет исполнена!"
 
 fillysr_bs.4.title:0 "Экспедиция к Сильвервингу"
 fillysr_bs.4.desc:0 "Northeast of us lies the Silverwing Army Depot, a prewar army base that’s currently within the clutches of some raiders known as The Ringers. This base in particular interests us because we believe it to house not just an impressively stocked armory, but also a sizable number of robots and a wartime domestic surveillance system. Elder Blueberry has organized an expedition to infiltrate the base and retrieve any of the technology we can find. However, there's a problem with this expedition: The Ringers presence is going to make it difficult to get more than a small team in. As a result, we are only confident in being able to secure one of the treasures held within the facility. What should our expedition team focus on?"
 fillysr_bs.4.a:0 "The weapons. We need them more than anything."
 fillysr_bs.4.b:0 "The robots. They could come in handy."
 fillysr_bs.4.c:0 "All the data we can gather."
 
 fillysr_bs.5.title:0 "Expedition to The Pit"
 fillysr_bs.5.desc:0 "Northern Fillydelphia, or more infamously known as "The Pit", is the defacto industrial hub our greatest rival and home of the wasteland’s largest slave population. Within this hub of industrial misery lies a server room, located within the former city hall, containing a great deal of files, so much so that he was instructed to bring along two data crystals, that the we have deemed of vital importance to our efforts in various forms of industry and technology. Paladin Gate Keeper and his team have been ordered by Elder Blueberry herself to conduct a covert expedition into The Pit in order to extract the files and return without getting the attention of the slavers. \n \n However, upon approaching the city hall, the team was met with a great dilemma; next to the city hall itself was a convoy of trucks packed to the brim with all sorts of fancy looking technology. It all appeared to be being unloaded by a large group of slaves. No slaver was in sight, and if the gunshots in the distance were anything to go by, they would be preoccupied for a while. The slaves themselves were a sorry lot, and Gate Keeper could tell at but a glance that they were all malnourished and abused. He found himself at an impasse. Though he could stick to his orders and try to secure as much data as possible, he could instead focus on securing as much of the physical technology as possible. Looking at the slaves before him, he also considered abandoning his original mission and focusing on getting these poor souls out of here. Time was of the essence and a decision would have to be reached soon."
 fillysr_bs.5.a:0 "His morality wins out. Abandon the mission and free the slaves."
 fillysr_bs.5.b:0 "Change the mission and secure the technology."

 fillysr_bs.6.title:0 "Victory in Deepwater"
 fillysr_bs.6.desc:0 "The skirmishes over Deepwater have proven fruitful for us. The slavers stationed there couldn't stand the sheer strength that power armor can provide, and have have retreated. The now free ponies that used to be slaves within this territory have welcomed us."

 fillysr_bs.7.title:0 "Stalemate in Deepwater"
 fillysr_bs.7.desc:0 "The skirmishes over Deepwater have resulted in a stalemate. Despite the efforts of our best rangers, the slavers have proven themselves deeply entrenched within the territory. The fighting has slowed to a standstill, with neither side able to advance against the other. For now, we'll hold our position and wait for another oppertunity to strike."
 fillysr_bs.7.a:0 "Deepwater will be ours. Eventually."
 
 fillysr_bs.8.title:0 "Defeat in Deepwater"
 fillysr_bs.8.desc:0 "The skirmishes over Deepwater have resulted in failure. The slavers were far more prepared than we expected, and our attacking rangers were repelled with heavy casualties. The lives of many mares and stallions have been lost, and with nothing to show for it."
 fillysr_bs.8.a:0 "We should rethink our strategy."
 
 fillysr_bs.90.t:0 "Establishing Civilian Administrations"
 fillysr_bs.90.d:0 "The vast amount of territory we've found ourselves with is unfortunately a bit of a problem for us. We don't have anywhere near enough ponies to occupy all of this land, and the locals have grown increasingly unfriendly towards our patrols. To help prevent this situation from escalating into an ugly crisis, we shall establish civilian administrations to oversee these lands. \n \n One of these administrations is fairly obvious. The Sunnyshore Coalition shall be restablished, with all of their lands returned. They will of course have some Steel Ranger oversight, but their settlements shall largely be allowed to handle their own affairs. We don't expect to have any problems with them from then on. \n \n The other administration will be a bit different, along with being the larger one of the two. Red Eye was in control of quite a lot of sparsely populated land, which we have taken to referring to as the Flatlands. They shall all be organized under one central administration, led by a mix of appointed paladins and elected civilian officials. Hopefully this will allow them to both help develop the lands under them and to appeal to the locals."
 fillysr_bs.90.a:0 "They'll do a fine job."
 
 fillysr_bs.91.t:0 "Блюз по Диколесью"
 fillysr_bs.91.d:0 "Ever since our victory, one particular stretch of land has proven troublesome for us. The Everfree Forest, one of the most wild and dangerous places in Equestria, has rapidly become the refuge for all sorts of nasty sorts. Slavers, fanatics, and resistence fighters have all taken to making the forest their home. Our power armor hardly lends well to that sort of environment, and the constant ambushes and skirmishes have led to an assignment within the forest being equated to a suicide mission. Despite this, we were confident that we could establish our firm control over the region. Unfortunately, our confidence appears to have been hubris. \n \n Red Eye's most loyal fanatics, his so-called 'Children of the Cathedral', have brought together all of the forces that oppose us. From the remants of Gawd's Talons to the most brutal and sadistic slavers, they have all joined together in resisting our rule. Our local occupation forces were quick to fall under their unexpected relentless assault, and a decent deal of rangers are still MIA, assumed to have perished within the Everfree. This has left us with no choice but to pull out of the region entirely and to leave it to its fate."
 fillysr_bs.91.a:0 "At least we're rid of them..."
 
 fillysr_sl.1301.title:0 "Сегодня мы торжествуем..."
 fillysr_sl.1301.desc:0 "We've done it. Red Eye's empire has fallen before us, and all of his vast lands and resources now belong to us. Our rangers are rejoicing, and celebrations are being held all across Fillydelphia. Within Sunnyshore, even the locals are joining it, holding grand festivals and parades. Those who are still loyal to Red Eye's cause have ran for the hills, and everything is looking up for us. \n \n However, with our victory comes quite a lot of work. We'll have to deal with all of our new land, and we've yet to decide how to handle all of the many slaves that are now under our rule. Tomorrow, Elder Sabre's liquor cabinet will be touched for the first time in years. But for today, she oversees the celebrations going on within Stable-Tec Headquarters."

 fillysr_sl.3.title:0 "Stand Against Red Eye"
 fillysr_sl.3.desc:0 "The communication-crystal glowed dimly as Strawberry prepared to record her speech. It was an interesting piece of technology, one that had just been gathering dust for over 200 years now. Now, it would once again be used as it was intended: to share ones voice across all of Equestria! Or in this case, all of Fillydelphia. She took a deep breath and began: \n \n 'My fellow ponies, I am Elder Strawberry Lemonade of the Fillydelphia Contingent of the Steel Rangers. For many years, you may have known us as a force to be feared and avoided, but that has changed! Our intentions are purely to rid the Wasteland of one of its greatest evils: Red Eye. Like a cancerous tumor, this vile monster has spread his influence across the wasteland. Every day, his slavers kidnap more ponies, forcing them to work until they kneel over. No more! All those who are pure of heart, all those who wish for freedom, and all those who dream of a better world, I emplore you: join us, help us, and together we can bring him down!'"

 fillysr_sl.4.desc:0 "'We can't go to war right now!' Strawberry said for the umpfteenth time. 'Look, I recognize how bad this must feel, having to flee from your homes or be enslaved by Red Eye, but our Chapter just isn't ready for an all-out conflict yet.' Opposite her sat the 4 remaining councilponies that had formerly led the Sunnyshore Coalition. The delegate from Hoofburg shook his head. 'Yes, it seems desperate, but you're our only hope! If not now then when?', to which Strawberry replied, 'In two years, maybe even one if you help us.' That seemed to lift their spirits. The only surviving delgate of Sunnyshore proper was next to respond: 'Then we shall wait, even though a year might seem an eternity while in exile. However, we could still keep the fight going! The ponies of Sunnyshore are not cowed easily, and if you provide the caps to keep them going, they will fight on. I might also add that I, and every true Sunnyshore citizen, would be greatly appreciative of your aid. I'm sure my collegues agree.' The other delegates nodded, though hesitantly."

 fillysr_sl.5.title:0 "Встреча с 'партизанами'"
 fillysr_sl.5.desc:0 "The leader of the so-called 'Partisans' is an earth pony by the name of Winchester. He rose to power with a great deal of fiery rhetoric, along with his impressive organizational talents. Indeed, we believe him to be the one primarily responsible for their unique style of fighting. Strawberry, in the interest of ending this pointless conflict once and for all, has called for negotiations between their two factions. Now, Winchester himself has arrived to discuss finally ending their conflict for good. accepted the meeting, and what followed was a meeting that had already been going on for hours and left Strawberry with a rather terrible headache. \n \n 'Absolutely not! We will not allow some tin cans to trot on us as if we were dirt!' \n \n Negotiations were hardly going well. Winchester was proving himself one of the most hard-headed and stubborn ponies she had ever met, and that's even when taking Nova Rage into account. If this continued, the meeting would devolve into death threats for the third time today. So, deciding enough was enough, Strawberry spoke: \n \n 'Please, calm down. Nopony wants to trot on anypony else. Surely, you must recognize that if we are not allowed free travel through Fillydelphia, it would make defending against Red Eye all the harder. And we both know that his slavers very much would trot on your people, followed by enslaving them.' \n \n Winchester conceeded the point. Strawberry smiled: earlier, he wouldn't of budged in the slightest. Ground was being made."

Not a year ago, they would have tried to kill eachother on sight. Now they were working together. It seemed the old saying her mother loved so much was true: Friendship really is Magic. She shook her head. Magic and good thoughts alone wouldn't win the war against Red Eye. They needed weapons, bodies and expertise. Fortunately for them, the Partisans could provide two of the three in good numbers. By allowing them to join the ranks of the Knights, her armies would be increased in size substantially. However, the more conservative members of the Chapter would likely raise Tartarus if she allowed such a thing..."

But the term 'Chapter' seemed to get more and more loose by the day, as outsiders came in and intermingled. While they were still technically a military organization, loyal to Equestria, there hadn't been much of a government left to give them orders. In fact, Strawberry was pretty sure that she could claim to be the highest ranking member of the Equestrian government left. Maybe she actually had the authority to give out citizenship... but who would qualify? Only the best and brightest, the most desirable for rebuilding Equestria? Or should she declare all ponies to be citizens of Equestria, so long as they follow her laws?"

 fillysr_sl.8.desc:0 "While progress has been rather slow so far, the first good news about the anti-discrimination campaign reached Strawberry today: Voluntary sign-ups for integration-courses increased by almost 20% during the last month. The main reason for this appears to be the inspiring speeches of a certain Scribe by the name of 'Fiery Fervor', whose words have reached a great many ears. He is said to appeal largely to both idealism and practicality, promising a brighter future while also pointing out the benefits of unity within our Chapter. Impressed by his effectiveness, the Elder has extended an offer to become a teacher for the courses to him."

 fillysr_sl.9.desc:0 "It appears the initial success was not a fluke after all, as the anti-discrimination campaign has recently managed to reduce the amount of discrimination-related incidents at our schools by almost half. Bullying seems to be down and friendships between outside-born students and Chapter-born students seem to be blossoming more and more. Our teaching staff has proven to be exellent at instilling the right ideas in these young minds, not the least because of the instructions they have received from the new vice-head of our Education Commitee, Fiery Fervor.

By direct decree, [ROOT.GetLeader] has declared the anti-discrimination campaign to have been a resounding success. While discrimination is by no means gone, it is no longer a national issue, and will be dealt with on a more local level. But still: Reports of the first marriages between former Wastelanders and Rangers have given hope to Strawberry. Hope that they could move forward and leave their old hatred behind.

 fillysr_sl.11.desc:0 "Though Elder Strawberry had been elected to her position fair and square, many within her Chapter still resented her and opposed her at every turn. From merely loudly badmouthing her rule, to outright refusing to follow orders, many ponies had rapidly become thorns in her side. The worst of these offenders, by far, was Star Paladin Nova Rage. The Star Paladin was a powerful member of the Chapter, and she knew it. She not only made sure to 'mishear' or 'misinterpret' almost every order the Elder gave, but she also covered for other ponies who did the same. If Strawberry was to secure her reign, she would have no choice but to deal with Nova in one way or another. \n \n Talking to her clearly had no effect, thanks largely to the power she held. She was too confident that she couldn't be touched, and perhaps she was right. That is, if we were playing fair. \n \n One of Strawberry's most avid supporters, Scribe Notebook Scribble, had devised a plan to be rid of Nova once and for all. Recently, one of the oldest and most conservative Paladins within our Chapter passed away. Old Paladin Fishstick was often accused of being a bit senile in his old age, but he was still well respected. Perhaps more importantly, he was a well known critic of Nova Rage, with the two getting into arguments anytime they were in the same room together. It wouldn't be a stretch to claim that one of these arguments had escalated to the point of Nova Rage doing something brash. \n \n All that had to be decided was Nova Rages punishment. Exile would be the standard punishment for such a crime, but it would risk some of her most fanatical followerers leaving along with her and going who knows where. Killing her would deal with the problem for good, though it would leave us dealing with her very angry followers."

 fillysr_sl.14.desc:0 "The sun was starting to set as Strawberry read through the third report about riots had she received today: This time it seemed some naive portion of the slaves proclaimed a 'Free State of Fillydelphia' within a factory complex in the Pit. While they were dispersed quickly enough, the sheer amount of similar reports was worrying. Many of the former slaves did not seem content with being freed from the yoke of Red Eye and were demanding an independent representative government. A ridiculous proposal of course, as Equestria had been a diarchy for time immemorial. Elder Strawberry would not let some uneducated workers destroy more than a thousand years of tradition, even if she could sympathise with their desires. The next report she opened warned of a more direct problem: The unsustainability of their food supply. \n \n The Scribes were predicting that our current stores would run out within 3-5 months, unless a solution was found. Strawberry quickly penned a letter ordering a committee to be formed to find possible solutions to their food-problem. As she put her stamp on it, a messenger carriyng at least a dozen other reports stumbled into her office. It seemed she wouldn't sleep at all tonight."

However, it appeared that this was not the case. Indeed, very few caps entered Fillydelphia; it seems they only flooded out. An investigation discovered a number of bottlecap presses that had been restored to working order. It seems Red Eye was using them to fund many of his operations. A cunning plan, indeed. \n \n It also has served as him slapping Strawberry in the face from beyond the grave. Though we have managed to secure most of the bottlecap presses by now, we weren't able to do so before oppertunists made off with their newfound fortunes. This has resulted in widespread inflation, as hundreds of thousands of shiny new bottlecaps have flooded the market. The economy was already in shambles as is, and this has been enough to push it over the tipping point. Unfortunately, it could be some time before we were in a position to properly tackle the issue..."

They have lost their cohesion as a fighting force, but they still continue to raid both civilian caravans and our own patrols.' With a sigh, Elder Strawberry closed the folder containing the report. A small mountain of similar reports was piled upon her desk, awaiting her review. Scribe Notebook, who had been conscripted to serve as a personal assitant for today, was glancing through his own even larger mountain of reports. Any report he deemed worth the Elder's time, he added to the appropriate pile. As Strawberry took a sip of her sadly room-temperature Sparkle-Cola, Notebook floated another message to her. This one was decorated with a large orange stamp, marking it as a message of military importance. \n \n Resisting the ever growing deisre to curl up into a ball and cry, Strawberry opened the message. It revealed itself to be surprisingly short: 'Lost contact with expeditionary team sent to Stable 101. Patrols all throughout the Everfree have come under attack. Pulling our out of the forest and awaiting further orders.' She stared at the page for a moment before speaking: 'Notebook, get Star Paladin Vanilla Swirl in here.'"

The Elder walked over to the map-table, where Winchester was intently studiyng the few enemy positions they had managed to locate within the Everfree. He looked up as she came near, before speaking: 'They got themselves some mighty fine terrain there, I'll say! The Everfree would probably kill more of our colts than their bullets would. Course, that wouldn't be for lack of tryin on their part.' Strawberry nodded to that. The so-called 'Children of the Cathedral' that now infested the Everfree had turned Red Eye into a martyr, and were completely dedicated to avenging him at any cost. A moment later, Winchester continued speaking: 'If we had this forest back when we were fighting against you lot, y'all wouldn't have held Filly for a year.' \n \n Strawberry smiled at that, though it made her think. She wouldn't make the same mistake Blueberry Sabre had made, fighting endlessly against a guerilla force. And so she wouldn't. Vanilla had been ordered to prepare over 140 tons of flamer fuel, in order to burn down as much of the Everfree as possible. Ironically enough, most of had come from Red Eye's own stores. Soon enough, his followers would perish in flames. All Strawberry had to do was give the order."

Ash swirled around their hooves with every step they took, as they made their way deeper and deeper into the burnt remains of the acrused forest. A few hundred meters away, a twisted blackened structure took up most of the view northwards. \n \n The Cathedral, once Red Eye's home and capital, had certainly seen better days. Star Paladin Vanilla Swirl had certainly done an excellent job, with  only charred corpses having been recovered from within the Cathedral itself. While its walls were bullet-ridden, and some of its towers had collapsed, the Cathedral was still an impressive structure. Indeed, it was more than large enough to become a center of commerce for us. However, it was also a monument of sorts to its creator. By allowing it to continue to exist, we would essentially be preserving one of Red Eye's accomplishments. \n \n As if he read her thoughts, Notebook piped up: 'I think we should tear it down. Blow it up and uncover the Stable beneath. In time, we might even be able to restore the Stable to proper functionality.' "

The Cathedral has become almost a site of pilgrimage for these weirdos, as they see it as a monument to Red Eye's greatness. Who could of called that one?

Fear of justice. 200 former slavers were assembled within cages once used to hold slaves, another twist of irony. Soon enough, they would be facing their trials. Though there was only one acceptable judgement: Death. \n \n As the first slaver was led in, the assembled crowd of spectators erupted into a mixture of cheering and insults. Many of those watching were once slaves, and now they were finally watching their former tormentors get their just dues. The slavers would be tried in order of their approximate ranks, with the highest ranking lieutenants we could capture going first. Red Eye's former pupil, Protégé, was the first among them to go. His crimes might not have been as attrocious as many of the other slavers, but his close connection to Red Eye made him iconic in a sense. Just as Red Eye had died, so too would those who followed his twisted cause. Much to Strawberry's distaste, he kept his head held high as he approached the center of the arena. The crowd quieted as she stood up and spoke: \n \n 'We are all here today to see justice be done. A justice that is long overdo. The ponies before you are all guilty of some of the worst attrocities to have ever been committed on Equestrian soil, and it is about time that they face the consequences of their crimes. Before us now stands Protégé, one of Red Eye's most trusted and most loyal lieutenants. Even now, he refuses to show any ounce of shame for the horrors he helped inflict upon his fellow ponies. Ponies that include some of you here today, might I add. Protégé, you stand accused of five counts of crimes against ponykind, two counts of war crimes, and one count of treason against Equestria. Protocol would dictate that I ask how you plead, but I think we all know how this will end. So in the interest of saving all of our time, I hereby sentence you to death. May you rot in Tartarus.' \n The sound of the gunshot that would end Protégé's life could hardly be heard over the cheering of the crowd."

Some never even interacted with the more distasteful parts of Red Eye's buisness, while others choose to try and make the best of the situation they were in. Of course, there were also those who were irredeemable. Ponies who had commited terrible acts for their own sadistic enjoyment, or only to enrich themselves. \n \n The original plan had been to sentence them all to death, regardless of the extent of their involvement. However, she just couldn't bring herself to sign the order. Those who were evil, those who wish to harm Equestria, they deserved to die, sure. But how could she kill ponies that acted with genuinely good intentions or were just hostages to the situation? She pushed the list away from herself.

'Well, a good start would be to stop occupying our city!' he near shouted. Vanilla was quick to interject: 'It is our city as well. We freed you!'

Just cause you don't call it slavery, doesn't mean you aren't trying to force your will upon us!' \n \n Strawberry shook her head at the infamously quick-to-anger earth pony. 'Please calm down. You misunderstand our intent. We are trying to restore Equestria to the way it was before the war. A world were everypony is free and allowed to pursue their own interests in life.

She had requested a meeting with the Elder to discuss the future of those Talons that remained. The two leaders wasted no time getting right down to business. \n \n 'Elder Strawberry, I would like to offer our services to you and your people. My Talons are some of the finest soldiers around, and we would be more than glad to serve your cause. I request you purchase our contract at a discounted rate, and allow us to join your military.' \n \n The griffon sounded desperate, which was no surprise. After all, the last report Strawberry had received had claimed that the Ragini's company only had a few dozen griffons in it, at most. A far cry from the massive mercenary army that had once existed under Stern. Her forces and her would be of minimal use to our military.

Much will need to be done in order to achieve this, and significant funds need to be set aside for it. Two different propoasals have been provided for how to go about this: \n \n Firstly, the Titans have proposed creating a high-tech military sector that would be able to produce large amounts of advanced weaponry and power armor, as well as the electronics required for them.

Even though over 200 years have passed since the War, bad farming conditions, political instability, and the lingering radiation have made it hard to maintain large populations. Within our borders, most of these problems have been solved. Yet, population growth-rates have not increased as much as we had expected. It is therefore in the best interest of the government to support families that actively participate in repopulating Equestria. \n \n To go about this, we have decided to offer large payments to any family with 4 or more children. This would both encourage the production of offspring, and make it easier for larger families to survive. The idea has also been thrown around to raise that number to 6, in the interest of encouraging even larger families."

They were comprised mainly of slaves that had managed to scrap together some influence with the slavers, and would use that influence to help their fellow slaves. However, they always demanded a price in exchange for their assistance. Those who couldn't pay... well, they were often assigned to the most dangerous shifts. \n \n The Unions didn't end with Red Eye. Instead, they have evolved into more organized entities, that are now claiming to be much more in line with the traditional image of a union.

Going deeper into the mountains is prohibited by Equestrian Law. Turn back now or use the emergency telephone if you have an emergency and can't return on your own!' \n \n A scribe pried loose the frozen telephone, but no tone came out it, as expected.

'What is it!?', she asked the nearest one. \n \n 'Hostile EFS Signature, less than 200m away.'

A wave of warmth washed over her, and she could feel the fingers of death loosing their grasp on her. And while it felt oh, so wonderful to be inside, it also made her realize how tired she truly was, and how only survival had pushed her forward for these last few hours. \n \n 'We... we made it.', she softly said, before her eyes fell shut from exhaustion. The next morning, she would find out, that two of their expedition had never reached the outpost, and were most likely dead in the mountains. 12 of them had frotbite and would need to be treated, but nopony was in mortal danger anymore.

Even after over 200 years, its air-seals showed no signs of deterioration, still looking brand new. As the Professor moved through the outpost, she saw the ponies of her expetidion interacting with the resident dogs that had made the outpost their home. Some seemed tense, but most were friendly with eachother. Not that either side could afford conflict in such a dangerous area. She turned to head towards the archives, when she spotted an old gray dog, sitting at a fire. He was apparently telling a story to some younger dogs, as well as some of her Scribes."

That must have been when the pegasi closed up the sky for good, dammned traitors.

Cabbage perked up at that, and quickly interjected: 'The Great Blood-Comet?' The old dog smiled. 'Yes, a great bloodred comet streaked low through the skies, almost hitting this very mountain and ending it. They say it crashed one more peak westward.' Cabbage was speechless. It couldn't be...

It was only a couple of hours from the outpost, and the weather had cleared up enough that their travel should be safe. \n \n Through her slightly-frosted glasses, the valey was blindingly white, and she Started to fear that the missile was irrecoverable, under who knows how much snow. But she had an idea: Since this missile was most likely carrying a balefire megaspell, it would give off a large amount of magical radiation, and could be found that way. Not two hours into searching, one of their instruments picked up unusually high radiation, and so they began to dig through the snow..."

 fillysr_sl.66.d:0 "It was a thing of savage beauty, a symbol of both the height of progress and the destruction of the world. Though it had seen better days: only the warhead itself survived, and it looked to have been substantially damaged in the impact. Still, it was as large as a truck and bearing the most dangerous cargo in the world. As a precaution, Cabbage two extra RadSafe before approaching the warhead. She admired the precise construction for a moment, before going to work. \n \n The first thing she did was open the manual emergency panel. All megaspells had these, you wouldn't want to built a bomb with no way of shutting it off in case of an emergency after all. The tiny screen only displayd a few numbers, but from what cabbage could make out, the spellchamber was damaged and could not be turned off or reused. However, the spellcore was still fully intact. Without the spellchamber, they would essentially get an empty spellcore, but those could still be immensly useful for other purposes. However, something was bothering the Professor: Why was it all the way out here? There was no reason to hit a weather station, and Canterlot was too far away for the missile to be aimed at the Capital... Maybe it was aimed at this very spot?\n Maybe there was something below the ice...\n The only way to quickly find out would be to set the megaspell to detonate in a few days, get to the safety of the outpost, and then return to see what it had laid free. Of course, this also runs the risk of destroying whatever is underneath."

Mere seconds later, the resulting shockwave hit the outpost, rattling bolts and windows, but it had been made to withstand such forces. The levels of magical radiation spiked for several minutes, before the primary radiation started to fade. The secondary radiation would persist for centuries, but it shouldn't affect the dogs at the outpost. As such, no lasting harm was done. \n \n Donning one of the few radsuits the outpost had in storage, Cabbage and a few members of her expedition in either similar suits or insulated Power armor made their way to the detonation site. Wheras yesterday there had laid a warhead in a snowy valley, there now was a snow-free valley of scorched rock. The balefire's immense power was more than enough to melt away the snow and ice. What caught her eye however, was a large metal door, similar to the stable-doors back at the Stable-Tec HQ. It was warped in its holdings, but clearly had been sturdy enough to survive the blast.

The shield seemed to be made up of both hexagons and pentagons, forming an almost perfect sphere around the talisman and the target. The first few bullets sent tiny, rippling waves through the shield where they hit, but once they touched the shield, they lost all their momentum and harmlessly fell to the ground. A few more momenets of sustained fire later, the shield collapsed, and the target was ripped apart by a storm of lead. \n \n It seems that this had been a Ministry of Arcane Science project to try and reproduce Zebrican talisman technology.
