state_lore_text_container_state_description_19:0 "The last surviving vestige of the once iconic §YBucklyn Bridge§!, the Balefire bombs and the resulting apocalypse reduced the once mighty landmark to a lone, towering reminder of the city that once was. A near impregnable fortress, it wasn't surprising that when the §CSteel Rangers§! came to the ruins of Manehattan, they chose Bucklyn Cross as their base of operations. The Manehattan Contingent made a home out of the maintenance tunnels that snaked within and under it, barracks and workshops and labs are crammed into every available space. Knights and Initiates train on the open asphalt of the small section of road still standing, while Scribes toil away inside, cataloging and preserving every piece of technology brought back to the Cross. Below, at the water of the Mare River, the Rangers have constructed an impressive winch system, able to lift boats out of the water and deliver ponies and technology to their citadel.\n\nAt the lowest level lies §GThe Vault§!, a massive, protected area that serves to hold the entirety of the Manehattan Contingent's hoard; Water talismans, power armor, prototypes longs thought lost to the wastes, all stored within, all collecting dust in the name of \"preservation\". Perhaps even more impressively, The Vault is a post-war construction, dug out and built up by the Rangers shortly after they moved into Bucklyn Cross."
