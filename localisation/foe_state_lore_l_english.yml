state_lore_text_container_state_description_19:0 "The last surviving vestige of the once iconic §YBucklyn Bridge§!, the Balefire bombs and the resulting apocalypse reduced the once mighty landmark to a lone, towering reminder of the city that once was. A near impregnable fortress, it wasn't surprising that when the §CSteel Rangers§! came to the ruins of Manehattan, they chose Bucklyn Cross as their base of operations. The Manehattan Contingent made a home out of the maintenance tunnels that snaked within and under it, barracks and workshops and labs are crammed into every available space. Knights and Initiates train on the open asphalt of the small section of road still standing, while Scribes toil away inside, cataloging and preserving every piece of technology brought back to the Cross. Below, at the water of the Mare River, the Rangers have constructed an impressive winch system, able to lift boats out of the water and deliver ponies and technology to their citadel.\n\nAt the lowest level lies §GThe Vault§!, a massive, protected area that serves to hold the entirety of the Manehattan Contingent's hoard; Water talismans, power armor, prototypes longs thought lost to the wastes, all stored within, all collecting dust in the name of \"preservation\". Perhaps even more impressively, The Vault is a post-war construction, dug out and built up by the Rangers shortly after they moved into Bucklyn Cross."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_39:0 "Friendship City once was known as the Statue of Friendship, a shining beacon to all who passed by or went into the city of Manehattan that they were entering a place like know other. Even after the Great War came to its devastating climax with the detonation of the megaspells, the Statue of Friendship stood strong. Standing tall as a beacon of hope to all who saw it. As the years went by many ponies began to congregate towards the statue, as they viewed it as not only a beacon, but also as a suitable location for a potentially lasting settlement. A settlement that would become known as Friendship City.\n\nThe Statue of Friendship, whose body and base have started to decay with time, was patched up and turned into a municipality of various stores, homes, schools, hotels, and whatever else settlers could think of to try any turn this place into a real community. These ponies hard work would culminate over the years with Friendship City turning into one of the most well-known and safest settlements in the whole of the Equestrian wasteland."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_518:0 "Maripony was built over the original home of Equestria's Diamond Dogs, Splendid Valley, once it had been mined for all the gems. With the Maripony Research Facility having been said to be home to a variety of dangerous magical research projects headed by the Ministry of Arcane Science and Twilight Sparkle herself. However, during the last day of the Great War, Maripony suffered a direct hit from a megaspell, which caused an unimaginable amount of damage and killed all who were stationed there. \n\nAfter the Great War concluded, the facility laid quiet while many of the Diamond Dogs, who were forced from their old homes, tried to return to the tunnels under Splendid Valley. Which led to many of them being mutated into beasts, known as Hellhounds, due to the massive number of hazardous materials that were stored within the vast network of tunnels. However, this would be only the beginning of things to come, as strange new creatures began to appear around the old research facility, claiming it as their permeant home, and either kidnapped or forced away anyone who dwelled nearby. Creatures whose skill and power became feared throughout the wasteland and whose goddess dwelled within the bowels of the old laboratory."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_808:0 "§YJunction R-7§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_808:0 "Before the world was washed in Balefire, Junction R-7 was one of many railroad junctions that dotted the landscape of old Equestria. And, like most railroad junctions, it sat in the middle of nowhere, save for a nearby Shattered Hoof Reeducation Facility.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Great War and the over the subsequent years, Junction R-7 slowly grew into a makeshift community for those who found themselves working for the Shattered Hoof Raiders and their mysterious leader, Mr. Topaz. While life might seem rather abysmal in Junction R-7, many still find themselves coming to the area in order to work. The promise of security and the ability to earn some caps makes this place almost seem like a little paradise in the wasteland. Especially, if your security is a group of Talon Mercenaries who decided to set up shop in the Junction."
