state_lore_text_container_state_name_532:0 "The §YCity§! of §YSlaves§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_532:0 "§YFillydelphia§!, once the rival of Manehattan in population and industry, overtook the City That Never Sleeps during the war, being the center of Equestrian industrial output making everything from guns, tanks, and planes to toasters, cars, and TV’s. This made it a prime target for the Zebrican Balefire bombs, though it wasn't as hard-hit as Manehattan, leaving much of the city's impressive industry intact. Despite this, the city was still plagued with disease, monsters, and horrific mutations caused by the mix of pollution and balefire radiation, But this didn’t stop §RRed Eye's§! brutal conquest the city, driving out the mutants and steel rangers and wastelanders alike until he claimed the ultimate prize: the famed factories of the City of Sisterly Love\n\nToday the industrial center and much of the outskirts is under Red Eye's control, being the economic powerbase behind his slavers. Like they did 200 years ago, the smog producing factories churn out tools of war and peace alike, all of the backbreak physical labor undertaken by the thousands of slaves overseen by the cruel and vicious slavers. Love is long lost from this city and all that remains is the smell of smog and the crack of the whip."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_19:0 "The last surviving vestige of the once iconic §YBucklyn Bridge§!, the Balefire bombs and the resulting apocalypse reduced the once mighty landmark to a lone, towering reminder of the city that once was. A near impregnable fortress, it wasn't surprising that when the §CSteel Rangers§! came to the ruins of Manehattan, they chose Bucklyn Cross as their base of operations. The Manehattan Contingent made a home out of the maintenance tunnels that snaked within and under it, barracks and workshops and labs are crammed into every available space. Knights and Initiates train on the open asphalt of the small section of road still standing, while Scribes toil away inside, cataloging and preserving every piece of technology brought back to the Cross. Below, at the water of the Mare River, the Rangers have constructed an impressive winch system, able to lift boats out of the water and deliver ponies and technology to their citadel.\n\nAt the lowest level lies §GThe Vault§!, a massive, protected area that serves to hold the entirety of the Manehattan Contingent's hoard; Water talismans, power armor, prototypes longs thought lost to the wastes, all stored within, all collecting dust in the name of \"preservation\". Perhaps even more impressively, The Vault is a post-war construction, dug out and built up by the Rangers shortly after they moved into Bucklyn Cross."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_39:0 "The §YStatue§! of §YFriendship§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_39:0 "Friendship City once was known as the §YStatue of Friendship§!, a shining beacon to all who passed by or went into the city of Manehattan that they were entering a place like know other. Even after the Great War came to its devastating climax with the detonation of the megaspells, the Statue of Friendship stood strong. Standing tall as a beacon of hope to all who saw it. As the years went by many ponies began to congregate towards the statue, as they viewed it as not only a beacon, but also as a suitable location for a potentially lasting settlement. A settlement that would become known as §CFriendship City§!.\n\nThe Statue of Friendship, whose body and base have started to decay with time, was patched up and turned into a municipality of various stores, homes, schools, hotels, and whatever else settlers could think of to try any turn this place into a real community. These ponies hard work would culminate over the years with Friendship City turning into one of the most well-known and safest settlements in the whole of the Equestrian wasteland."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_593:0 "Red Eye's §YCathedral§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_593:0 "The §GEverfree forest§! is a hostile place, full of dangerous beasts and dark magic the likes of which are unmatched by the rest of Equestria. In the two centuries following the end of the world, this already wild land only grew more so, quickly gaining a reputation for being one of the deadliest locations in the Wasteland. It would only be fitting that one of the greatest monsters in Equestria was born within it. Deep within the depths of the forest stood a structure from long before the Great War. It was the site of another tragedy, a damning fight that almost plunged Equestria into eternal night. Under its ancient foundations, §YStable 101§! was built. A Stable committed to the 'earth pony way', with ingenuity its core principle. The technology at their disposal was rumored to be nothing short of astounding, with amazing advancements in the fields of cybernetics and medicine that were near unthinkable even by the end of the Great War.\n\nNow, that Stable has been given a new purpose; One bestowed upon it by §RRed Eye§!, to aid him in rebuilding a new world. The ancient ruins above it have been built upon, turned into the foundation for a much greater structure that signifies its Master's rule: §YThe Cathedral§!. A grand tower serving as the seat of power for Red Eye, from which he works on his long term plans for the Wasteland. And perhaps, within the depths of his home, he works on §rsomething even greater§!..."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_518:0 "The §YHome§! of the §YGoddess§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_518:0 "The Maripony Facility was built over the original home of Equestria's Diamond Dogs, §YSplendid Valley§!, once the valley had been mined for all it's wealth by ponykind, and the Diamond Dogs expulsed from their home. The Maripony Research Facility was rumored to be home to a variety of dangerous magical research projects headed by the §tMinistry of Arcane Science§! and §tTwilight Sparkle§! herself. During the last day of the Great War, Maripony suffered a direct hit from a megaspell, which caused unimaginable damage to the surroundings, though miraculously, Maripony survived.\n\nAfter the Great War concluded, the facility laid seemingly dead while many of the Diamond Dogs attempted to return to the tunnels under Splendid Valley. The hazardous magical and mutative §rTaint§! left over from the Ministry's experiements in the area soon caused those who returned to mutate, creating the infamous Hellhounds. However, this would be only the beginning of things to come, as strange new creatures began to appear around the old research facility, claiming it as their permeant home, and either kidnapped or forced away anyone who dwelled nearby. Creatures whose skill and power became feared throughout the wasteland and whose §rGoddess§! dwells within the bowels of the old laboratory."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_563:0 "New Appleloosa"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_563:0 "§YNew Appleloosa§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_563:0 "§YNew Appleloosa§!: the quaintest, friendliest, and safest settlement in the wasteland (also home to the finest store in the whole wasteland.) The qualities set it apart from pretty much every settlement around, especially from its sister city of §ROld Appleloosa§!, built on the remains of the old town both get their names from. Where as one is the almost picturesque vision of old Mild West town the other is a place where hundreds of ponies are moved to and from every day to feed the slave trade. New Appleloosa plays its part in this lucrative trade as well, lying near smack dab in the middle of the rail line and having some of the only §Ctrain engines§! left in the wasteland. This also means they have some of the only ponies who know how to use and maintain them. It is these things, along with being a watering station for the trains and caravans, that let the city prosper economically. Not to mention the large scrap wall surrounding the city made decades ago out of the old boxcars left rusting in their place all along the railroad tracks keeping nasty ponies and critters out. \n\nWith its position as a vital artery of trade secured and a fairly amiable attitude, the biggest threat that could ever grace the city is the jealousy its neighbors, even its southern sister city, feel about the place."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_808:0 "Junction R-7"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_808:0 "§YJunction R-7§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_808:0 "Before the world was washed in Balefire, Junction R-7 was one of many §Yrailroad junctions§! that dotted the landscape of old Equestria. And, like most junctions of it's kind, it sat in the middle of nowhere, save for the nearby §OShattered Hoof Re-Education Facility§!.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Great War and the over the subsequent years, Junction R-7 slowly grew into a makeshift community for those who found themselves working for the Shattered Hoof Raiders and their mysterious leader, §OMr. Topaz§!. While life might seem rather abysmal in Junction R-7, many still find themselves coming to the area in order to work. The promise of security and the ability to earn some caps makes this place almost seem like a little paradise in the wasteland. Especially, if your security is a group of §gTalon Mercenaries§! who decided to set up shop in the Junction."
