By 2241, the economy of NCR dominated the West Coast and coins became universal currency, used by the three big powers: NCR, Vault City and New Reno. During this time bottle caps had become worthless in these regions."
  currencycesdenarius_info: "The Denarius (silver), which bears an image of a younger Caesar on the obverse and Caesar, Joshua Graham and Calhoun on the reverse. The inscriptions are in Latin, \"Caesar Dictator\" meaning \"Dictator Caesar\" or \"Absolute Ruler Caesar\" on the front and \"Magnum Chasma\" meaning \"Great Abyss\" or \"Great Fissure\" on the back, referring to the Grand Canyon. The symbolism is simple - the denarius commemorates young Caesar's journey to the Canyon and his first victories as a dictator of the tribes."

  currencygenericcap_info: "In New California, the relative scarcity of bottle caps made them a perfect currency for Hub merchants to adopt in the 22nd century, leading to the nickname \"Hubbucks\" and \"Hubscript.\" Backed by the value of water, the Hub merchants supported bottle caps because the technology to manufacture them and paint their surfaces had been mostly lost in the Great War, which limited any counterfeiting efforts. Secondly, there are a limited number of bottle caps, which preserve their value against inflation to some degree. For similar reasons the East Coast merchants also recognize bottle caps as a currency. Their earliest recorded use by survivors originates in Appalachia as of 2106."

Indeed, our current income wasn't enough to offset our expenses and as a result, we've burned through our surplus funds too quickly. It's safe to say that we are currently suffering from [?caps_bankrupcy_deficit_stab|=%+] stability and a host of other terrible effects that have come with our horrible fiscal situation. It is absolutely imperative that we put our efforts towards solving this crisis and getting our economy back on track! If we let this issue worsen for much longer, there's truly no telling what will happen to any of us. Hell, our people could even revolt against us!"

bankrupt_events.2.d: "The fiscal crisis has finally pushed our people to the breaking point. With nothing in their pockets and with little to nothing left to lose, our people have taken to the streets and are violently protesting against us. Important infrastructure has already been damaged by rioters, and this damage is causing logistical issues in distributing important resources across our territory. Local police and security forces were having trouble keeping the peace, so we regrettably had to turn our military's power against our people in order to restore the peace. We haven't been able to quell all of the resistance yet and we're still in the processing of undoing damage across the nation, but we must urgently address our economic situation in order to prevent any further damage and bloodshed. Unless we get our country back on track, the situation can and will get much worse."

Our officers are reporting a disturbing rise in the number of incidents that are reported as desertions. In our efforts to restore the economy and domestic order, we forgot to allocate pay to our armed forces. As a result, we've got soldiers deserting at alarming rates, with their kit and all. Our fiscal situation has now made a marked impact on our national security; we truly must find a solution soon for our situation or else our country and people could be preyed upon by seditious elements within our borders or by hostile powers on our borders. We need to double down on our efforts, we absolutely cannot allow either of these to come to pass."

bankrupt_events.4.t: "We stand now, at the precipice."
bankrupt_events.4.d: "The only thing as defenseless as a sovereign nation without its own military is a sovereign nation with a weaponless military, and we're getting far too damn close to the latter. Our citizens have been protesting for a prolonged time about the allocation of what meager funds we have to maintaining our military strength, rather than providing relief to communities that have been most affected by the crisis. As an act of protest, they are dismantling the factories that supply our forces as well as staging march-outs, and our arms productions capabilities are quickly going down the drain. While our forces can probably draw on our reserve weapons stockpiles, we obviously can't do it for a prolonged period of time, let alone in a war with another nation. The only thing we can do to remedy this situation is to fix our fiscal situation, and with the utmost haste. Unless of course, we can make our enemies surrender from laughing too hard when our soldiers arrive to the battlefield wielding cutting-edge rocks."
bankrupt_events.4.a: "And we thought deserters were bad..."
bankrupt_events.5.t: "Black Tuesday has nothing on this."
bankrupt_events.5.d: "After much turmoil, bloodshed, and anguish, the absolute worst case has finally happened. Our national economy and the framework for which it operated on have utterly collapsed. There's honestly no telling what will happen as a result of this. Like a malignant tumor, rioting will spread across the nation, and anarchy, after it reigned in our streets for so long, might finally prevail over order. Our advisors grimly conclude that both of these happen at a scale incomprehensible to our limited imaginations, and our citizens will live in a fear-filled, uncertain future. Given what's happened, this is definitely a possibility for us and so many of our people. But while we're still here, we have to rebuild the economy, starting with the first brick in its foundation. In order to hopefully secure a prosperous future for future generations, we have to put everything we have into reconstruction, even if we die in the process. \n\nWe'll start again from square one...no. We'll start from square zero!"

Entire warehouses of emergency supplies, ammunition, and weaponry have been picked clean. Even the rattiest, most unreliable firearms were stolen! We suspect either deserting soldiers or dissenting citizens made off with our weaponry, but there's no way we can validate that now. If we don't get our debt under control and our economy on the right track soon, so many innocent people could get hurt, or even worse, we could have a full-blown insurrection on our hands!"

It's highly suggested that we do so; the sooner we can return to our pre-crisis state, the sooner we can have a return to normalcy and be able to put this extended nightmare behind us."

The deserters seems to have destroyed the entire stock of chem present in the armory in an act of protest, and have been raiding the countryside for money ever since."
