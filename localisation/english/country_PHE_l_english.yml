 unification.10.d:0 "Today, [PHE.GetLeader] has greeted the population of the quickly expanding Phoenix Supremacy with shocking news:\n\nThe old autocratic state is to be dissolved, and in its stead a new theocracy will rise.\nWith [PHE.GetLeader] declaring herself the §GAvatar of the Primordial Pheonix§!, and officially outlawing all other religions on penalty of death.\n\nNot only that, reports from neighbouring countries have come in, that the scant rumors about [PHE.GetName] experimenting with necromancy on a large scale have been proven devastatingly true.\nThousands, maybe tens of thousands of undead soldiers and worse abominations were paraded through the cities.\n\nTurbolent times approach the North, as there is no sign of the Pheonix Empire slowing down in it's conquests."
