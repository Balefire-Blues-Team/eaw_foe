### EVENTS ###
##############
 
 khanate.1.t:0 "Clan Tsasan"
 khanate.1.d:0 "WIP\n\nWhat was our clan at home in Yakistan like? What were our most distinct qualities?"
 khanate.1.a:0 "Our Prowess"
 khanate.1.b:0 "Our Dilligence"
 khanate.1.c:0 "Our Size"
 
 khanate.2.t:0 "Along the Polga"
 khanate.2.d:0 "WIP\n\nWhile we plundered many minor settlements on our way southwards, the bigger cities were able to pose some resistance.\n\nHow did we deal with these Cities, Intimdation or open Warfare?"
 khanate.2.a:0 "Intimidation"
 khanate.2.b:0 "SMASH!"
 
 khanate.3.t:0 "The indecisive Blow"
 khanate.3.d:0 "The two armies of the Commonwealth fought desperately to close their lines again.\nIt was no use, the Yaks had broken through their front and were bitterly fighting their way to the backlines. From all sides their forces were beset, with the reinforcements from Stratusburg and Novochernusk refusing to engage, and the Arrians having turned on their former overlords, the Commonwealth was truly doomed.\nGrimsmasher intended to make sure their fall came swiftly. Surrounded by some of his best soldiers, they were cutting a bloody swath to the top of a hill where the Royal Banners had been spotted. One of them at least, for it seemed the King and Queen of the Commonwealth were leading different parts of their desperate army.\n'THERE!' one of Grimsmashers Lieutenants shouted, pointing to a group of ponies making their way to one of the few Trucks the Commonwealth army used. Their uniforms had the Yellow trim of the Royal Guard, and so one of the Royals must be there. Grimshmasher and his Kin changed course, charging up the hill. The Royal Guard was swift to respond, shielding the Royal from the Yaks' first salvo, before returning fire, and actually managing to down some of the Yak Warriors.\nGrimsmasher ignored their fire, as he had spotted his target, Queen Falling Dusk. He let his Kin deal with the Guards, jumping their line to deal with the Queen Personally. The unicorn mare released some sort of spell, shearing armor plates off Grimsmasher's side, but it was too late. A burst from his guns tore into her side, and she fell to the ground. Grimshamsher, not breaking his charge, moved to crush her head with his hoof, though with a defiant roar, the Queen unleashed another great arc of magic, shredding his front leg. Now on three legs, Grimsmasher rose again, ready to finish the job, but the Queen's eyes were already lifeless. At the foot of the Hill, the Commonwealth forces were breaking, many fleeing, while others were cut down by Grimshasher's forces."
 khanate.3.a:0 "Victory!"
 
 khanate.4.t:0 "The Assault on Kucyków"
 khanate.4.d:0 "Grimshasher sat in his tent, one of his wives bandaging the stump where the Shaman had amputated his shredded leg. His Servants had already assured the Khan that they would send someyak to Fillydelphia with a large amount of Caps, to buy a cybernetic replacement from the Slaver-lord of the City.\nNow, Grimsmasher sat and waited, having given command of the Assault on Kucyków to his cousin Rockcrush. As displeasing as it was to sit out such a major battle, to not be able to deliver the deathblow to an enemy, he knew that he couldn't lead a charge in his state.\n\nAs the Sun began to set, the sound of an army returning filled the Warcamp. With hesitation a group of his advisors, as well as the three Pony-leaders that had betrayed the Commonwealth for him entered his tent.\nRockcrush was not among them.\nThey began to tell him of their failiure. Kucyków had held, the suburbs being ill-suited to the Yak's ususal charges, and the mighty walls raining down fire on their forces. Rockcrush had been slain in the assault, as had many of Grimsmasher's Warriors. King Purefire also seemed to have escaped the Battle at Razorfield alive.\nGrimsmasher took the news with quiet dignity, dismissing them all after they finished their reports, and ordered the alcohol-supplies of the camp to be given out to the returning warriors.\nOne of the Ponies, Dried Ink stayed behind. The former Governor of Arria assured the Khan that he had assassins in the city, and that King Purefire would be dead come the morning.\n\nDried Ink turned out to be right, but the Commonwealth was still standing even with their Monarch's death, and the Yaks would have to recover before another assault."
 khanate.4.a:0 "We Failed... for now"
 
 khanate.5.t:0 "Meeting of the Generals"
 khanate.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nGrimshmasher meets with his generals and decides on how to rebuild the army. They can either opt to keep the pure Yak-military, or begin integrating local pony forces. The latter option will be very disliked by many Yaks."
 khanate.5.a:0 "Hold to Tradition"
 khanate.5.b:0 "We will need to change"
 
 khanate.6.t:0 "Preparing for the Rematch"
 khanate.6.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Armies of the Khanate are weakened, many soldiers wounded, much equipment lost. We will enter a time of rebuilding and healing, before we embark on our next conquest. The Khan has allowed for one year of peace, before we take up arms once more." 
 khanate.6.a:0 "Soon"

 khanate.7.t:0 "This Land is Our land"
 khanate.7.d:0 "WIP\n\nNow that we are stuck in this land for the forseeable future, many of our Clan are wondering how we should live until we conquer the Commonwealth.\nOne Group advocates taking some ideas from the ponies and forming proper permanent Settlements, maybe even let those too old or young of us to take up agriculture.\nAnother group rails against these ideas, decrying them as un-yaklike and insists that we should only keep to our tent-cities, and rather forge more weapons thant bother with the pony-lifestyle."
 khanate.7.a:0 "Settlements"
 khanate.7.b:0 "Warcamps"

 khanate.8.t:0 "The Equine's place"
 khanate.8.d:0 "WIP\n\nWe now rule over a considerable population of non-yaks. They have no idea about our usual culture, and are mainly used as servants and slaves. We could either keep it like this, or make an effort to integrate those ponies more into our society. Of course, the learning would likely go both ways, as some of our Citizens might decide to adopt some of the ponies' ideas."
 khanate.8.a:0 "Live and let-live"
 khanate.8.b:0 "They are servants, no more"

 khanate.9.t:0 "Ponies in the administration"
 khanate.9.d:0 "WIP\n\nAs our grip over this hand tightens, we will need to set up a proper administration\nWe could tap into the pre-existing pool of Commonwealth officials to support our Yak-appointees, though that would bind us on a more permanent basis to the local systems.\nAlternatively, we could fill all but the most menial position with Yaks, which would certainly cement our dominance over our subjects, but also pushes the locals away."
 khanate.9.a:0 "Allow pony-administrators"
 khanate.9.b:0 "Allow only Yaks"
 
 khanate.10.t:0 "Dissolving the Gangs"
 khanate.10.d:0 "WIP\n\nNow that we have conquered Tartarus, we will have to decide on what to do with the gangs that lived in the prison.\nWe could either force them to build up our nation, and improve our settlements, or alternatively we could conscript them into the army as cannon-fodder."
 khanate.10.a:0 "Put them to work"
 khanate.10.b:0 "We need more soldiers"

khanate.11.t:0 "Khanate calls to War"
khanate.11.d:0 "WIP\nKhanate is about to go to war with the Commonwealth, now is our last chance to ask for a delay, or betray them."
khanate.11.a:0 "Let's do this"
khanate.11.b:0 "Ask for 60 more days"
khanate.11.c:0 "Attack the Khanate"

khanate.12.t:0 "Subject asks for a Delay"
khanate.12.d:0 "WIP\nOne of our subjects has asked that we delay the invasion, as they themselves are still embroiled in a war. If we accept, we'd have to wait 60 more days, but their loyalty would increase"
khanate.12.a:0 "Ignore the Request"
khanate.12.b:0 "Accept the Delay"

khanate.13.t:0 "Spoils of Victory"
khanate.13.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Commonwealth lies destroyed, its armies smashed, its ponies terrified. Now we need to decide how to proceed. Do we continue our conquest, and make this whole pathetic region kneel at our hooves, or do we take over the institutions of the Commonwealth, and settle down as a people in this prosperous land?"
khanate.13.a:0 "Continue Conquest"
khanate.13.b:0 "Allow Settlement"

khanate.14.t:0 "A vision for the Future"
khanate.14.d:0 "WIP\n\nGrimsmasher has decided that his kind should abandon their old migratory raiding ways, and instead use their recent victory to become the new, permanent rulers of the Commonwealth.\nPr-existing governments and systems can be utilized to easy the transition from Warband to Nationstate"
khanate.14.a:0 "We have much to do"

khanate.15.t:0 "A betrayal most foul"
khanate.15.d:0 "Today, Direfall stands alone.\n\nDespite our deal, despite our shared hatred for the Commonwealth, despite our oaths and our unwavering loyalty, the Khaganate has betrayed us.\nThe treacherous Grimsmasher has declared that he intends to reign as the new Monarch of the Commonwealth, and preserve many of its institutions. If we allow this to go through, it would mean the end of all our ideals, the death of every ambition we've held for so long.\nWe did not spend decades in hiding, living in caves and forests, to now fall to another tyrant, another betrayal of the so called 'civilized' peoples.\n\nWe shall push with all our might against our former ally, and with luck, and perserverance, we shall grind them to dust. In the end, their lands shall be salted, just like it shall befall the Commonwealth.\n\n§rIn Nihilus, Deus§!"
khanate.15.a:0 "We have no choice but to comply"
khanate.15.b:0 "We'll annihilate them!"

khanate.16.t:0 "A Pact, broken"
khanate.16.d:0 "What many had anticipated occured:\n[AOS.GetNameDEF] has decided to reneg on our alliance.\nIn all fairness, we did betray the pact we made with them, promising the complete and utter annihilation of the Commonwealth, and all it's institutions. However, after seeing us destroy the behemoth of the north, we did not believe them stupid enough to stand against us.\nNo matter, their armies will be smashed, their riches taken, and in the end they too will be a part of the Khaganate.\n\nThey should count themselves lucky that we have chosen this path of integration, otherwise such rebellion might have been answered with a complete culling of their people."
khanate.16.a:0 "Deal with this nusiance"

khanate.17.t:0 "The Coronation"
khanate.17.d:0 "WIP\n\nCeremony at the rebuilt royal palace. Influential merchants, collaborationist nobles and Yak generals are in attendance for the coronation of Grimsmasher.\nThe Khan demonstratively smashes the old golden crown, and takes one of blackened Steel.\nGrimsmasher is officially proclaimed Emperor of the Imperial Khanate."
khanate.17.a:0 "All hail the Emperor!"
