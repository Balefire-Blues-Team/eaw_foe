 khanate.2.a:0 "Intimidation"
 khanate.2.b:0 "SMASH!"
 
 khanate.3.t:0 "The indecisive Blow"
 khanate.3.d:0 "The two armies of the Commonwealth fought desperately to close their lines again.\nIt was no use, the Yaks had broken through their front and were bitterly fighting their way to the backlines. From all sides their forces were beset, with the reinforcements from Stratusburg and Novochernusk refusing to engage, and the Arrians having turned on their former overlords, the Commonwealth was truly doomed.\nGrimsmasher intended to make sure their fall came swiftly. Surrounded by some of his best soldiers, they were cutting a bloody swath to the top of a hill where the Royal Banners had been spotted. One of them at least, for it seemed the King and Queen of the Commonwealth were leading different parts of their desperate army.\n'THERE!' one of Grimsmashers Lieutenants shouted, pointing to a group of ponies making their way to one of the few Trucks the Commonwealth army used. Their uniforms had the Yellow trim of the Royal Guard, and so one of the Royals must be there. Grimshmasher and his Kin changed course, charging up the hill. The Royal Guard was swift to respond, shielding the Royal from the Yaks' first salvo, before returning fire, and actually managing to down some of the Yak Warriors.\nGrimsmasher ignored their fire, as he had spotted his target, Queen Falling Dusk. He let his Kin deal with the Guards, jumping their line to deal with the Queen Personally. The unicorn mare released some sort of spell, shearing armor plates off Grimsmasher's side, but it was too late. A burst from his guns tore into her side, and she fell to the ground. Grimshamsher, not breaking his charge, moved to crush her head with his hoof, though with a defiant roar, the Queen unleashed another great arc of magic, shredding his front leg. Now on three legs, Grimsmasher rose again, ready to finish the job, but the Queen's eyes were already lifeless. At the foot of the Hill, the Commonwealth forces were breaking, many fleeing, while others were cut down by Grimshasher's forces."
 khanate.3.a:0 "Victory!"
 
 khanate.4.t:0 "The Assault on Kucyków"
 khanate.4.d:0 "Grimshasher sat in his tent, one of his wives bandaging the stump where the Shaman had amputated his shredded leg. His Servants had already assured the Khan that they would send someyak to Fillydelphia with a large amount of Caps, to buy a cybernetic replacement from the Slaver-lord of the City.\nNow, Grimsmasher sat and waited, having given command of the Assault on Kucyków to his cousin Rockcrush. As displeasing as it was to sit out such a major battle, to not be able to deliver the deathblow to an enemy, he knew that he couldn't lead a charge in his state.\n\nAs the Sun began to set, the sound of an army returning filled the Warcamp. With hesitation a group of his advisors, as well as the three Pony-leaders that had betrayed the Commonwealth for him entered his tent.\nRockcrush was not among them.\nThey began to tell him of their failiure. Kucyków had held, the suburbs being ill-suited to the Yak's ususal charges, and the mighty walls raining down fire on their forces. Rockcrush had been slain in the assault, as had many of Grimsmasher's Warriors. King Purefire also seemed to have escaped the Battle at Razorfield alive.\nGrimsmasher took the news with quiet dignity, dismissing them all after they finished their reports, and ordered the alcohol-supplies of the camp to be given out to the returning warriors.\nOne of the Ponies, Dried Ink stayed behind. The former Governor of Arria assured the Khan that he had assassins in the city, and that King Purefire would be dead come the morning.\n\nDried Ink turned out to be right, but the Commonwealth was still standing even with their Monarch's death, and the Yaks would have to recover before another assault."
 khanate.4.a:0 "We Failed... for now"
 
 khanate.5.t:0 "Meeting of the Generals"
 khanate.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nGrimshmasher meets with his generals and decides on how to rebuild the army. They can either opt to keep the pure Yak-military, or begin integrating local pony forces. The latter option will be very disliked by many Yaks."
