legionary.1.t:0 "Stemming the Tide"
legionary.1.d:0 "WIP\n\nLegion forces have finally managed to dig in at chokepoints in the city, and are holding against the Novaya Rodina and the Red Stalkers. Our situation is still precarious, as we are outnumbered and usrrounded by enemies. The very ponies in the territory we now occupy often see us as enemies, and only offer the smallest amount of compliance they can get away with. This will be one hell of an uphill battle, but with faith, discipline and undying determination, we will once again prove victorious!"
legionary.1.a:0 "For the Fallen Caesar!"

legionary.2.t:0 "The Expedition requests assistance"
legionary.2.d:0 "WIP\n\nMessage from the Princessyn Expedition, pleading for us to send a crack force that'll covertly make its way into the city and support their current efforts"
legionary.2.a:0 "We can't afford that"
legionary.2.b:0 "Send a modest force"
legionary.2.c:0 "Send a large force"

legionary.3.t:0 "We are alone"
legionary.3.d:0 "WIP\n\nLegio Aurorae says they are unable to send us further support"
legionary.3.a:0 "Disappointing"

legionary.4.t:0 "Support arrives"
legionary.4.d:0 "WIP\n\nLegio Aurorae has sent us a crack team of elite volunteers that will shore us up. It's not much, but it'll help"
legionary.4.a:0 "Wonderful"

legionary.5.t:0 "Aurorae stands with us!"
legionary.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nLegio Aurorae has sent us a lot of support, nearly a full cohort worth of volunteers and some of thte best weapons in their armory."
legionary.5.a:0 "As one under the Caesar!"

legionary.6.t:0 "A question of Standards"
legionary.6.d:0 "When the 4 Legions that would land in Severyana were raised back in the homeland, the Empire had already suffered immense losses in the war. The old Legionary system, while fantastic for subjugating much of Zebrica, had proven ineffective when conducting an intercontinental war.\nThus, the 4 legions were each granted a special imperial Mandate, exempting them from certain regulations the regular Legions had to obey. Legio Aurorae was granted the Tangazo Inclusio, allowing them to source up to 50% of their recruits and reinforcements from locals, regardless of race or imperial citizenship.\nLegio Aurorae has made good use of this mandate: Despite sustainning by far the heaviest casualties in the war for Caesarushindi, or St. Petershoof as it was known back then, the Legion quickly incorporated local collaborators and converted ponies into itself, eclipsing the other Legions in size by the time of the Great Betrayal. Sadly, due to the large amount of Ponies and Zonies among their ranks, they would also prove the primary target of Zenus and his 21st Legion in the bloody purges that marked those dark months. Legio Aurorae lost a third of it's members, rendering it the smallest once again. It was a hard battle, but over the last 15 years, they have once again clawed their way back to parity. We, as the inheritors of their ideals and methods are now facing similar problems.\nHere in Princessyn we are outnumbered and surrounded, with many of our subjects regarding us with distrust. Till now, the Tangazo Inclusio had been suspended due to the ongoing war, but we should consider lifting the suspension, and finally dipping into the pool of locals for more ponypower.\nThe volunteers from other Legions are not happy with us considering reinstating the Inclusio, and favour the current state of things.\n\nA small, radical faction, mainly of Zonies from Aurorae, advocate for an expansion of the Inclusio, getting rid of the 50% limit alltogether, and opening our ranks to all races and faiths."
legionary.6.a:0 "We are doing fine without the Mandate"
legionary.6.b:0 "Let's reinstate the Inclusio"
legionary.6.c:0 "The Zonies are right, let everycreature join!"

legionary.7.t:0 "Awaken, servant of the Caesar"
legionary.7.d:0 "Commander Zirrell Fortis watched the technicians hurry around the room, laying out cables and connecting a variety of Liberator-processors to the mainframe of the Administrative AI that had for so long ruled Princessyn. The technicians had tried to explain it, but Zirrell was a soldier at heart, not familiar with the intricacies of sentient spell matrices or how different AI-nodes could play off of and influence eachother. Instead, she inspected the wall-spanning command-board with it's myriad buttons, consoles and levers, their labels covered in a thick layer of dust. She wandered over to an unassuming blue button near the right wall, one of the few that had been wiped clean. The true 'start button' her technicians had assured. The big red one in the centre was supposedly a decoy that would flood the command centre with a mixture of chlorine gas, and micro-spritebots that would disassemble gasmasks and slag the whole command-board.\nNot yet.\nThe technicians were not done, despite most of the ground being covered in multicolored cables, repurposed terminals and impromtu work stations.\nZirrell contended herself with merely observing and projecting a firm aura of authority that she hoped would motivate the technicians to work faster.\nFinally, Head-technician Zonica came over and gave the all-clear.\n\nWith the push of a single small button, the machine whirred to life, and with it the 12 Liberator-nodes that would ensure any ministry backdoors were overwritten, and absolute loyalty to the empire and the Caesar would be enshrined within the AIs priorities.\nA dozen monitors flickered with static and glitched equestrian iconography, before the gilded Laurels of the Caesar asserted their authority, filling every screen. '§cAutonomous Legate 'Kaisaryn' ready for duty, glory to the Empire!§!'\nHead technician Zonica cleared her throat '§GCommander, it might be prudent to order the AI to use its communications arrays to coordinate with our own back in Caesarushindi? I'm sure the Legio would appreciate if we shared these designs and schematics...§!'"
legionary.7.a:0 "Machine, interface with your siblings, establish a permanent link."
legionary.7.b:0 "Machine, for now you shall only serve us."

legionary.8.t:0 "The Princessyn Expedition makes contact"
legionary.8.d:0 "Good news has graced us today!\n\nOur expedition to Princessyn has been successful in seizing the administration building, and has aligned the resident AI with legionary goals.\nAlready, they have re-established permanent contact with us via the AIs communications arrays. Our own AIs have greeted their new sibling, and begun exchanging information and strategies regarding the region.\nThe first fruit of that has been an adaption of equestrian robotics schematics, that the Princessyn AI had in storage, towards our own needs.\n\nIf the Expedition continues to be this successful, maybe our 200 years of waiting are finally coming to an end, and we will soon be able to return to our conquest of Severyana!"
legionary.8.a:0 "Thank you brothers. Glory to the Caesar!"

legionary.9.t:0 "Birth of a Legion"
legionary.9.d:0 "WIP\n\nZirrell Fortis muses on the ongoing conquest of Princessyn, and how the expedition already has a larger industrial and manpower base than several of the Legions back home. The question she comes to, is if her Legion in the making should remain loyal to its progenitor and ally in Legio Aurorae, or instead assert it's own authority and independence."
legionary.9.a:0 "Legio Aurorae shall forever be our Sister-Legion!"
legionary.9.b:0 "The time has come to forge our own path."
