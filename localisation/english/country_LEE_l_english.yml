legionary.1.t:0 "Stemming the Tide"
legionary.1.d:0 "WIP\n\nLegion forces have finally managed to dig in at chokepoints in the city, and are holding against the Novaya Rodina and the Red Stalkers. Our situation is still precarious, as we are outnumbered and usrrounded by enemies. The very ponies in the territory we now occupy often see us as enemies, and only offer the smallest amount of compliance they can get away with. This will be one hell of an uphill battle, but with faith, discipline and undying determination, we will once again prove victorious!"
legionary.1.a:0 "For the Fallen Caesar!"
