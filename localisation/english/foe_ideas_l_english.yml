This has given them a considerable advantage within Neocastle, granting them a great deal of influence over the affairs of their nation.\n\nFinally, the §RMechanicum Guild§! is responsible for all specialized manufacturing.

Constantly on the verge of bankruptcy, they finally had their lucky break after securing a contract to design facilities for the Ministry of Wartime Technologies. Through this work, they were able to make a variety of connections, and rapidly began branching out. One leap of faith turned into another, and their company soon found themselves abandoning most other pursuits in favor of becoming one of Equestria's largest manufacturers of arcane-based weaponry."

company_faftools_desc:0 "§O"If you think you can do it better, we welcome you to try!"§!\n\nA subsidiary of F and F Enterprises, F and F Tools was once one of Equestria's largest industrial equipment manufacturers.
