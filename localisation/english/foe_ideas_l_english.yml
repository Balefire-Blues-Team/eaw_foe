Even in Novochernusk, they were second class citizens for a long time, but a few Years ago, this changed radically.\n\nGeneral Sudden Drop, having freshly declared her independant state, needed a solid powerbase, and most of the locals were quite hostile. She turned to the Thestrals, and elevated them in the eyes of her new law.

Where the others seek to bind the Equestrians as ruling overlords, we have come to the conclusion that the most effective way to beat a foe that outnumbers us so, is to marry them. The survival of our ideology is more important than some notion of racial purity. Even if we can't fully convince the ponies and griffons that join us to buy in, their children will grow up praising the Fallen Caesar, and being proud to serve the Zebrican Empire.\nAfter all, the strongest bonds have always been familial ones."
