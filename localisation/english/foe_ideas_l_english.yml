They are considered by many to be the most influential of the Guilds, though they are still forced to share power with the other two.\n\n§GThe Miner's Guild§! oversees all of the nation's natural resources and scavenging operations. Water, electricity, and metals are all strictly controlled by them, forcing the other Guilds to remain reliant on their good graces. This has given them a considerable advantage within Neocastle, granting them a great deal of influence over the affairs of their nation.\n\nFinally, the §RMechanicum Guild§! is responsible for all specialized manufacturing.

 ROK_the_moving_stones_desc:0 "A peculiar thing happens in these lands when no-one is watching: The rocks move by themselves! Nopony has ever seen them do it, but if you take your eyes of them for too long, they change position. Sometimes they also multiply, which has enabled a strange form of geoculture: Rock-farming. Sadly, these moving rocks regularly destroy roads and railways."

 PBN_splinter_gangs:0 "Splinter-Gangs"
 PBN_splinter_gangs_desc:0 "When we conquered this region, we were mighty and unified, but not long after our success, we splintered apart.

 LRA_old_blood_new_ideas_desc:0 "While we may have been founded by escaped serfs, over the years many miscreants and criminals from the region have made their home within our territory.

All of them may be horrifically mutated, but as if by some dark design, these mutations almost always have some utility in combat.

Even in Novochernusk, they were second class citizens for a long time, but a few Years ago, this changed radically.\n\nGeneral Sudden Drop, having freshly declared her independant state, needed a solid powerbase, and most of the locals were quite hostile. She turned to the Thestrals, and elevated them in the eyes of her new law. Now, the Thestrals are slowly supplanting the existing middle-class, as frequent government crackdowns disenfranchise the existing one."
