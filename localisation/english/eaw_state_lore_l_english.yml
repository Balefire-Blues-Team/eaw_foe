state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_21:0 "Tenpony Tower"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_21:0 "§tConfluence§! of §tSecrets§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_21:0 "Despite the thrashing it received, the city of §YManehattan§!, the old City that Never Sleeps, never truly lost its glamor. When bombs rained and megaspells shattered the megalopolis's strength, there was one building that stood the trial and weathered the storm. One last beacon of the Old World that refused to back down and die. A single, strong tower that cut into the §7balefire winter§! that followed.\n\nBefore the bombs, §CTenpony Tower§! was a hub for the §tMinistry of Arcane Sciences§! in Manehattan, a place where §tTwilight Sparkle§! frequented in her various trips around Equestria and her ministry's hubs to check up on their progress in advanced research. Tenpony was special. Not only was it the home of one of her hubs, but it also housed tens of thousands of tomes that were given to her by her friend, §0Rarity§!, to preserve the literature and knowledge so that the §YMinistry of Image§! could never eternally taint Equestria's societal zeitgeist from the truth in books.\n\nHowever, that day of revelation never came, as the §7balefire§! poured down upon Equestria, and consumed life within it in purifying, necromantic fire. But the zebras didn't account for Twilight's own prowess and predictions. While it was not perfectly preserved, Tenpony survived a hit from a §7balefire bomb§! solely thanks to the wards and spells cast upon it in just such a potentiality. Its facade, a once ornate, marble exterior, has since crumbled and succumbed to the ravages of the Wasteland, but the vibrancy within has lasted.\n\nSurvivors of the §RLast Day§!, many employees of MAS, soon realized their position and fortified the tower. In hardly any time at all, the only way into it was through the reinforced gates built upon the §YCelestia Line§!, the monorail that once serviced it and endured thousands of trundling hooves each day. In time, a society of arrogance and superiority settled upon it, as in their gilded cage, the ponies of Tenpony Tower watched the world go by, and repelled any attempts at assailing them thanks to the grit of its citizens, and perhaps the occasional assistance from mysterious forces within the complex.\n\nThat is not to say that the ponies inside are unreasonable. As the tower is an ancient beast, it must constantly be maintained, protected, repaired, and restored. While the shimmering entryway or the sparkling shopping complexes are like a time travel spell to the past, it does not come without heavy work. Anypony willing to prove themselves capable can apply for citizenship, but they must always be useful to the tower. It has no patience for the permanently injured, the lazy, or the malcontent.\n\nIf one were to obtain entrance, one would encounter one of the most pre-war like living situations that the Wasteland can provide. Along with the aforementioned points of interest, the tower contains multiple guest houses, including the luxury suites of Goldentail, as well as restaurants that provide a truly Equestrian experience. For those lucky enough, they might get to see some of the workings of the radio studio that is on the top floor of the tower. However, meeting the famed §6DJ-P0N3§! is unlikely, as he is too busy with bringing his own little light to the Wasteland.\n\nAdditionally, one could rest assured that the dangers to Tenpony would be unlikely to succeed in breaching the tower. Its security force is top notch, and while the roving bands of raiders, ghouls, and even Steel Rangers may bluster and threaten in futility, the guards ponies and citizens of Tenpony Tower will ensure that the tower will stand. As the last beacon of civility and etiquette in the Wasteland, it must endure. No matter the cost."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_515:0 "The §YCity§! of §YLight§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_515:0 "Before the war, Light was nothing more than a §Ypower plant§! tucked away in the hills east of Fillydelphia, providing electricity to the City of Sisterly Love. As those not killed outright from the Balefire Bombs or the subsequent fallout fled the city, many came to settle around the still functional plant, laying the foundation for what would become Light. Over the 200 years since then, Light has blossomed into a proper city of it's own, using the ancient generator systems to power the thousands of twinkling lights that give it it's name, casting a great glow across the hills when night falls.\n\nLight truly came into it's own under the decades long tenure of §CMayor Pokey Posey§!, who solidified Light's control over the surrounding countryside via less than savory tactics. Mayor Posey voluntarily left office at the ripe age of 97, and ushered in the current democratic system that Light uses today. In the years preceding §RRed Eye's§! brutal conquest of Fillydelphia, Light grew rich off of trade with the ponies living in the ruins of the city, including the local Steel Ranger contingent. Despite it's previous prosperity, its potential has been squandered by a string of ineffective, incompetent, or downright corrupt mayors."
