  #Opening Tree
  MWY_noble_origins:0 "Noble Origins"
  MWY_noble_origins_desc:0 "We are the heirs of Equestria's greatest ponies: the Nobility. Though the seat of nobility was once the grand city of Canterlot, our ancestors made their way to Mareway over 200 years ago."

  MWY_matter_of_serfs:0 "The Matter of the Peasantry"
  MWY_matter_of_serfs_desc:0 "Peasants, peons, serfs. There are many names for the disenfranchised masses of New Mareway. For the past two centuries, their status has remained unchanged, but the young Queen has a different vision..."

  MWY_the_tragedy:0 "The Tragedy"
  MWY_the_tragedy_desc:0 "Fifteen years ago, Baroness Golden Star launched a bloodthirsty coup against her sister, Queen Silver Star. Though she was ousted by a counter-coup, the mare now known as Blood Mane has been a thorn in our side ever since."

  MWY_alarms_raised:0 "Alarms Raised"
  MWY_alarms_raised_desc:0 "Our knights have grown stagnant all while our hated enemy grows stronger by the day. Without a wake-up call, New Mareway is doomed."

  MWY_feast_aftermath:0 "Aftermath of the Feast"
  MWY_feast_aftermath_desc:0 "Already, the attack on the Hearts and Hooves Day feast has been called the greatest tragedy since Blood Mane's coup. Suspicions are at an all time high, and calls for the death of the as of unknown perpetrators ring loudly."

  MWY_privy_council:0 "Call the Privy Council"
  MWY_privy_council_desc:0 "Composed of the realm's most powerful ponies, the privy council is needed more than ever to advise and administer New Mareway."

  MWY_new_management:0 "Under New Management"
  MWY_new_management_desc:0 "With Duke Littleward's untimely death, and no heirs to pass his holdings onto, control of the Grainlands has fallen to Count Bright Glow, and as the Queen, we are expected to attend his ducal coronation."

  MWY_serfs_hungry:0 "Plight of the Hungry"
  MWY_serfs_hungry_desc:0 "A few lackluster harvests, minor mismanagement by nobles, and the ever growing population has compounded into a looming disaster. If we don't act quickly, we may end up facing a widespread famine among the peasants."

  MWY_winter_prep:0 "Winter Preparations"
  MWY_winter_prep_desc:0 "In addition to an already looming famine, the past few winters have been particularly harsh, impacting the food crisis even further."

  MWY_let_them_eat_cake:0 "Let Them Eat Snack Cakes"
  MWY_let_them_eat_cake_desc:0 "The Shatterhorn citadel is perhaps the greatest fortification ever constructed in New Mareway. It is also known for being perhaps the worst place to be a serf, and cries against the tyranny of the lords of Shatterhorn only grow louder..."

  MWY_not_a_child:0 "No Longer a Child"
  MWY_not_a_child_desc:0 "The other nobles see the Queen as nothing more than a naive child, a stepping stone to further their own interests, but Star Gazer will prove herself to be anything but."

  MWY_friends_and_foes:0 "Discerning Friends from Foes"
  MWY_friends_and_foes_desc:0 "Despite their lavish lifestyle and smile-and-wave demeanor, the nobility of New Mareway are little more than a vicious den of vipers, ready to tear us apart at the first sign of weakness. None of them should ever be fully trusted, but we must determine which of them will serve our goals as friends, and which of them will not."

  MWY_backroom_squabbles:0 "Backroom Squabbles"
  MWY_backroom_squabbles_desc:0 "The affairs of state are a devious, tit-for-tat game of cat and mouse, even between supposed friends and allies. Unfortunately, the Queen has a shortage of those among the privy council, so to get things done, she's going to have to play the game another way..."

  MWY_stay_the_course:0 "Stay the Course"
  MWY_stay_the_course_desc:0 "Reason has won the day! The reformer Queen has seen the error of her ways, resolving to continue New Mareway down the path that has kept it safe for 200 years."

  MWY_queens_way:0 "The Queen's Way"
  MWY_queens_way_desc:0 "Without reform, Mareway will be swallowed up, be it by the greed of the nobility, the anger of the serfs, or outside forces. To survive, we must look to the past, to uphold the true values of old Equestria: Friendship and Harmony."


  #Queen's Way Tree
  MWY_qw_new_path:0 "A New Path"
  MWY_qw_new_path_desc:0 "Had we continued down that old road, New Mareway would have been just like everywhere else in the wasteland; Never improving, stagnant and rotting. It's up to us to save Mareway from itself, and be the change we wish to see in the world."

  MWY_qw_strongwing_plan:0 "Strongwing's Plan"
  MWY_qw_strongwing_plan_desc:0 "Nimbus Strongwing is loyal to the realm above all, and for years he has tried to draw attention to what he believes the greatest threat to Mareway is: Blood Mane and her army. He claims we are woefully underprepared for any major conflict with the Bloody Army, and our odds of success are low. Thankfully, he has put forward a comprehensive plan on how we can prepare ourselves."

  MWY_qw_gatormaw_exp:0 "Gatormaw's Experience"
  MWY_qw_gatormaw_exp_desc:0 "Hoof Gatormaw is perhaps the least noble noble in the entire realm; Some would go so far as to call him a barbarian, but never to his face. His personal combat experience in the wasteland is second to none in our realm, and his opinion on matters of the army should be treated with respect."

  MWY_qw_peninsula_invest:0 "Investments in the Peninsula"
  MWY_qw_peninsula_invest_desc:0 "The Mareway Peninsula is isolated and underdeveloped compared to the rest of the realm, and has great potential. It's long coastline and excellent natural harbors make it the perfect spot to invest in a naval industry."

  MWY_qw_gulf_fleet:0 "Eclipse Gulf Fleet"
  MWY_qw_gulf_fleet_desc:0 "Mareway's navy should be the pride of the Gulf! Large flotillas and ships approaching pre-war sizes is the only way to rule the waves."

  MWY_qw_river_fleet:0 "River Fleet"
  MWY_qw_river_fleet_desc:0 "Mareway is split between two rivers, the wide Mareway River, and the mighty Azureway. Control of both of these rivers is paramount to Mareway's continued survival, so a fleet of smaller, more manuverable ships is needed."

  MWY_qw_merchant_marines:0 "Expand the Merchant Marines"
  MWY_qw_merchant_marines_desc:0 "Piracy and disruption of trade is rampant in the Equestrian Wasteland, and we should do our best to protect our merchants from harm. Expanding retinue service to include a tour in the merchant marines should do the trick."

  MWY_qw_naval_academy:0 "Royal Naval Academy"
  MWY_qw_naval_academy_desc:0 "Civilization and nobility is what sets New Mareway apart from the rest of the wasteland, so why shouldn't the captains of our navy show the same level of nobility?"

  MWY_qw_river_watch:0 "Keeping Watch on the River"
  MWY_qw_river_watch_desc:0 "The Mareway River narrows considerably just beyond Maredia, allowing for an entire army to ford it with ease if they so desired. Unfortunately, there happens to be an army who desires to cross it, so adequate defenses are necessary along the river."

  MWY_qw_learning_from_loss:0 "Learning from Our Losses"
  MWY_qw_learning_from_loss_desc:0 "Blood Mane's short but brutal insurrection left many of our best knights dead, and many more unfit for combat. Though Sir Strongwing led the fight against Blood Mane herself, it was Duke Gatormaw who spent the most time cleaning up any trace of the rebellion left in New Mareway."

  MWY_qw_no_incompetence:0 "Pruning Out Incompetence"
  MWY_qw_no_incompetence_desc:0 "Though it has long been tradition for Nobles to lead their household retinue and serf levies into battle, the fact of the matter is that most of the nobles are downright incompetent military leaders, and often do more harm than good."

  MWY_qw_modern_weapons:0 "Modern Weapons for a Modern Mareway"
  MWY_qw_modern_weapons_desc:0 "Many knights still wield crude weaponry that would be considered antiquated even before the war, and most peasants eligible for levy service provide their own weapons, which often ends up being nothing more than farming equipment. This is unacceptable."

  MWY_qw_fresh_pov:0 "A Fresh Point of View"
  MWY_qw_fresh_pov_desc:0 "True improvement can never come from within, the knights are too set in their ways and the nobles too incompetent to know better. An outside opinion is needed to truly bring Mareway's Army to the next level."

  MWY_qw_knights_to_officers:0 "From Knights to Officers"
  MWY_qw_knights_to_officers_desc:0 "Our knights are highly trained and experienced combatants and leaders, so it makes sense to convert their role from leaders of peasant levies to officers in our reorganized army."

  MWY_qw_away_from_tradition:0 "Moving Away from Tradition"
  MWY_qw_away_from_tradition_desc:0 "The Retinue system has worked well for 200 years, when the biggest threat to New Mareway was minor raider bands and insignificant serf revolts. However, in the age where empires and republics field army sizes unheard of since the Great War, the comparatively tiny royal retinue is nothing but a drop in the pond."

  MWY_qw_vetting_levy_system:0 "Vetting the Levy System"
  MWY_qw_vetting_levy_system_desc:0 "Serf levies allow New Mareway to raise an large number of armed, if under-trained, troops in an extraordinary short period of time. Levy dodging is rampant, and many nobles can only guess at how many serfs are actually eligible to serve. If we are to survive, the levies must be properly vetted, trained, and armed."

  MWY_qw_heavy_industry:0 "Bring Back Heavy Industry"
  MWY_qw_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Though Mareway was never as much of a center of industry as Fillydelphia or Manehattan, it still hosted many pre-war factories, which have since been left abandoned or converted into something more useful to the wastelanders of the past two centuries. With a few spare parts and some elbow grease, these factories can be brought back to their former glory."

  MWY_qw_grand_tour:0 "The Grand Tour"
  MWY_qw_grand_tour_desc:0 "With railroads connecting every duchy in the realm, and factories to produce new parts for trains, a proper test is in order. What better than a royal tour of the realm by luxury train?"

  MWY_qw_fighting_famine:0 "Fighting Famine"
  MWY_qw_fighting_famine_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to keep all the serfs fed, the simply massive population of the realm is too much for our antiquated agriculture to handle. We must find new sources of food, be it scavenging pre-war locations or expanding trade."

  MWY_qw_society_of_giving:0 "The Royal Society of Giving"
  MWY_qw_society_of_giving_desc:0 "The Nobles have accumulated vast stores of food that they frankly don't need. Unfortunately none of them want to give it away out of the kindness of their heart, so why don't we appeal to their vanity and make giving away food a way to look better in society?"

  MWY_qw_land_reform:0 "Comprehensive Land Reform"
  MWY_qw_land_reform_desc:0 "Much of the realm's potential is squandered by arcane land rights and ownership agreements, some land goes completely unused, and there have even been cases of land still legally belonging to deceased nobles. The crown must take an active role in reforming land ownership in order to improve efficiency."

  MWY_qw_centralization_push:0 "The Push for Centralization"
  MWY_qw_centralization_push_desc:0 "The glaring flaw with our push for reform is that most of the realm is simply too detached from the rule of the crown for our actions to have any real effect. We must bring the duchies and counts into line, though they will certainly oppose us at every turn."

  MWY_qw_steward_deal:0 "A Deal with the Steward"
  MWY_qw_steward_deal_desc:0 "Sometimes, compromise is the only way forward. Call it bribery or just making a good deal, the Steward of the realm has much way with other nobles, and their vote in favor of centralization would be key to our success."

  MWY_qw_dirt_on_glow:0 "Dirt on Duke Glow"
  MWY_qw_dirt_on_glow_desc:0 "Bright Glow is the epitome of what's wrong with Mareway's nobility, and has fought against any and all attempt at further centralizing the crown's rule. Thankfully for us, he is also a deeply flawed pony, and if some of those flaws were to get out to the public..."

  MWY_qw_pulling_the_rug:0 "Pulling the Rug"
  MWY_qw_pulling_the_rug_desc:0 "The Duchies have for too long enjoyed almost complete autonomy to rule themselves how they see fit, which has lead to extreme abuses of power and general disunity within the realm. Not a day longer shall this be allowed to continue."

  MWY_qw_four_year_plan:0 "A Four-Year Plan"
  MWY_qw_four_year_plan_desc:0 "New Mareway's industry must be caught up to modern standards, and although this can't happen overnight, it's best to have a structured plan on how to achieve it."

  MWY_qw_county_loyalty:0 "Cementing County Loyalty"
  MWY_qw_county_loyalty_desc:0 "It has been said that without the support of the dukes, the Queen has no power. However, the same can be said that without the support of the counts, the dukes have no power."

  MWY_qw_connect_nation:0 "Connect the Nation"
  MWY_qw_connect_nation_desc:0 "Railroads used to stretch all across Equestria, and the rusted wrecks of these steel arteries can still be found across New Mareway. A realm cannot be truly centralized if it doesn't have an adequate method of transporting messages, material, and ponies, so it's high time we brought the railroads back."

  MWY_qw_florabama:0 "Friends in Low Places"
  MWY_qw_florabama_desc:0 "The serfs are the real foundation of power in New Mareway, without them, the Nobles would starve and wither. Star Gazer's reforms have made her perhaps the most popular Queen in the history of New Mareway."

  MWY_qw_paradigm_shift:0 "A Paradigm Shift"
  MWY_qw_paradigm_shift_desc:0 "Organized and united, the New Mareway of today is a far cry from it's autonomous roots, resembling the Equestria of old more than a wasteland nation."

  MWY_qw_open_court:0 "Open the Court to All"
  MWY_qw_open_court_desc:0 "Currently, the royal court is only open to various nobles and knights, serfs have no way of expressing their needs or gratitude to the crown. If we were to open the court to all, the realm would surely benefit."

  MWY_qw_speak_with_spymaster:0 "Speak with the Spymaster"
  MWY_qw_speak_with_spymaster_desc:0 "While the Spymaster of the realm might not be the most glorious or honorable position in court, it is perhaps the most important. The spymaster holds the ear of the crown, and their support in reforming the country is much needed."

  MWY_qw_effects_of_shatterhorn:0 "The Effects of Shatterhorn"
  MWY_qw_effects_of_shatterhorn_desc:0 "The Shatterhorn Rebellion sent shockwaves through the nobility; Never before had a serf rebellion managed to take a noble's house, much less one as fortified as Shatterhorn. We can use this fear to our advantage in court, and may be able to convince some nobles to support reform so there will never be another Shatterhorn."

  MWY_qw_declaration_of_rights:0 "The Declaration of Rights"
  MWY_qw_declaration_of_rights_desc:0 "There is apparently some debate about what rights the serfs have and what rights they have not. This injustice cannot stand. Every noble house will be sent a copy of the newly penned Declaration of Rights, so there can be no confusion any longer."

  MWY_qw_grainlands_invest:0 "Grainlands Investments"
  MWY_qw_grainlands_invest_desc:0 "The Grainlands, as the name suggests, is the breadbasket of New Mareway, though it faces the issue of being almost entirely focused on farms. Some investments in industry to support the agriculture would aid the realm greatly."

  MWY_qw_amethyst_invest:0 "Amethyst Basin Investments"
  MWY_qw_amethyst_invest_desc:0 "The ponies of the Duchy of the Amethyst Basin are a dedicated, hard-working folk, with land full of rare resources. It would be wise to foster their spirit with some investments into heavier industry."

  MWY_qw_old_farms:0 "Old Equestrian Farms"
  MWY_qw_old_farms_desc:0 "The few agricultural records that have been recovered from before the wasteland paint a stunning picture of incredibly efficient and productive farms, so attempting to replicate pre-war farming methods should surely aid us."

  MWY_qw_gem_guild:0 "Fund the Gem Cutters Guild"
  MWY_qw_gem_guild_desc:0 "The Gem Cutters Guild of the Amethyst Basin can trace it's roots all the way back to pre-war jewelers that were attracted to the stunning purple gems that gives the basin it's name. Their craft has only continued to be honed, and they produce some of the finest magical gems in the Equestrian Wasteland."

  MWY_qw_cutie_marks:0 "Embrace Cutie Marks"
  MWY_qw_cutie_marks_desc:0 "Allowing ponies to pursue their Cutie Marks have long been forgoed in wasteland, as survival has always been more important. However, New Mareway is a step above the rabble of the wasteland. Our ponies should be free to pursue what they are destined to do, rather than being stuck as a guard or farmer."

  MWY_qw_development_council:0 "Mareway Development Council"
  MWY_qw_development_council_desc:0 "Much of New Mareway remains underdeveloped and unused. We should assemble a group of the best minds of the realm and set out to solve this issue. The Mareway Development Council will be given carte blanche to pursue projects that will further the growth of the realm."

  MWY_qw_merchant_class:0 "The Fourth Class"
  MWY_qw_merchant_class_desc:0 "Though small, there is a growing middle class in New Mareway. Primarily found in the city itself, these merchants and artisans produce and supply most of what allows the nobility and knights to lead more lavish lifestyles."

  MWY_qw_economic_freedom:0 "Work Where You Want"
  MWY_qw_economic_freedom_desc:0 "Serfs should not be condemned to a lifetime of backbreaking menial labor in the fields or as a servant in a noble house. By allowing each and every serf to determine what they wish to work on, it is one step closer to complete liberation."

  MWY_qw_peninsula_project:0 "Project Night Lights"
  MWY_qw_peninsula_project_desc:0 "New Mareway's nights are lit only by candle and lantern, with few electric or magical lights. By harnessing the power of the two rivers that border the Peninsula, the Development Council aims to bring reliable electricity to the royal city."

  MWY_qw_amethyst_project:0 "Project Crystal Clear"
  MWY_qw_amethyst_project_desc:0 "Our histories teach us that disputes of gems and coal is what led to the destruction of the old world. While we may not have any coal, New Mareway is one of the few places left in the wasteland with a plentiful supply of magical gems, and the Development Council aims to turn us into a major producer once more."

  MWY_qw_old_world_knowledge:0 "Old World Knowledge"
  MWY_qw_old_world_knowledge_desc:0 "The libraries of the nobles are chock full of books from the old world, as is the ruins of Mareway itself. The secrets of old Equestria are here, we just have to find them."

  MWY_qw_neocastle_tools:0 "Buying Tools From Neocastle"
  MWY_qw_neocastle_tools_desc:0 "Although Neocastle has not reformed itself as we have, we cannot deny they are better equipped and researched than us. Thankfully, they are willing to grant us their knowledge, for a price of course."

  MWY_qw_modern_construction:0 "Modern Construction"
  MWY_qw_modern_construction_desc:0 "The Equestria of old was able to build towering skyscrapers and sprawling complexes, while Mareway is still stuck building stone fortifications and shacks from reclaimed materials. It's time to change that."

  MWY_qw_queen_of_the_people:0 "Emancipation Day"
  MWY_qw_queen_of_the_people_desc:0 "No longer will the abhorrent institution of serfdom stain our great realm! From this day forth, all Serfs in New Mareway are free from any contract or servitude to anyone, be it noble or knight."

  MWY_qw_magic_of_friendship:0 "The Magic of Friendship"
  MWY_qw_magic_of_friendship_desc:0 "The royal library contains a great deal of books from before the war, many of which once resided in Canterlot itself! Who knows what wisdom could be gained from these books..."

  MWY_qw_forgiveness:0 "§PForgiveness§!"
  MWY_qw_forgiveness_desc:0 "Golden Star, Blood Mane, my cousin. She is misguided and has hurt many ponies, yes, but that doesn't mean that she isn't deserving of love and forgiveness, so that the realm can finally be whole again."

  #Stay the Course
  MWY_sc_pragmatism_not_optimism:0 "Pragmatism, not Optimism"
  MWY_sc_pragmatism_not_optimism_desc:0 "Despite my hopes, now is not the time for reform. The wasteland is more dangerous and volatile than ever, and we must be united as a realm if New Mareway is to survive the oncoming storm."

  MWY_sc_soldiers_of_fortune:0 "Soldiers of Fortune"
  MWY_sc_soldiers_of_fortune_desc:0 "The griffon Talon Mercenaries have proven themselves to be a highly effective force in other nations, so why not hire a company for ourselves? Their services will be greatly needed in the coming years."

  MWY_sc_expand_levy_service:0 "Extend Levy Service"
  MWY_sc_expand_levy_service_desc:0 "As it stands, the Serf Levy is simply too limited to be of any real help in a full scale conflict. Extending the age limits and waiving a few other extraneous requirements will do well to squeeze more out of the levies."

  MWY_sc_coastal_strongholds:0 "Coast Strongholds"
  MWY_sc_coastal_strongholds_desc:0 "The Royal Family happens to own a number of sizable land holdings that sit on the coast, mostly having been used as vacation homes for past monarchs. Without upsetting the status quo of other Nobles, we could convert those holdings to naval strongholds."

  MWY_sc_naval_modernization:0 "A Grand Navy"
  MWY_sc_naval_modernization_desc:0 "Our prosperity allows us to focus on growing our navy into the star of the waves, projecting the influence of the crown far beyond the realm."

  MWY_sc_gulf_fleet:0 "Gulf Armada"
  MWY_sc_gulf_fleet_desc:0 "Our navy would best be served in the Eclipse Gulf, protecting our interests all the way from New Mareway to Dappleshore."

  MWY_sc_river_fleet:0 "River Flotilla"
  MWY_sc_river_fleet_desc:0 "Control of the Azureway and Mareway rivers is paramount to the defense of the realm, so it is only wise to dedicate the navy to preforming well in the rivers."

  MWY_sc_end_ducal_generalship:0 "End Ducal Generalship"
  MWY_sc_end_ducal_generalship_desc:0 "Although it has long been tradition for nobles to lead troops, the fact of the matter is that most of them know next to nothing about strategy and tactics. Therefore, it is in our best interest to strip them of their ranks and focus on finding more competent leaders."

  MWY_sc_reinforce_military_tradition:0 "Reinforce Military Traditions"
  MWY_sc_reinforce_military_tradition_desc:0 "While many nobles have shown themselves to be downright incompetent military leaders, but that's nothing some tutoring and war games can't fix. Tradition is tradition for a reason, and it would be unwise to change it up now."

  MWY_sc_knight_experience:0 "Knightly Prowess"
  MWY_sc_knight_experience_desc:0 "The knights of New Mareway are the best of the best when it comes to our soldiers. It would only be wise to allow them more freedom in their operations, to let them succeed as they see fit."

  MWY_sc_self_defense_training:0 "Self-Defense Lessons"
  MWY_sc_self_defense_training_desc:0 "The last Queen, my mother, died because she couldn't defend herself. I will suffer the same fate. If Blood Mane comes looking for a fight, then I shall give her a fight."

  MWY_sc_expand_the_retinue:0 "Expand the Royal Retinue"
  MWY_sc_expand_the_retinue_desc:0 "The Retinue has protected the crown for years, and soon the time will come that they will need to defend the realm itself. Unfortunately they are far to few to put up any real fight, so an effort must be made to expand it."

  MWY_sc_heroic_knights:0 "Heroes of Legend"
  MWY_sc_heroic_knights_desc:0 "Some knights have achieved feats so great that their names and actions are the things of legend across the wasteland: Sir Golden Shield, Slayer of the Starspawn; Dame Sprinkle Spear, Liberator of Rowport; Sir Gatorgate, Shield of the Swamps, just to name a few. Should we call for their help, they will surely be of endless use to the crown."

  MWY_sc_spymaster_marshal_coop:0 "The Conscription Scheme"
  MWY_sc_spymaster_marshal_coop_desc:0 "The most pressing matter that effects our armed forces is that of sheer ponypower. Tradition dictates that only a select few, that of the knights and retinue should form the standing army, with levies only being raised in times of crisis. This system is no longer tenable if New Mareway is to survive. We must find a way to conscript the masses."

  MWY_sc_find_a_modern_gun:0 "The Two-Century Gun"
  MWY_sc_find_a_modern_gun_desc:0 "The humble Macintosh-6 Lavender Rifle, an old design even by the time of the war, it still served reliably as the baseline for Equestria's infantry weapons. Even after 200 years of the wasteland, these guns still work like new. The quality of this gun cannot be understated, and we should endeavor to outfit our entire army with them."

  MWY_sc_learn_from_the_best:0 "Learn from the Best"
  MWY_sc_learn_from_the_best_desc:0 "There is nobody with more combat experience in our realm than the knights. Their advice and training would be invaluable to our growing armed forces, and would allow us to field a new generation of elite troops."

  MWY_sc_royal_arms_manufactory:0 "Open the Royal Arms Manufactory"
  MWY_sc_royal_arms_manufactory_desc:0 "Much of the city is owned by the royal family, including many old, unused factories. We should form a group to bring these factories back into their own to produce new weapons and gear in the name of the crown."

  MWY_sc_old_equestrian_doctrine:0 "Old Equestrian Doctrine"
  MWY_sc_old_equestrian_doctrine_desc:0 "As the rightful inheritors of Equestrian Nobility, we should model our army to wartime standards. Knights to officers, levies to battalions, and granting the Queen the title of Commander-in-Chief, all while bringing the army into a true successor to the once grand Equestrian Army."

  MWY_sc_project_invicible:0 "Project: §AInvincible§!"
  MWY_sc_project_invicible_desc:0 "Power armor was once the purview of only the most elite of Equestria's armed forces, and surely our knights qualify as that. Designs have been uncovered for a prototype suit of power armor intended for use by the Royal Guard, if we can find a way to produce them, our knight's will rival even the Steel Rangers."

  MWY_sc_focus_on_famine:0 "Focus on Famine"
  MWY_sc_focus_on_famine_desc:0 "The risk of starvation runs rampant throughout the serfs, and should they die, who else will work the fields? Surely it won't be the knights and nobles. Therefore, it is our prerogative to ensure that the serfs don't starve to death."

  MWY_sc_serf_protections:0 "Grant Token Protections"
  MWY_sc_serf_protections_desc:0 "While the nobles are openly hostile to the idea of complete liberation to the serfs, some bad eggs have proved that some protections to the serfs are needed. In order to appease the serfs, and not ruffle too many noble feathers, a few token rights must be given."

  MWY_sc_laissez_faire_diplomacy:0 "Laissez Faire Diplomacy"
  MWY_sc_laissez_faire_diplomacy_desc:0 "While the Queen has jurisdiction over the goings on inside the realm, the nobles have long since engaged in diplomacy and trade with outside powers on their own accord. It has often benefited everyone in the past, so we should do our best to encourage such actions."

  MWY_sc_legalize_serf_trades:0 "Legalize Serf Trades"
  MWY_sc_legalize_serf_trades_desc:0 "The act of purchasing serfs from other nobles, much less outside powers has been illegal since the founding of New Mareway. Arguments have been made that making such a trade-good available would do wonders to the economy, allowing for the crown and nobility more control over where serfs work."

  MWY_sc_estates_general:0 "The Estates General"
  MWY_sc_estates_general_desc:0 "The current system of the royal court has proven to not be able to keep up with the growing population of New Mareway. Assembling groups of the three classes to decide what to petitions and offers to the royal court would smooth out the process greatly."

  MWY_sc_advice_from_the_council:0 "Advice from the Council"
  MWY_sc_advice_from_the_council_desc:0 "No single pony could hope to manage a realm the size of New Mareway by themselves. With the privy council's help though, we can delegate the more specialized affairs of state to our most trusted advisors."

  MWY_sc_never_another_shatterhorn:0 "Never Another Shatterhorn"
  MWY_sc_never_another_shatterhorn_desc:0 "The Shatterhorn Insurrection was a watershed moment to the nobles of New Mareway. The level of violence and barbarity perpetrated by serfs had never been seen before, and just goes to show that the serfs can never be trusted with full autonomy."

  MWY_sc_raise_new_counts:0 "Raise New Counts"
  MWY_sc_raise_new_counts_desc:0 "There is quite a bit of extraneous land held throughout the duchies by the royal family. Managing these lands directly from the city is inefficient for everyone involved, so why don't we give the lands away. A new wave of counts would allow the land to be used to it's fullest, not to mention creating a host of very loyal nobles."

  MWY_sc_realm_survey:0 "The Great Survey of [GetYear] ALB"
  MWY_sc_realm_survey_desc:0 "Much of New Mareway's population has simply fallen through the cracks; competing surveys funded by different nobles each give slightly different numbers. To remedy this issue, a royal survey must be held, documenting every single stallion, mare, and foal (and their social class) in the realm."

  MWY_sc_approach_the_cathedral:0 "Approach the Cathedral"
  MWY_sc_approach_the_cathedral_desc:0 "Although there is some rumors of [EYE.GetLeader]'s Empire supplying the Bloody Army with troops and supplies, the Cathedral itself has always remained amicable to outsiders, should you manage to get through the Everfree, of course. We should send an envoy to bargain for their support, though working with slavers may upset a few in our realm."

  MWY_sc_little_mareway_embassy:0 "Delegation in Little Mareway"
  MWY_sc_little_mareway_embassy_desc:0 "Just across the Mareway River is the small settlement of Little Mareway. In recent years it has changed hooves from barbaric raiders to the relative stability of [EYE.GetLeader]'s Empire. Many in the realm are eager to engage in trade and diplomacy with Fillydelphia, and sending a delegation just across the river seems like a good place to start."

  MWY_sc_deal_with_the_devil:0 "A Deal with the Devil"
  MWY_sc_deal_with_the_devil_desc:0 "In our dealings with the Fillydelphia slavers, we have noticed the similarities between our two realms, and some believe that a closer relationship is in order..."

  MWY_sc_neocastle_industry:0 "Neocastle Workshops"
  MWY_sc_neocastle_industry_desc:0 "Although Neocastle doesn't have the heavy industry of Fillydelphia, the effectiveness of it's artisan workshops cannot be understated. Inviting a handful of the artisan guilds to set up shop in New Mareway would prove to be productive in the future."

  MWY_sc_guild_system:0 "Empower Artisan Guilds"
  MWY_sc_guild_system_desc:0 "One of the key differences between Neocastle and New Mareway is the power of their guilds; In New Mareway, they are relegated to nothing more than middle class workers, while in Neocastle, they have a considerable say in how the realm is managed."

  MWY_sc_fillydelphia_industry:0 "Fillydelphia Factories"
  MWY_sc_fillydelphia_industry_desc:0 "The sheer magnitude of Fillydelphia's industry cannot be understated, producing unfathomable amounts of equipment for [EYE.GetLeader]'s Army every single day. Restoring some of the pre-war factories left in Mareway would be a step towards reproducing Fillydelphia's success."

  MWY_sc_realm_quotas:0 "Institute Realm Quotas"
  MWY_sc_realm_quotas_desc:0 "One of the things that makes Fillydelphia such an industrial juggernaut is the masses of enslaved workers that man the factories. Although our system of serfdom is nowhere near as barbaric as slavery, we can still institute a work quota serfs are required to meet each day."

  MWY_sc_urban_idustrialization:0 "Urban Industrialization"
  MWY_sc_urban_idustrialization_desc:0 "The city of New Mareway holds great industrial potential, be it from restoring pre-war factories, or encouraging homegrown workshops. Either way, industry requires infrastructure to grow, so we should develop parts of the city to foster such growth."

  MWY_sc_freelance_industrialists:0 "Freelance Industrialists"
  MWY_sc_freelance_industrialists_desc:0 "The realm certainly cannot do everything by itself. We should hire outside knowledge and fund private industrial projects to expand the growth of New Mareway."

  MWY_sc_duchy_industry:0 "Workshops in the Duchies"
  MWY_sc_duchy_industry_desc:0 "Most of our industry is located entirely within the city of New Mareway. In order to foster the growth of the periphery, we should invest in new industries in the duchies themselves, and the nobles will always be happy to receive new growth."

  MWY_sc_invite_branch_offices:0 "Invite Guild Branch Offices"
  MWY_sc_invite_branch_offices_desc:0 "The Three Guilds of Neocastle, the Builders, Miners, and Mechanicum, are perhaps the largest and most productive artisan guilds in the entire wasteland. With some incentivization, they could be convinced to set up satellite branches in New Mareway."

  MWY_sc_ncg_mwy_highway:0 "The Neocastle Road"
  MWY_sc_ncg_mwy_highway_desc:0 "Neocastle has long been our closest trading partner, and while much of the trade is done via the Azureway, it would be prudent to have a land based connection between our two realms. Working with the Builder's Guild, we can build a road that meets even pre-war standards that stretches from New Mareway to Neocastle."

  MWY_sc_purchase_serfs_from_oap:0 "Purchase "Serfs" from the West"
  MWY_sc_purchase_serfs_from_oap_desc:0 "Old Appleloosa is the main source for new blood into the heartlands, with thousands of ponies and other creatures passing through ever week, usually in chains. While slavery is still a dirty word in New Mareway, we could make an exchange with the Appleloosan Slavers. After buying slaves from them, we can grant them their freedom, in exchange for a contract of serfdom."

  MWY_sc_serfs_not_slaves:0 "Serfs, not Slaves"
  MWY_sc_serfs_not_slaves_desc:0 "New Mareway is better than the barbaric slavers of Old Appleloosa or Fillydelphia! Our serfs live and work in New Mareway because they chose to sign a contract, rather than being forced into chains, and are protected from the abuses of their masters by order of the crown."

  MWY_sc_universal_basic_education:0 "Universal Basic Education"
  MWY_sc_universal_basic_education_desc:0 "While some nobles disagree that the serfs should be educated, the facts of the matter is that an educated population is a more productive population, able to specialize into fields that are needed in these trying times. The crown shall bear the expense of sending every child to school, teaching them the basic skills to get them through life."

  MWY_sc_amethyst_mines:0 "Deepen Amethyst Mines"
  MWY_sc_amethyst_mines_desc:0 "The crystal mines of New Mareway are some of the last left in this region of Equestria, and still have much more to give. Utilizing new techniques will allow us to dig deeper than ever before, getting more out of our land."

  MWY_sc_estate_plantations:0 "Estate Plantations"
  MWY_sc_estate_plantations_desc:0 "Most noble estates only grow the stable crops; grains, lentils, potatoes. However, there is a growing desire for more profitable goods that can serve as the basis of luxury items or as raw material for our industry; fruits, cotton, tobacco, and sugar can all be grown in our lands with some effort."

  MWY_sc_noble_university:0 "University of New Mareway"
  MWY_sc_noble_university_desc:0 "While every pony, noble or otherwise, has access to basic schooling, many noble houses employ tutors for higher learning. If we were to centralize this into a proper university for the nobility, our realm would prosper even further."

  MWY_sc_canterlotian_revival:0 "Canterlotian Revival"
  MWY_sc_canterlotian_revival_desc:0 "Even in the age of towering steel skyscrapers and high-tech complexes, the simplistic beauty of the stone spires of Canterlot inspired awe in ponies. Now, 200 years later, where the means to build skyscrapers have been lost, a revival of the Canterlotian style has spread through New Mareway."

  MWY_sc_palace_of_the_star:0 "Palace of the Star"
  MWY_sc_palace_of_the_star_desc:0 "While the Queen's palace is luxurious, it is nothing to write home about when compared to some other structures across the wasteland. To set New Mareway apart from the rest, a truly grand palace must be constructed on the banks of the river, a real icon of the city."

  MWY_sc_crown_jewel_city:0 "The Crown Jewel"
  MWY_sc_crown_jewel_city_desc:0 "While all of the realm is special in it's own right, New Mareway has always been centered around it's namesake city, and for good reason. To truly make the city the bright, shining jewel of the realm we can allocate a dedicated amount of the royal budget exclusively for the development of the city."

  MWY_sc_the_calm_before:0 "Calm Before the Storm"
  MWY_sc_the_calm_before_desc:0 "An attack from Blood Mane is inevitable, and the only thing left to do now is wait. We have made our preparations for war, but we are better than the raiders across the river."

  MWY_sc_finishing_what_was_started:0 "Finishing What was Started"
  MWY_sc_finishing_what_was_started_desc:0 "There has never been a bigger threat to New Mareway than Blood Mane. First she struck from within, now she plots to strike from the outside with an army of bloodthirsty raiders at her back. We must strike her first."

  newmareway.25.title:0 "Hearts and Hooves Day"
  newmareway.25.desc:0 "Trumpets blared and ponies spoke in a sing-song chorus, overcome with celebratory zeal for the greatest event of the year. From all across New Mareway, every notable pony and even many less notable ones had all traveled all the way to the capitol for this one grand event. After all, Hearts and Hooves Day only comes once a year! More importantly, the accompanying feast was the single greatest opportunity for any noble looking to strike a deal or further their position.\n\nStanding atop the velvet cushioned staircase leading deeper into the Royal Palace, Queen Star Gazer was the very image of uncomfortable. She constantly shifted in her ceremonial Hearts and Hooves robes - different from her usual only by being a vibrant shade of pink that she personally found to be very garish - and greeted noble after noble as tradition mandated. It was a duty she was anything but fond of, made bearable only by Duke Littleward's firm presence at her side. With his help, she estimated they would be done shaking everypony's hooves after another hour of meaningless social torment.\n\nAfter a particularly vigorous hoofshake with one Duke Gatormaw, Star Gazer was relieved to have a break from the influx of arriving nobility. It seems they were distracted by one of the many events going on out in the city, likely the spectacular arrival of another high-ranking noble. Feeling a nudge at her side, her attention turned to her trusted Chancellor and confidant.\n\n'Posture firm and attention ahead, young Queen. And try not to look so glum. This is a celebration of life and love, after all.' Duke Littleward spoke quietly while keeping his attention ahead. Following a sigh, the Queen responded: 'What's the point? It doesn't matter if I don't smile enough or have a loose hoofshake. It'll be court gossip for a week and be forgotten by the next.'\n\nSparing a brief glance towards his liege, Duke Littleward provided a rebuttal. 'Don't think like those below your station. You aren't a ruler of gossip and slander. You are the Queen of New Mareway, the highest position within our realm and the most noble leader of any realm. You should carry yourself with the dignity owed to this lofty position, if not for the nobles than for your ponies.'\n\nCount Bright Glow's arrival prevented a response, but Littleward was pleased to see his Queen stand a little firmer and make her smile look a bit more natural before welcoming the approaching noble."

Please enjoy the festivities and join us later in the dining hall for the traditional Hearts and Hooves Day Feast!'\n\nFinishing her opening speech, Star Gazer stepped away from the end of the Grand Hall and made her way out into the rest of the Palace. Though it would be hard to get a moment of solace from the many nobles vying for her attention, she hoped to catch her breath and recompose herself before then. Fortune wouldn't favor her though, if the sound of rapidly approaching hoofsteps was anything to go by. Turning towards them, she was surprised to see Duke Pale Light of all ponies be the first to approach her tonight.\n\n'My Queen, your speech was remarkable this year, truly. I could have done no better myself, I say!' Star Gazer responded to the pleasantries in kind. 'Thank you, Duke Light. I'm happy you enjoyed it. Though I suspect you have more on your mind than just the opening ceremony.' In a hushed tone, the Duke responded.\n\n'You suspect right, my Queen. I fear I have discovered something rather... unbecoming of one of your advisors. The Spymaster, Red Widow.' Star Gazer cautiously replied. 'Unbecoming? In what way?'\n\nDuke Light spent a moment searching in the many interior pockets of his robe before holding out a small envelope. 'I welcome you to take a look for yourself. Enclosed here are a variety of financial budget reports put together with help from the Royal Treasury, along with expense reports gathered from the Office of the Spymaster. You may quickly notice that the figures provided by both are considerably different from one another. I have also taken the liberty of procuring a list of recent personal purchases made by Red Widow, going well beyond the means one would expect him to possess.'\n\nTaking the offered envelope and removing the documents in question, Star Gazer quickly verified his claims for herself. There were suspiciously missing bits and her Spymaster had made a variety of large purchases as of late. Though it was equally possible that there were other explanations for this, beyond what Pale Light was implying.\n\nContinuing, Duke Light further pushed his point. 'I would recommend his immediate removal, for the good of the realm. Of course, you would also need somepony to carry on his duties, which I would be more than willing to take on the burden of"

  newmareway.27.desc:0 "A long banquet table stretches out in front of nearly every guest, set with an array of sumptuous feasts and desserts for all to partake of. Various nobles mill about, conversing amongst themselves or taking their food to tables, while others simply stand around looking at the displays. Star Gazer spots a chatty Spring Sunflower, the duchess of Amethyst Basin. Star Gazer trots forward and smiles warmly at Spring, who returns in kind. From behind, Star Gazer's keen eye spots Wavy Waters, the Duke of the Peninsula, quietly conversing with what must his own vassals. Walking back towards the duchess, Sunflower bows politely. "Hello, Sunflower. How are you enjoying the Hearts and Hooves Day Feast so far?" Spring Sunflower nods, "I'm having a lovely time, thank you your Majesty. But I must admit, the food doesn't compare to last year." The Queen replies. "Well, I'm sure you'll find something more to your liking with dessert. Have you had the new mooncake?" Star Gazer looks over to her right, where a pastry chef continues to serve his cakes. He smiles and waves at her. "Dessert? That does sound quite wonderful, although I trust the chef will do his best not to let us down. Perhaps if I have a chance, I can sample it before the night ends." Star Gazer laughs with Spring Sunflower as she remembers her demeanor. As she continues to chat with the vain duchess, she notices that Wavy Waters has taken to politely listen from afar. Star Gazer waves at the Duke and invites him to the conversation.\n\n"Well if it isn't the master of ships." Sunflower proudly interjects, "And here I thought you were too busy with your own affairs to grace our feast with your presence." Star Gazer laughs lightly and tries to steer the conversation away from Sunflower's haughtiness. "Has the party been treating you well, Waters?" Wavy Waters bows slightly, "Yes my lady. I am honored by your invitation. It is always good to see the talents of the nobility." He faintly smiles at Sunflower, who in response blushes and fakes her own. Star Gazer then addresses both of them directly. "Let's enjoy some of the food together, perhaps I could even take on a few of your vassals in a friendly game." They all laugh together as Star Gazer leads the way to a nearby table."

  newmareway.32.desc:0 ""Your move, Sunflower."\n\nSpring Sunflower throws a sly smile in response as Star Gazer finishes her move. As the Duchess moves her hoof forward, Gazer takes the opportunity to take in the feast around her. For a moment, all the noise and the bustle of the room fades away as she looks around. For a few seconds, there was peace. The hall began to suddenly quiet around her. She felt... stillness.\n\nIn the corner of her eye, a light flickered.\n\nAnd her smile left. An overwhelming amount of light filled her vision as she was was slammed back into the wall, pinned by an invisible force. As Star Gazer collapsed from the impact, an intense ringing began to drum throughout her ears. As she struggled to look forward, she could only see the faint red of what had to be fire. She tried to get up, but her legs would no longer move. The ground beneath her was vibrating and shaking, as if she was being pulled underground. As the sound of ringing began to soften, sounds of ponies screaming in horror filled in the quiet left behind. She tried to call out, but her voice wouldn't come out. She tried to get up, but couldn't. Her eyes looked to the side and grew in horror as she saw Littleward collapsed on the floor. She tried to crawl towards him, but her body refused to move. She looked back to the front, and she saw what was behind her. The wall of flame had come from the other end of the room. It was like a bonfire, but it seemed to be spreading. It had consumed the entire room, and it was getting bigger.\n\nAs her vision began to fade, she could feel her body lifted from the ground as the shouting around her continued. As she was lifted out of the room, her vision began to grow darker until she finally passed out."

The wounds he had suffered in the attack had finally taken their toll, and there was nothing more any doctor could do to save him.\n\nStar Gazer, the Duke's loyal prodigy, sat by his side, her eyes filled with tears as she said her final goodbyes. She had been with him for as long as she could remember, and the thought of losing him was too much to bear. As Littleward's breathing grew shallower and shallower, Star Gazer leaned in close and whispered in his ear, "You will always be in my heart, Littleward. I will never forget all what you taught me, and the love we had for our people."\n\nWith a final sigh, Duke's eyes closed for the last time, and Star Gazer knew that he was gone. She let out a heartbreaking wail, her grief overwhelming.\n\nBut as the days passed, Star Gazer slowly began to heal. She knew that the duke would want her to move on and continue to protect and serve the people of Mareway. And so, she took on the mantle of leadership, determined to make sure that Mareway would never have to go through another tragedy, and to build it a future, one built from strength and kindness.\n\nOne built on from the legacy of one of the finest ponies Star Gazer knew."

  newmareway.28.title:0 "Noblesse Oblige"
  newmareway.28.desc:0 "When Equestria was consumed by arcane balefire, the lives of millions were brought to an end. In the years that followed, many more would find themselves succumbing to the desolate blight of what would come to be known as the Wasteland. However, not all were unprepared for the dark future they found themselves in. All across Equestria, the rich and influential prepared for what many of them began to see as inevitable. Numerous bunkers were stocked, luxurious Stables were prepared, and the nobility could rest easy knowing that they would outlive the apocalypse.\n\nYet as fate would have it, most of these plans ended in lethal failure. The cream of the crop within Equestrian society was nearly destroyed, with all their preparations being for nothing. Most of the greater nobility died with their nation, despite their best efforts to outlive it. Instead, another group of lesser nobility who largely lacked the means or foresight to bunker down would find themselves the last bastion of civilized aristocratic ideals within the post-War world.\n\nFor on that fateful day, rather than find themselves within the deathtrap formerly known as Canterlot, or within any of the numerous experimental Stables, these nobles instead turned up within the relatively minor city of Mareway. There, they were able to not just ride out the megaspells raining down across the land, but to also be among the first to rebuild society in their own image. The question remains though... Why were they in Mareway to begin with?"
  newmareway.28.a:0 "For the Riverside Gala."
  newmareway.28.b:0 "For an investors conference."
  newmareway.28.c:0 "They came with the first wave of refugees."

  newmareway.29.title:0 "Peasant Problems"
  newmareway.29.desc:0 "In the early days following the War, our at-the-time unofficial domain found itself dealing with an immense refugee crisis. There were many ponies to take care of, with nowhere near enough food or supplies to go around. The resultant chaos almost brought an end to the dream of a post-War Mareway before it could even begin. Thankfully, the nobility was quick to assert order and establish civilized governance with the aid of Sir Strongwing's Royal Guards. Their first mandates were to put the ponies to work, gathering or growing food and labor towards repairing any of the damage caused by the chaos.\n\nWhat began as an organized effort to build a sustainable economy rapidly devolved into a return of feudalism. The newly empowered noble class defined the workers as belonging to a lesser caste, labeling them as serfs and reinforcing their position at the bottom of the societal ladder. It was the role of these serfs and their descendants to toil away in the name of building a better society, just as it was the nobility's role to lead them to it. Such has stood as an unchallenged societal tradition for two centuries now.\n\nHowever, there are some who believe it is long past time that this changed. Many, especially those not strictly within the ranks of the born nobility themselves, have begun to advocate for widespread reform or even the abolition of the serf system. Seeing their positions within society threatened, just as many have taken up the cause of fiercely defending the traditional ways. With both sides being represented within the Royal Court, the young Queen must tread carefully around the issue lest she make more enemies than she can handle. Privately though, she.."

  newmareway.30.title:0 "Reign of Terror"
  newmareway.30.desc:0 "Fifteen years ago, Queen Star Gazer's aunt Golden Star sought to overthrow her sister and seize the throne for herself. Lacking the support of the nobility, she instead amassed an army composed of loyal knights, freed serfs, and less than savory sorts from across all of New Mareway's domain. With a mix of grand promises and extensive bribes, she was able to secure the loyalty of enough able bodies to overcome the Royal Guard, slay the former Queen Silver Star, and crown herself Queen. Unfortunately for her, this wasn't to last.\n\nWith the widespread support of the nobility, Sir Strongwing was able to form his own counter-army of surviving Royal Guards and levies. His forces marched upon the city of New Mareway just as rapidly as Golden Star's had, driving her out and bringing an end to her reign before she could firmly secure her rule. Though Strongwing himself confronted the kinslaying false Queen, he found himself caught off guard by her martial capabilities while gravely scarring her eye in the duel. He barely emerged from the fight alive and was unable to stop her forces from successfully retreating across the Azureway.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath following the counter-coup, the city of New Mareway proper was left badly damaged from the fighting and subsequent chaotic withdrawal. Yet their foes still lingered across the river, with rumors abounding of the traitor-Queen adopting the name 'Blood Mane' and vowing revenge. With the realm still in a state of chaos, it was left up to Sir Strongwing to decide what to do next."

  newmareway.31.title:0 "Wake-Up Call"
  newmareway.31.desc:0 "Sir Strongwing approached Queen Star Gazer in court with a dire sense of urgency. He knelt before her, a report in hoof, and began to speak.\n\n"Your Majesty, I bring grave news from across the realm. The Bloody Army, a ruthless and powerful force, is amassing at our borders. This report, confirmed by myself and dozens of other knights, details the threat they pose to our kingdom and our people. All of our reports say the same thing, that they hold an army large enough to storm our cities and endanger our nation."\n\nStar Gazer took the report, her expression one of concern as she began to read through it. She could see that Sir Strongwing and the other knights had not exaggerated the threat - the Bloody Army was indeed forming a formidable force, and one that could not be ignored.\n\n"Sir Strongwing, thank you for bringing this to my attention." The ghoul saluted in response as Star Gazer kept reading. "And you were sure that they were amassing an army, one already large enough to pose a threat?"\n\n"Yes, my queen. I urge you to act now, before they begin their hellish march.""

Previously a rather dull but relatively stable region due to the work of Littleward in his duties, the region now suffers from a vacancy in its rulership. Bright Glow was the next in line, a noble Star Gazer was not fond of. With the coronation quickly commencing, the queen knew that this succession would not be popular with everypony. She sent out a royal decree, announcing that Bright Glow would be crowned as the new Duke of the Grainlands in a grand ceremony to be held in the capital of the Grainlands.\n\nThe day of the coronation soon arrived and the entire kingdom was in attendance, including Star Gazer herself to introduce the new duke. She stepped forward to give a speech, her voice ringing out across the crowd.\n\n"My fellow citizens of New Mareway, today is a historic day for our kingdom. We are here to witness the coronation of Bright Glow as the new Duke of the Grainlands. I know that some of you may be hesitant about our new duke, but I assure you that it was made with the best interests of our kingdom in mind. Bright Glow is a young and ambitious leader who I believe will serve the Grainlands and the entire kingdom well."\n\nThe crowd listened attentively, some still unsure about the decision, but many also saw the potential in Bright Glow.

Dice highlights the productivity of the few pre-war manufactories left standing, and requests funding for the MDC to refurbish or construct more of such factories."

Most of them were delighted to arrive in our Republic, eager to start their new lives, although one mare promptly demanded to be brought straight to New Canterlot for an "audience with the court of Gawd".

Even while sitting, Gawd was still at least two heads taller than the teal mare before her, but she knew better than to underestimate her guest. Covered in fresh scars, and the tell-tale stony expression of a person who had seen too much, Gawd could tell that the mare standing before her was a pony of utmost determination.\n\n"So." Gawd began in her typical stern tone. "What business does a fallen queen have with a president?" she inquired, her tone making clear her opinions on royalty.\n\n"Revenge." Star Gazer spoke softly and firmly, staring straight at the griffon before her. "You speak as if the two of us are different, opposed to one another; but at the core of things, you and I are is the same. What is that desk but a wooden throne? We both care for our people, and would you not swear vengeance if someone prevented you from caring for your people?" the mare finished; each word laced with more bitterness than the last.\n\nGawd was silent for a time, pondering the curious mare and her thirst for justice.

  MWY_chancellor_name_littleward_body:0 "§L-------------------------§!\nEasily the oldest noble in Mareway, §YSparkle Littleward§! has been the loyal chancellor to three generations of the Star dynasty. Despite his traditional ways, Duke Litteward will support whatever action the crown takes §Runtil his dying breath...§!"
  MWY_chancellor_name_glow_title:0 "[ROOT.GetGlowTitleLong]"
  MWY_chancellor_name_glow_body:0 "§L-------------------------§!\nLord of the Moonglow Estates and distant member of the ruling Star dynasty, §YBright Glow§! is considered by some to be the epitome of all that is wrong with Mareway's Nobility. Arrogant, vain, and power-hungry to a fault, he is known for his lavishness."

  MWY_marshal_name_strongwing_title:0 "Captain of the Guard"
  MWY_marshal_name_strongwing_body:0 "§L-------------------------§!\n§YSir Nimbus Strongwing§! is a name that commands respect from friends and foe alike.

Having clawed his way up from a lowly serf to one of the most powerful and feared ponies of the realm, he is an outsider to the rest of the court."
  MWY_spy_name_pale_light_title:0 "Duke of the Swampy Coast"
  MWY_spy_name_pale_light_body:0 "§L-------------------------§!\nA facade of kindness and simplicity cloud the true image of §YPale Light§!, a cunning and ambitious pony who will wait a lifetime for the perfect time to strike.
