  #Opening Tree
  MWY_noble_origins:0 "Noble Origins"
  MWY_noble_origins_desc:0 "We are the heirs of Equestria's greatest ponies: the Nobility. Though the seat of nobility was once the grand city of Canterlot, our ancestors made their way to Mareway over 200 years ago."

  MWY_matter_of_serfs:0 "The Matter of the Peasantry"
  MWY_matter_of_serfs_desc:0 "Peasants, peons, serfs. There are many names for the disenfranchised masses of New Mareway. For the past two centuries, their status has remained unchanged, but the young Queen has a different vision..."

  MWY_the_tragedy:0 "The Tragedy"
  MWY_the_tragedy_desc:0 "Fifteen years ago, Baroness Golden Star launched a bloodthirsty coup against her sister, Queen Silver Star. Though she was ousted by a counter-coup, the mare now known as Blood Mane has been a thorn in our side ever since."

  MWY_alarms_raised:0 "Alarms Raised"
  MWY_alarms_raised_desc:0 "Our knights have grown stagnant all while our hated enemy grows stronger by the day. Without a wake-up call, New Mareway is doomed."

  MWY_feast_aftermath:0 "Aftermath of the Feast"
  MWY_feast_aftermath_desc:0 "Already, the attack on the Hearts and Hooves Day feast has been called the greatest tragedy since Blood Mane's coup. Suspicions are at an all time high, and calls for the death of the as of unknown perpetrators ring loudly."

  MWY_privy_council:0 "Call the Privy Council"
  MWY_privy_council_desc:0 "Composed of the realm's most powerful ponies, the privy council is needed more than ever to advise and administer New Mareway."

  MWY_new_management:0 "Under New Management"
  MWY_new_management_desc:0 "With Duke Littleward's untimely death, and no heirs to pass his holdings onto, control of the Grainlands has fallen to Count Bright Glow, and as the Queen, we are expected to attend his ducal coronation."

  MWY_serfs_hungry:0 "Plight of the Hungry"
  MWY_serfs_hungry_desc:0 "A few lackluster harvests, minor mismanagement by nobles, and the ever growing population has compounded into a looming disaster. If we don't act quickly, we may end up facing a widespread famine among the peasants."

  MWY_winter_prep:0 "Winter Preparations"
  MWY_winter_prep_desc:0 "In addition to an already looming famine, the past few winters have been particularly harsh, impacting the food crisis even further."

  MWY_let_them_eat_cake:0 "Let Them Eat Snack Cakes"
  MWY_let_them_eat_cake_desc:0 "The Shatterhorn citadel is perhaps the greatest fortification ever constructed in New Mareway. It is also known for being perhaps the worst place to be a serf, and cries against the tyranny of the lords of Shatterhorn only grow louder..."

  MWY_not_a_child:0 "No Longer a Child"
  MWY_not_a_child_desc:0 "The other nobles see the Queen as nothing more than a naive child, a stepping stone to further their own interests, but Star Gazer will prove herself to be anything but."

  MWY_friends_and_foes:0 "Discerning Friends from Foes"
  MWY_friends_and_foes_desc:0 "Despite their lavish lifestyle and smile-and-wave demeanor, the nobility of New Mareway are little more than a vicious den of vipers, ready to tear us apart at the first sign of weakness. None of them should ever be fully trusted, but we must determine which of them will serve our goals as friends, and which of them will not."

  MWY_backroom_squabbles:0 "Backroom Squabbles"
  MWY_backroom_squabbles_desc:0 "The affairs of state are a devious, tit-for-tat game of cat and mouse, even between supposed friends and allies. Unfortunately, the Queen has a shortage of those among the privy council, so to get things done, she's going to have to play the game another way..."

  MWY_stay_the_course:0 "Stay the Course"
  MWY_stay_the_course_desc:0 "Reason has won the day! The reformer Queen has seen the error of her ways, resolving to continue New Mareway down the path that has kept it safe for 200 years."

  MWY_queens_way:0 "The Queen's Way"
  MWY_queens_way_desc:0 "Without reform, Mareway will be swallowed up, be it by the greed of the nobility, the anger of the serfs, or outside forces. To survive, we must look to the past, to uphold the true values of old Equestria: Friendship and Harmony."


  #Queen's Way Tree
  MWY_qw_new_path:0 "A New Path"
  MWY_qw_new_path_desc:0 "Had we continued down that old road, New Mareway would have been just like everywhere else in the wasteland; Never improving, stagnant and rotting. It's up to us to save Mareway from itself, and be the change we wish to see in the world."

  MWY_qw_strongwing_plan:0 "Strongwing's Plan"
  MWY_qw_strongwing_plan_desc:0 "Nimbus Strongwing is loyal to the realm above all, and for years he has tried to draw attention to what he believes the greatest threat to Mareway is: Blood Mane and her army. He claims we are woefully underprepared for any major conflict with the Bloody Army, and our odds of success are low. Thankfully, he has put forward a comprehensive plan on how we can prepare ourselves."

  MWY_qw_gatormaw_exp:0 "Gatormaw's Experience"
  MWY_qw_gatormaw_exp_desc:0 "Hoof Gatormaw is perhaps the least noble noble in the entire realm; Some would go so far as to call him a barbarian, but never to his face. His personal combat experience in the wasteland is second to none in our realm, and his opinion on matters of the army should be treated with respect."

  MWY_qw_peninsula_invest:0 "Investments in the Peninsula"
  MWY_qw_peninsula_invest_desc:0 "The Mareway Peninsula is isolated and underdeveloped compared to the rest of the realm, and has great potential. It's long coastline and excellent natural harbors make it the perfect spot to invest in a naval industry."

  MWY_qw_gulf_fleet:0 "Eclipse Gulf Fleet"
  MWY_qw_gulf_fleet_desc:0 "Mareway's navy should be the pride of the Gulf! Large flotillas and ships approaching pre-war sizes is the only way to rule the waves."

  MWY_qw_river_fleet:0 "River Fleet"
  MWY_qw_river_fleet_desc:0 "Mareway is split between two rivers, the wide Ponytomic River, and the mighty Azureway. Control of both of these rivers is paramount to Mareway's continued survival, so a fleet of smaller, more manuverable ships is needed."

  MWY_qw_merchant_marines:0 "Expand the Merchant Marines"
  MWY_qw_merchant_marines_desc:0 "Piracy and disruption of trade is rampant in the Equestrian Wasteland, and we should do our best to protect our merchants from harm. Expanding retinue service to include a tour in the merchant marines should do the trick."

  MWY_qw_naval_academy:0 "Royal Naval Academy"
  MWY_qw_naval_academy_desc:0 "Civilization and nobility is what sets New Mareway apart from the rest of the wasteland, so why shouldn't the captains of our navy show the same level of nobility?"

  MWY_qw_river_watch:0 "Keeping Watch on the River"
  MWY_qw_river_watch_desc:0 "The Ponytomic River narrows considerably just beyond Maredia, allowing for an entire army to ford it with ease if they so desired. Unfortunately, there happens to be an army who desires to cross it, so adequate defenses are necessary along the river."

  MWY_qw_learning_from_loss:0 "Learning from Our Losses"
  MWY_qw_learning_from_loss_desc:0 "Blood Mane's short but brutal insurrection left many of our best knights dead, and many more unfit for combat. Though Sir Strongwing led the fight against Blood Mane herself, it was Duke Gatormaw who spent the most time cleaning up any trace of the rebellion left in New Mareway."

  MWY_qw_no_incompetence:0 "Pruning Out Incompetence"
  MWY_qw_no_incompetence_desc:0 "Though it has long been tradition for Nobles to lead their household retinue and serf levies into battle, the fact of the matter is that most of the nobles are downright incompetent military leaders, and often do more harm than good."

  MWY_qw_modern_weapons:0 "Modern Weapons for a Modern Mareway"
  MWY_qw_modern_weapons_desc:0 "Many knights still wield crude weaponry that would be considered antiquated even before the war, and most peasants eligible for levy service provide their own weapons, which often ends up being nothing more than farming equipment. This is unacceptable."

  MWY_qw_fresh_pov:0 "A Fresh Point of View"
  MWY_qw_fresh_pov_desc:0 "True improvement can never come from within, the knights are too set in their ways and the nobles too incompetent to know better. An outside opinion is needed to truly bring Mareway's Army to the next level."

  MWY_qw_knights_to_officers:0 "From Knights to Officers"
  MWY_qw_knights_to_officers_desc:0 "Our knights are highly trained and experienced combatants and leaders, so it makes sense to convert their role from leaders of peasant levies to officers in our reorganized army."

  MWY_qw_away_from_tradition:0 "Moving Away from Tradition"
  MWY_qw_away_from_tradition_desc:0 "The Retinue system has worked well for 200 years, when the biggest threat to New Mareway was minor raider bands and insignificant serf revolts. However, in the age where empires and republics field army sizes unheard of since the Great War, the comparatively tiny royal retinue is nothing but a drop in the pond."

  MWY_qw_vetting_levy_system:0 "Vetting the Levy System"
  MWY_qw_vetting_levy_system_desc:0 "Serf levies allow New Mareway to raise an large number of armed, if under-trained, troops in an extraordinary short period of time. Levy dodging is rampant, and many nobles can only guess at how many serfs are actually eligible to serve. If we are to survive, the levies must be properly vetted, trained, and armed."

  MWY_qw_heavy_industry:0 "Bring Back Heavy Industry"
  MWY_qw_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Though Mareway was never as much of a center of industry as Fillydelphia or Manehattan, it still hosted many pre-war factories, which have since been left abandoned or converted into something more useful to the wastelanders of the past two centuries. With a few spare parts and some elbow grease, these factories can be brought back to their former glory."

  MWY_qw_grand_tour:0 "The Grand Tour"
  MWY_qw_grand_tour_desc:0 "With railroads connecting every duchy in the realm, and factories to produce new parts for trains, a proper test is in order. What better than a royal tour of the realm by luxury train?"

  MWY_qw_fighting_famine:0 "Fighting Famine"
  MWY_qw_fighting_famine_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to keep all the serfs fed, the simply massive population of the realm is too much for our antiquated agriculture to handle. We must find new sources of food, be it scavenging pre-war locations or expanding trade."

  MWY_qw_society_of_giving:0 "The Royal Society of Giving"
  MWY_qw_society_of_giving_desc:0 "The Nobles have accumulated vast stores of food that they frankly don't need. Unfortunately none of them want to give it away out of the kindness of their heart, so why don't we appeal to their vanity and make giving away food a way to look better in society?"

  MWY_qw_land_reform:0 "Comprehensive Land Reform"
  MWY_qw_land_reform_desc:0 "Much of the realm's potential is squandered by archaic land rights and ownership agreements, some land goes completely unused, and there have even been cases of land still legally belonging to deceased nobles. The crown must take an active role in reforming land ownership in order to improve efficiency."

  MWY_qw_centralization_push:0 "The Push for Centralization"
  MWY_qw_centralization_push_desc:0 "The glaring flaw with our push for reform is that most of the realm is simply too detached from the rule of the crown for our actions to have any real effect. We must bring the duchies and counts into line, though they will certainly oppose us at every turn."

  MWY_qw_steward_deal:0 "A Deal with the Steward"
  MWY_qw_steward_deal_desc:0 "Sometimes, compromise is the only way forward. Call it bribery or just making a good deal, the Steward of the realm has much way with other nobles, and their vote in favor of centralization would be key to our success."

  MWY_qw_dirt_on_glow:0 "Dirt on Duke Glow"
  MWY_qw_dirt_on_glow_desc:0 "Bright Glow is the epitome of what's wrong with Mareway's nobility, and has fought against any and all attempt at further centralizing the crown's rule. Thankfully for us, he is also a deeply flawed pony, and if some of those flaws were to get out to the public..."

  MWY_qw_pulling_the_rug:0 "Pulling the Rug"
  MWY_qw_pulling_the_rug_desc:0 "The Duchies have for too long enjoyed almost complete autonomy to rule themselves how they see fit, which has lead to extreme abuses of power and general disunity within the realm. Not a day longer shall this be allowed to continue."

  MWY_qw_four_year_plan:0 "A Four-Year Plan"
  MWY_qw_four_year_plan_desc:0 "New Mareway's industry must be caught up to modern standards, and although this can't happen overnight, it's best to have a structured plan on how to achieve it."

  MWY_qw_county_loyalty:0 "Cementing County Loyalty"
  MWY_qw_county_loyalty_desc:0 "It has been said that without the support of the dukes, the Queen has no power. However, the same can be said that without the support of the counts, the dukes have no power."

  MWY_qw_connect_nation:0 "Connect the Nation"
  MWY_qw_connect_nation_desc:0 "Railroads used to stretch all across Equestria, and the rusted wrecks of these steel arteries can still be found across New Mareway. A realm cannot be truly centralized if it doesn't have an adequate method of transporting messages, material, and ponies, so it's high time we brought the railroads back."

  MWY_qw_florabama:0 "Friends in Low Places"
  MWY_qw_florabama_desc:0 "The serfs are the real foundation of power in New Mareway, without them, the Nobles would starve and wither. Star Gazer's reforms have made her perhaps the most popular Queen in the history of New Mareway."

  MWY_qw_paradigm_shift:0 "A Paradigm Shift"
  MWY_qw_paradigm_shift_desc:0 "Organized and united, the New Mareway of today is a far cry from it's autonomous roots, resembling the Equestria of old more than a wasteland nation."

  MWY_qw_open_court:0 "Open the Court to All"
  MWY_qw_open_court_desc:0 "Currently, the royal court is only open to various nobles and knights, serfs have no way of expressing their needs or gratitude to the crown. If we were to open the court to all, the realm would surely benefit."

  MWY_qw_speak_with_spymaster:0 "Speak with the Spymaster"
  MWY_qw_speak_with_spymaster_desc:0 "While the Spymaster of the realm might not be the most glorious or honorable position in court, it is perhaps the most important. The spymaster holds the ear of the crown, and their support in reforming the country is much needed."

  MWY_qw_effects_of_shatterhorn:0 "The Effects of Shatterhorn"
  MWY_qw_effects_of_shatterhorn_desc:0 "The Shatterhorn Rebellion sent shockwaves through the nobility; Never before had a serf rebellion managed to take a noble's house, much less one as fortified as Shatterhorn. We can use this fear to our advantage in court, and may be able to convince some nobles to support reform so there will never be another Shatterhorn."

  MWY_qw_declaration_of_rights:0 "The Declaration of Rights"
  MWY_qw_declaration_of_rights_desc:0 "There is apparently some debate about what rights the serfs have and what rights they have not. This injustice cannot stand. Every noble house will be sent a copy of the newly penned Declaration of Rights, so there can be no confusion any longer."

  MWY_qw_grainlands_invest:0 "Grainlands Investments"
  MWY_qw_grainlands_invest_desc:0 "The Grainlands, as the name suggests, is the breadbasket of New Mareway, though it faces the issue of being almost entirely focused on farms. Some investments in industry to support the agriculture would aid the realm greatly."

  MWY_qw_amethyst_invest:0 "Amethyst Basin Investments"
  MWY_qw_amethyst_invest_desc:0 "The ponies of the Duchy of the Amethyst Basin are a dedicated, hard-working folk, with land full of rare resources. It would be wise to foster their spirit with some investments into heavier industry."

  MWY_qw_old_farms:0 "Old Equestrian Farms"
  MWY_qw_old_farms_desc:0 "The few agricultural records that have been recovered from before the wasteland paint a stunning picture of incredibly efficient and productive farms, so attempting to replicate pre-war farming methods should surely aid us."

  MWY_qw_gem_guild:0 "Fund the Gem Cutters Guild"
  MWY_qw_gem_guild_desc:0 "The Gem Cutters Guild of the Amethyst Basin can trace it's roots all the way back to pre-war jewelers that were attracted to the stunning purple gems that gives the basin it's name. Their craft has only continued to be honed, and they produce some of the finest magical gems in the Equestrian Wasteland."

  MWY_qw_cutie_marks:0 "Embrace Cutie Marks"
  MWY_qw_cutie_marks_desc:0 "Allowing ponies to pursue their Cutie Marks have long been forgoed in wasteland, as survival has always been more important. However, New Mareway is a step above the rabble of the wasteland. Our ponies should be free to pursue what they are destined to do, rather than being stuck as a guard or farmer."

  MWY_qw_development_council:0 "Mareway Development Council"
  MWY_qw_development_council_desc:0 "Much of New Mareway remains underdeveloped and unused. We should assemble a group of the best minds of the realm and set out to solve this issue. The Mareway Development Council will be given carte blanche to pursue projects that will further the growth of the realm."

  MWY_qw_merchant_class:0 "The Fourth Class"
  MWY_qw_merchant_class_desc:0 "Though small, there is a growing middle class in New Mareway. Primarily found in the city itself, these merchants and artisans produce and supply most of what allows the nobility and knights to lead more lavish lifestyles."

  MWY_qw_economic_freedom:0 "Work Where You Want"
  MWY_qw_economic_freedom_desc:0 "Serfs should not be condemned to a lifetime of backbreaking menial labor in the fields or as a servant in a noble house. By allowing each and every serf to determine what they wish to work on, it is one step closer to complete liberation."

  MWY_qw_peninsula_project:0 "Project Night Lights"
  MWY_qw_peninsula_project_desc:0 "New Mareway's nights are lit only by candle and lantern, with few electric or magical lights. By harnessing the power of the two rivers that border the Peninsula, the Development Council aims to bring reliable electricity to the royal city."

  MWY_qw_amethyst_project:0 "Project Crystal Clear"
  MWY_qw_amethyst_project_desc:0 "Our histories teach us that disputes of gems and coal is what led to the destruction of the old world. While we may not have any coal, New Mareway is one of the few places left in the wasteland with a plentiful supply of magical gems, and the Development Council aims to turn us into a major producer once more."

  MWY_qw_old_world_knowledge:0 "Old World Knowledge"
  MWY_qw_old_world_knowledge_desc:0 "The libraries of the nobles are chock full of books from the old world, as is the ruins of Mareway itself. The secrets of old Equestria are here, we just have to find them."

  MWY_qw_neocastle_tools:0 "Buying Tools From Neocastle"
  MWY_qw_neocastle_tools_desc:0 "Although Neocastle has not reformed itself as we have, we cannot deny they are better equipped and researched than us. Thankfully, they are willing to grant us their knowledge, for a price of course."

  MWY_qw_modern_construction:0 "Modern Construction"
  MWY_qw_modern_construction_desc:0 "The Equestria of old was able to build towering skyscrapers and sprawling complexes, while Mareway is still stuck building stone fortifications and shacks from reclaimed materials. It's time to change that."

  MWY_qw_queen_of_the_people:0 "Emancipation Day"
  MWY_qw_queen_of_the_people_desc:0 "No longer will the abhorrent institution of serfdom stain our great realm! From this day forth, all Serfs in New Mareway are free from any contract or servitude to anyone, be it noble or knight."

  MWY_qw_magic_of_friendship:0 "The Magic of Friendship"
  MWY_qw_magic_of_friendship_desc:0 "The royal library contains a great deal of books from before the war, many of which once resided in Canterlot itself! Who knows what wisdom could be gained from these books..."

  MWY_qw_forgiveness:0 "§PForgiveness§!"
  MWY_qw_forgiveness_desc:0 "Golden Star, Blood Mane, my aunt. She is misguided and has hurt many ponies, yes, but that doesn't mean that she isn't deserving of love and forgiveness, so that the realm can finally be whole again."

  #Stay the Course
  MWY_sc_pragmatism_not_optimism:0 "Pragmatism, not Optimism"
  MWY_sc_pragmatism_not_optimism_desc:0 "Despite my hopes, now is not the time for reform. The wasteland is more dangerous and volatile than ever, and we must be united as a realm if New Mareway is to survive the oncoming storm."

  MWY_sc_soldiers_of_fortune:0 "Soldiers of Fortune"
  MWY_sc_soldiers_of_fortune_desc:0 "The griffon Talon Mercenaries have proven themselves to be a highly effective force in other nations, so why not hire a company for ourselves? Their services will be greatly needed in the coming years."

  MWY_sc_expand_levy_service:0 "Extend Levy Service"
  MWY_sc_expand_levy_service_desc:0 "As it stands, the Serf Levy is simply too limited to be of any real help in a full scale conflict. Extending the age limits and waiving a few other extraneous requirements will do well to squeeze more out of the levies."

  MWY_sc_coastal_strongholds:0 "Coast Strongholds"
  MWY_sc_coastal_strongholds_desc:0 "The Royal Family happens to own a number of sizable land holdings that sit on the coast, mostly having been used as vacation homes for past monarchs. Without upsetting the status quo of other Nobles, we could convert those holdings to naval strongholds."

  MWY_sc_naval_modernization:0 "A Grand Navy"
  MWY_sc_naval_modernization_desc:0 "Our prosperity allows us to focus on growing our navy into the star of the waves, projecting the influence of the crown far beyond the realm."

  MWY_sc_gulf_fleet:0 "Gulf Armada"
  MWY_sc_gulf_fleet_desc:0 "Our navy would best be served in the Eclipse Gulf, protecting our interests all the way from New Mareway to Dappleshore."

  MWY_sc_river_fleet:0 "River Flotilla"
  MWY_sc_river_fleet_desc:0 "Control of the Azureway and Ponytomic rivers is paramount to the defense of the realm, so it is only wise to dedicate the navy to preforming well in the rivers."

  MWY_sc_end_ducal_generalship:0 "End Ducal Generalship"
  MWY_sc_end_ducal_generalship_desc:0 "Although it has long been tradition for nobles to lead troops, the fact of the matter is that most of them know next to nothing about strategy and tactics. Therefore, it is in our best interest to strip them of their ranks and focus on finding more competent leaders."

  MWY_sc_reinforce_military_tradition:0 "Reinforce Military Traditions"
  MWY_sc_reinforce_military_tradition_desc:0 "While many nobles have shown themselves to be downright incompetent military leaders, but that's nothing some tutoring and war games can't fix. Tradition is tradition for a reason, and it would be unwise to change it up now."

  MWY_sc_knight_experience:0 "Knightly Prowess"
  MWY_sc_knight_experience_desc:0 "The knights of New Mareway are the best of the best when it comes to our soldiers. It would only be wise to allow them more freedom in their operations, to let them succeed as they see fit."

  MWY_sc_self_defense_training:0 "Self-Defense Lessons"
  MWY_sc_self_defense_training_desc:0 "The last Queen, my mother, died because she couldn't defend herself. I will suffer the same fate. If Blood Mane comes looking for a fight, then I shall give her a fight."

  MWY_sc_expand_the_retinue:0 "Expand the Royal Retinue"
  MWY_sc_expand_the_retinue_desc:0 "The Retinue has protected the crown for years, and soon the time will come that they will need to defend the realm itself. Unfortunately they are far to few to put up any real fight, so an effort must be made to expand it."

  MWY_sc_heroic_knights:0 "Heroes of Legend"
  MWY_sc_heroic_knights_desc:0 "Some knights have achieved feats so great that their names and actions are the things of legend across the wasteland: Sir Golden Shield, Slayer of the Starspawn; Dame Sprinkle Spear, Liberator of Rowport; Sir Gatorgate, Shield of the Swamps, just to name a few. Should we call for their help, they will surely be of endless use to the crown."

  MWY_sc_spymaster_marshal_coop:0 "The Conscription Scheme"
  MWY_sc_spymaster_marshal_coop_desc:0 "The most pressing matter that effects our armed forces is that of sheer ponypower. Tradition dictates that only a select few, that of the knights and retinue should form the standing army, with levies only being raised in times of crisis. This system is no longer tenable if New Mareway is to survive. We must find a way to conscript the masses."

  MWY_sc_find_a_modern_gun:0 "The Two-Century Gun"
  MWY_sc_find_a_modern_gun_desc:0 "The humble Macintosh-6 Lavender Rifle, an old design even by the time of the war, it still served reliably as the baseline for Equestria's infantry weapons. Even after 200 years of the wasteland, these guns still work like new. The quality of this gun cannot be understated, and we should endeavor to outfit our entire army with them."

  MWY_sc_learn_from_the_best:0 "Learn from the Best"
  MWY_sc_learn_from_the_best_desc:0 "There is nobody with more combat experience in our realm than the knights. Their advice and training would be invaluable to our growing armed forces, and would allow us to field a new generation of elite troops."

  MWY_sc_royal_arms_manufactory:0 "Open the Royal Arms Manufactory"
  MWY_sc_royal_arms_manufactory_desc:0 "Much of the city is owned by the royal family, including many old, unused factories. We should form a group to bring these factories back into their own to produce new weapons and gear in the name of the crown."

  MWY_sc_old_equestrian_doctrine:0 "Old Equestrian Doctrine"
  MWY_sc_old_equestrian_doctrine_desc:0 "As the rightful inheritors of Equestrian Nobility, we should model our army to wartime standards. Knights to officers, levies to battalions, and granting the Queen the title of Commander-in-Chief, all while bringing the army into a true successor to the once grand Equestrian Army."

  MWY_sc_project_invicible:0 "Project: §AInvincible§!"
  MWY_sc_project_invicible_desc:0 "Power armor was once the purview of only the most elite of Equestria's armed forces, and surely our knights qualify as that. Designs have been uncovered for a prototype suit of power armor intended for use by the Royal Guard, if we can find a way to produce them, our knights will rival even the Steel Rangers!"

  MWY_sc_focus_on_famine:0 "Focus on Famine"
  MWY_sc_focus_on_famine_desc:0 "The risk of starvation runs rampant throughout the serfs, and should they die, who else will work the fields? Surely it won't be the knights and nobles. Therefore, it is our prerogative to ensure that the serfs don't starve to death."

  MWY_sc_serf_protections:0 "Grant Token Protections"
  MWY_sc_serf_protections_desc:0 "While the nobles are openly hostile to the idea of complete liberation to the serfs, some bad eggs have proved that some protections to the serfs are needed. In order to appease the serfs, and not ruffle too many noble feathers, a few token rights must be given."

  MWY_sc_laissez_faire_diplomacy:0 "Laissez Faire Diplomacy"
  MWY_sc_laissez_faire_diplomacy_desc:0 "While the Queen has jurisdiction over the goings on inside the realm, the nobles have long since engaged in diplomacy and trade with outside powers on their own accord. It has often benefited everyone in the past, so we should do our best to encourage such actions."

  MWY_sc_legalize_serf_trades:0 "Legalize Serf Trades"
  MWY_sc_legalize_serf_trades_desc:0 "The act of purchasing serfs from other nobles, much less outside powers has been illegal since the founding of New Mareway. Arguments have been made that making such a trade-good available would do wonders to the economy, allowing for the crown and nobility more control over where serfs work."

  MWY_sc_estates_general:0 "The Estates General"
  MWY_sc_estates_general_desc:0 "The current system of the royal court has proven to not be able to keep up with the growing population of New Mareway. Assembling groups of the three classes to decide what to petition and offer to the royal court would smooth out the process greatly."

  MWY_sc_advice_from_the_council:0 "Advice from the Council"
  MWY_sc_advice_from_the_council_desc:0 "No single pony could hope to manage a realm the size of New Mareway by themselves. With the privy council's help though, we can delegate the more specialized affairs of state to our most trusted advisors."

  MWY_sc_never_another_shatterhorn:0 "Never Another Shatterhorn"
  MWY_sc_never_another_shatterhorn_desc:0 "The Shatterhorn Insurrection was a watershed moment to the nobles of New Mareway. The level of violence and barbarity perpetrated by serfs had never been seen before, and just goes to show that the serfs can never be trusted with full autonomy."

  MWY_sc_raise_new_counts:0 "Raise New Counts"
  MWY_sc_raise_new_counts_desc:0 "There is quite a bit of extraneous land held throughout the duchies by the royal family. Managing these lands directly from the city is inefficient for everyone involved, so why don't we give the lands away. A new wave of counts would allow the land to be used to it's fullest, not to mention creating a host of very loyal nobles."

  MWY_sc_realm_survey:0 "The Great Survey of [GetYear] ALB"
  MWY_sc_realm_survey_desc:0 "Much of New Mareway's population has simply fallen through the cracks; competing surveys funded by different nobles each give slightly different numbers.

  newmareway.25.title:0 "Hearts and Hooves Day"
  newmareway.25.desc:0 "Trumpets blared and ponies spoke in a sing-song chorus, overcome with celebratory zeal for the greatest event of the year. From all across New Mareway, every notable pony and even many less notable ones had all traveled all the way to the capitol for this one grand event. After all, Hearts and Hooves Day only comes once a year! More importantly, the accompanying feast was the single greatest opportunity for any noble looking to strike a deal or further their position.\n\nStanding atop the velvet cushioned staircase leading deeper into the Royal Palace, Queen Star Gazer was the very image of uncomfortable. She constantly shifted in her ceremonial Hearts and Hooves robes - different from her usual only by being a vibrant shade of pink that she personally found to be very garish - and greeted noble after noble as tradition mandated. It was a duty she was anything but fond of, made bearable only by Duke Littleward's firm presence at her side. With his help, she estimated they would be done shaking everypony's hooves after another hour of meaningless social torment.\n\nAfter a particularly vigorous hoofshake with one Duke Gatormaw, Star Gazer was relieved to have a break from the influx of arriving nobility. It seems they were distracted by one of the many events going on out in the city, likely the spectacular arrival of another high-ranking noble. Feeling a nudge at her side, her attention turned to her trusted Chancellor and confidant.\n\n'Posture firm and attention ahead, young Queen. And try not to look so glum. This is a celebration of life and love, after all.' Duke Littleward spoke quietly while keeping his attention ahead. Following a sigh, the Queen responded: 'What's the point? It doesn't matter if I don't smile enough or have a loose hoofshake. It'll be court gossip for a week and be forgotten by the next.'\n\nSparing a brief glance towards his liege, Duke Littleward provided a rebuttal. 'Don't think like those below your station. You aren't a ruler of gossip and slander. You are the Queen of New Mareway, the highest position within our realm and the most noble leader of any realm. You should carry yourself with the dignity owed to this lofty position, if not for the nobles than for your ponies.'\n\nCount Bright Glow's arrival prevented a response, but Littleward was pleased to see his Queen stand a little firmer and make her smile look a bit more natural before welcoming the approaching noble."

Please enjoy the festivities and join us later in the dining hall for the traditional Hearts and Hooves Day Feast!'\n\nFinishing her opening speech, Star Gazer stepped away from the end of the Grand Hall and made her way out into the rest of the Palace. Though it would be hard to get a moment of solace from the many nobles vying for her attention, she hoped to catch her breath and recompose herself before then. Fortune wouldn't favor her though, if the sound of rapidly approaching hoofsteps was anything to go by. Turning towards them, she was surprised to see Duke Pale Light of all ponies be the first to approach her tonight.\n\n'My Queen, your speech was remarkable this year, truly. I could have done no better myself, I say!' Star Gazer responded to the pleasantries in kind. 'Thank you, Duke Light. I'm happy you enjoyed it. Though I suspect you have more on your mind than just the opening ceremony.' In a hushed tone, the Duke responded.\n\n'You suspect right, my Queen. I fear I have discovered something rather... unbecoming of one of your advisors. The Spymaster, Red Widow.' Star Gazer cautiously replied. 'Unbecoming? In what way?'\n\nDuke Light spent a moment searching in the many interior pockets of his robe before holding out a small envelope. 'I welcome you to take a look for yourself. Enclosed here are a variety of financial budget reports put together with help from the Royal Treasury, along with expense reports gathered from the Office of the Spymaster. You may quickly notice that the figures provided by both are considerably different from one another. I have also taken the liberty of procuring a list of recent personal purchases made by Red Widow, going well beyond the means one would expect him to possess.'\n\nTaking the offered envelope and removing the documents in question, Star Gazer quickly verified his claims for herself. There were suspiciously missing bits and her Spymaster had made a variety of large purchases as of late. Though it was equally possible that there were other explanations for this, beyond what Pale Light was implying.\n\nContinuing, Duke Light further pushed his point. 'I would recommend his immediate removal, for the good of the realm. Of course, you would also need somepony to carry on his duties, which I would be more than willing to take on the burden of"

  newmareway.27.title:0 "The Grand Feast" #Hearts and Hooves Day Feast
  newmareway.27.desc:0 "A long banquet table stretches out in front of nearly every guest, set with an array of sumptuous feasts and desserts for all to partake of. Various nobles mill about, conversing amongst themselves or taking their food to tables, while others simply stand around looking at the displays. Star Gazer spots a chatty Spring Sunflower, the duchess of Amethyst Basin. Star Gazer trots forward and smiles warmly at Spring, who returns in kind. From behind, Star Gazer's keen eye spots Wavy Waters, the Duke of the Peninsula, quietly conversing with what must his own vassals. Walking back towards the duchess, Sunflower bows politely. "Hello, Sunflower. How are you enjoying the Hearts and Hooves Day Feast so far?" Spring Sunflower nods, "I'm having a lovely time, thank you your Majesty. But I must admit, the food doesn't compare to last year." The Queen replies. "Well, I'm sure you'll find something more to your liking with dessert. Have you had the new mooncake?" Star Gazer looks over to her right, where a pastry chef continues to serve his cakes. He smiles and waves at her. "Dessert? That does sound quite wonderful, although I trust the chef will do his best not to let us down. Perhaps if I have a chance, I can sample it before the night ends." Star Gazer laughs with Spring Sunflower as she remembers her demeanor. As she continues to chat with the vain duchess, she notices that Wavy Waters has taken to politely listen from afar. Star Gazer waves at the Duke and invites him to the conversation.\n\n"Well if it isn't the master of ships." Sunflower proudly interjects, "And here I thought you were too busy with your own affairs to grace our feast with your presence." Star Gazer laughs lightly and tries to steer the conversation away from Sunflower's haughtiness. "Has the party been treating you well, Waters?" Wavy Waters bows slightly, "Yes my lady. I am honored by your invitation. It is always good to see the talents of the nobility." He faintly smiles at Sunflower, who in response blushes and fakes her own. Star Gazer then addresses both of them directly. "Let's enjoy some of the food together, perhaps I could even take on a few of your vassals in a friendly game." They all laugh together as Star Gazer leads the way to a nearby table."

  newmareway.32.desc:0 ""Your move, Sunflower."\n\nSpring Sunflower throws a sly smile in response as Star Gazer finishes her move. As the Duchess moves her hoof forward, Gazer takes the opportunity to take in the feast around her. For a moment, all the noise and the bustle of the room fades away as she looks around. For a few seconds, there was peace. The hall began to suddenly quiet around her. She felt... stillness.\n\nIn the corner of her eye, a light flickered.\n\nAnd her smile left. An overwhelming amount of light filled her vision as she was was slammed back into the wall, pinned by an invisible force. As Star Gazer collapsed from the impact, an intense ringing began to drum throughout her ears. As she struggled to look forward, she could only see the faint red of what had to be fire. She tried to get up, but her legs would no longer move. The ground beneath her was vibrating and shaking, as if she was being pulled underground. As the sound of ringing began to soften, sounds of ponies screaming in horror filled in the quiet left behind. She tried to call out, but her voice wouldn't come out. She tried to get up, but couldn't. Her eyes looked to the side and grew in horror as she saw Littleward collapsed on the floor. She tried to crawl towards him, but her body refused to move. She looked back to the front, and she saw what was behind her. The wall of flame had come from the other end of the room. It was like a bonfire, but it seemed to be spreading. It had consumed the entire room, and it was getting bigger.\n\nAs her vision began to fade, she could feel her body lifted from the ground as the shouting around her continued. As she was lifted out of the room, her vision began to grow darker until she finally passed out."

The wounds he had suffered in the attack had finally taken their toll, and there was nothing more any doctor could do to save him.\n\nStar Gazer, the Duke's loyal prodigy, sat by his side, her eyes filled with tears as she said her final goodbyes. She had been with him for as long as she could remember, and the thought of losing him was too much to bear. As Littleward's breathing grew shallower and shallower, Star Gazer leaned in close and whispered in his ear, "You will always be in my heart, Littleward. I will never forget all what you taught me, and the love we had for our people."\n\nWith a final sigh, Duke's eyes closed for the last time, and Star Gazer knew that he was gone. She let out a heartbreaking wail, her grief overwhelming.\n\nBut as the days passed, Star Gazer slowly began to heal. She knew that the duke would want her to move on and continue to protect and serve the people of Mareway. And so, she took on the mantle of leadership, determined to make sure that Mareway would never have to go through another tragedy, and to build it a future, one built from strength and kindness.\n\nOne built on from the legacy of one of the finest ponies Star Gazer knew."

  newmareway.28.title:0 "Noblesse Oblige"
  newmareway.28.desc:0 "When Equestria was consumed by arcane balefire, the lives of millions were brought to an end. In the years that followed, many more would find themselves succumbing to the desolate blight of what would come to be known as the Wasteland. However, not all were unprepared for the dark future they found themselves in. All across Equestria, the rich and influential prepared for what many of them began to see as inevitable. Numerous bunkers were stocked, luxurious Stables were prepared, and the nobility could rest easy knowing that they would outlive the apocalypse.\n\nYet as fate would have it, most of these plans ended in lethal failure. The cream of the crop within Equestrian society was nearly destroyed, with all their preparations being for nothing. Most of the greater nobility died with their nation, despite their best efforts to outlive it. Instead, another group of lesser nobility who largely lacked the means or foresight to bunker down would find themselves the last bastion of civilized aristocratic ideals within the post-War world.\n\nFor on that fateful day, rather than find themselves within the deathtrap formerly known as Canterlot, or within any of the numerous experimental Stables, these nobles instead turned up within the relatively minor city of Mareway. There, they were able to not just ride out the megaspells raining down across the land, but to also be among the first to rebuild society in their own image. The question remains though... Why were they in Mareway to begin with?"

  newmareway.29.title:0 "Peasant Problems"
  newmareway.29.desc:0 "In the early days following the War, our at-the-time unofficial domain found itself dealing with an immense refugee crisis. There were many ponies to take care of, with nowhere near enough food or supplies to go around. The resultant chaos almost brought an end to the dream of a post-War Mareway before it could even begin. Thankfully, the nobility was quick to assert order and establish civilized governance with the aid of Sir Strongwing's Royal Guards. Their first mandates were to put the ponies to work, gathering or growing food and labor towards repairing any of the damage caused by the chaos.\n\nWhat began as an organized effort to build a sustainable economy rapidly devolved into a return of feudalism. The newly empowered noble class defined the workers as belonging to a lesser caste, labeling them as serfs and reinforcing their position at the bottom of the societal ladder. It was the role of these serfs and their descendants to toil away in the name of building a better society, just as it was the nobility's role to lead them to it. Such has stood as an unchallenged societal tradition for two centuries now.\n\nHowever, there are some who believe it is long past time that this changed. Many, especially those not strictly within the ranks of the born nobility themselves, have begun to advocate for widespread reform or even the abolition of the serf system. Seeing their positions within society threatened, just as many have taken up the cause of fiercely defending the traditional ways. With both sides being represented within the Royal Court, the young Queen must tread carefully around the issue lest she make more enemies than she can handle. Privately though, she.."

  newmareway.30.title:0 "Reign of Terror"
  newmareway.30.desc:0 "Fifteen years ago, Queen Star Gazer's aunt Golden Star sought to overthrow her sister and seize the throne for herself. Lacking the support of the nobility, she instead amassed an army composed of loyal knights, freed serfs, and less than savory sorts from across all of New Mareway's domain. With a mix of grand promises and extensive bribes, she was able to secure the loyalty of enough able bodies to overcome the Royal Guard, slay the former Queen Silver Star, and crown herself Queen. Unfortunately for her, this wasn't to last.\n\nWith the widespread support of the nobility, Sir Strongwing was able to form his own counter-army of surviving Royal Guards and levies. His forces marched upon the city of New Mareway just as rapidly as Golden Star's had, driving her out and bringing an end to her reign before she could firmly secure her rule. Though Strongwing himself confronted the kinslaying false Queen, he found himself caught off guard by her martial capabilities while gravely scarring her eye in the duel. He barely emerged from the fight alive and was unable to stop her forces from successfully retreating across the Azureway.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath following the counter-coup, the city of New Mareway proper was left badly damaged from the fighting and subsequent chaotic withdrawal. Yet their foes still lingered across the river, with rumors abounding of the traitor-Queen adopting the name 'Blood Mane' and vowing revenge. With the realm still in a state of chaos, it was left up to Sir Strongwing to decide what to do next."

This report, confirmed by myself and dozens of other knights, details the threat they pose to our kingdom and our people. All of our reports say the same thing, that they hold an army large enough to storm our cities and endanger our nation."\n\nStar Gazer took the report, her expression one of concern as she began to read through it. She could see that Sir Strongwing and the other knights had not exaggerated the threat - the Bloody Army was indeed forming a formidable force, and one that could not be ignored.\n\n"Sir Strongwing, thank you for bringing this to my attention." The ghoul saluted in response as Star Gazer kept reading. "And you were sure that they were amassing an army, one already large enough to pose a threat?"\n\n"Yes, my queen.

She sent out a royal decree, announcing that Bright Glow would be crowned as the new Duke of the Grainlands in a grand ceremony to be held in the capital of the Grainlands.\n\nThe day of the coronation soon arrived and the entire kingdom was in attendance, including Star Gazer herself to introduce the new duke. She stepped forward to give a speech, her voice ringing out across the crowd.\n\n"My fellow citizens of New Mareway, today is a historic day for our kingdom. We are here to witness the coronation of Bright Glow as the new Duke of the Grainlands. I know that some of you may be hesitant about our new duke, but I assure you that it was made with the best interests of our kingdom in mind. Bright Glow is a young and ambitious leader who I believe will serve the Grainlands and the entire kingdom well."\n\nThe crowd listened attentively, some still unsure about the decision, but many also saw the potential in Bright Glow.

The aftermath is one of chaos and confusion.\n\nAs Queen Star Gazer surveys the damage and comforts survivors, a growing chorus of voices rises among the nobility and the common ponies. They demand answers and justice. They want to know who was responsible for this act of terror that shattered their hearts and their kingdom.\n\nYet, even as the people cry out for answers, Star Gazer sees the true potential consequence from the crisis. The wounded need care, and the city of Mareway itself requires reconstruction and healing. The resources of the kingdom are stretched thin, and a decision must be made.\n\nStar Gazer stands at a crossroads, torn between the clamor for justice and the immediate needs of her people.

The attackers were like phantoms, leaving no trace of their presence.\n\nThe voices of her advisors echoed in her mind, each suggesting a direction to point the blame. Blood Mane, the lurking specter of the Bloody Army, seemed a tempting target. But were they truly responsible, or was this a ruse to divert her gaze?\n\nThen there were the serfs, restless and discontent, their frustrations simmering beneath the surface. Could this have been their desperate bid for change, their plea for a voice? Blaming them would surely sow discord, but ignoring their plight might stoke a rebellion that could ruin the kingdom more.\n\nLastly, the mirror reflected back the visage of a ruler who had failed. A leader who had promised safety and unity, yet now stood empty-hooved, unable to provide the answers her subjects yearned for.\n\nStar Gazer's heart ached with the weight of her decision. Each path held its own risks, its own potential for further turmoil. But she was not one to shy away from her duty, even when faced with the cruel sting of uncertainty."

Together, we have built a realm that thrives on unity, on the bonds that tie us together. Let us not forget the legacy that brought us here."\n\nStar Gazer's voice echoed through the chamber, each word a testament to her belief in the strength of her kingdom. She spoke not as a ruler separated from her subjects, but as a queen bound to them by a shared destiny.\n\n"In this time of uncertainty, let us find solace in each other. Let us reforge the bonds that have sustained us for generations. For it is not in casting blame, but in standing together, that we shall overcome any trial that befalls us."\n\nAs her words hung in the air, a renewed sense of purpose filled the chamber.

Today, it had transformed into a crucible of rebellion, a symbol of defiance against tyranny.\n\nWord had reached Queen Star Gazer that the serfs had risen in rebellion. Shatterhorn had fallen to their hooves, and from its ramparts hung the grim evidence of their vengeance - the lifeless forms of several nobles who had met their end at the end of a rope.\n\nThe citadel itself was a formidable fortress, surrounded by a gaping chasm and accessible only by a treacherous bridge. Inside, desperate serfs had barricaded themselves, determined to hold their newfound stronghold. The remnants of the nobility had sought refuge in the highest towers, their former arrogance replaced by terror.\n\nIn the royal court, turmoil and panic reigned. The nobles, their faces now ashen with fear, pleaded with Queen Star Gazer to deploy the knights and quell the rebellion with force.\n\nHowever, the queen faced a moment of profound decision. She stood at a crossroads where her choice could either extinguish the rebellion in a torrent of blood or open the door to dialogue and understanding. While her advisors clamored for swift military action, Star Gazer contemplated an alternative path, one that would address the deep-seated grievances that had ignited this uprising.

"Many are mercenaries at heart, their loyalty tied to gold rather than ideals. Through the shadows, I've reached out and found a raider leader who sees the winds changing. For the right price, they're willing to switch flags."\n\nMurmurs filled the room, a mixture of intrigue and skepticism. To conscript those who had once preyed upon the edges of Mareway was a gamble that could either secure the kingdom's borders or invite a fox into the henhouse.\n\n"Or," interjected another general, this one much more stern-faced, "we could look to the Talon Company. Mercenaries, yes, but with a code. Their discipline is unmatched, and their loyalty, while bought, is ironclad."\n\nThe Queen pondered both options. To extend an olive branch to the raiders was to believe in the possibility of redemption, of turning foes into protectors. Yet, the reliability of the Talon Company was a tempting prospect, offering a straightforward solution to bolstering their ranks with proven warriors."

  newmareway.56.desc:0 "The halls of the Bloody Army's stronghold, usually echoing with the clamor of steel and the harsh orders of its leaders, were gripped by a tense silence. The word had spread like wildfire through the ranks: General Pink Peony, one of their most formidable strategists and a terror on the battlefield, had deserted. Not just deserted, but crossed the river to New Mareway, carrying with her knowledge that could tilt the scales in the ongoing struggle for power.\n\nThe news struck like a hammer to the heart of the Bloody Army's command. Pink Peony, known for her ruthlessness as much as her unmatched skill in combat, had been a pillar of strength in their campaigns. Her departure was not just a loss of a general; it was a betrayal that cut deep, sowing seeds of doubt and anger among the ranks.\n\nIn the war room, the atmosphere was thick with fury and the desire for retribution. "That fucking traitor!" roared Blood Mane, her voice echoing off the stone walls with a promise of vengeance. The sentiment was echoed by her generals, their loyalty to the cause unshaken but now fueled by a thirst for revenge against the perceived treachery of New Mareway and the deserter who sought refuge within its borders.\n\nThe desertion of Pink Peony was not just an act of defiance; it was a declaration of war, a challenge that the Bloody Army was all too eager to answer. With grim determination, they prepared for the inevitable conflict, knowing that the battle lines were drawn not just across the river but within the hearts of those who dared to defy them."

Once a feared name among her former comrades, she now stood as a testament to change, her allegiance shifted by the promise of a new purpose in New Mareway. The raid, meticulously planned and flawlessly executed, was a bold statement to friends and foes alike: the dawn of a new era for the realm's military approach, guided by the very person who once waged war upon its borders.\n\nThe echoes of the night's swift violence lingered as Peony and her unit, a mix of New Mareway's soldiers and former adversaries turned allies, receded into the shadows from which they had emerged. This victory was not marked by the clash of swords or the roar of triumph but by the profound silence of a foe outmaneuvered and outthought. It was a silence that spoke volumes, heralding a shift in the tide of conflict that had long plagued the land.\n\nThe villagers of New Mareway, once skeptical of the raider turned defender, would awake to whispers of the night's success. "It seems that the warlord was useful after all," they would say, their words a mix of astonishment and burgeoning respect. For Pink Peony, these whispers were a bittersweet affirmation of her new path, a road paved with redemption and the heavy burden of her past deeds.\n\nAs the first light of dawn painted the sky, it cast a long shadow over the figure of Peony, who, standing amidst the remnants of her strategic triumph, contemplated the road ahead. This raid was but the first of many challenges she would face in her quest to safeguard New Mareway and redefine her legacy."

This raid, intended as a decisive blow against the Bloody Army, had instead revealed vulnerabilities within New Mareway's ranks, a harsh reminder of the long road ahead in their quest for security and strength.\n\nThe defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, challenging the faith placed in Peony, a former raider whose knowledge of the enemy was seen as an invaluable asset. Yet, in the face of this setback, the spirit of determination that had driven them to embrace change did not waver completely.\n\nPeony, absorbing the weight of the moment, knew the path forward was fraught with challenges. The loss was not just a personal failure but a collective setback for New Mareway. It underscored the need for further preparation, for introspection, and for unity. The dream of a reformed army, capable of standing toe-to-toe with the likes of Blood Mane, remained distant."

The early hours had brought with them the threat of a meticulously planned assault on their ranks, a bold move by New Mareway that sought to exploit their supposed vulnerabilities. Yet, in the face of betrayal and underestimation, the Bloody Army's might had proven unyielding.\n\nThe failed raid was a testament not only to their strength but to their unity in the face of adversity. Pink Peony, once a revered general among their ranks, had turned her back on them, seeking to undermine the very foundation she had helped to fortify. Her actions, marked by disloyalty, had steeled the resolve of the Bloody Army, reinforcing their determination to stand vigilant against any who would threaten their dominion.\n\nYet, the victory was not without its warnings. The audacity of New Mareway's attempt spoke of a newfound boldness, a willingness to challenge the Bloody Army directly. "We've held, for now," the commanders acknowledged among themselves, aware that this skirmish was but a harbinger of the escalating conflict that loomed on the horizon.\n\nThe defense against Pink Peony's raid had underscored a critical reality: New Mareway was no longer a passive neighbor but an active contender, marshaling its forces for what could only be anticipated as a significant confrontation. The Bloody Army, victorious yet vigilant, recognized the need to fortify their ranks, to prepare for the inevitable strife that awaited.\n\nThe aftermath of the battle was a time for regrouping, for reflection on the loyalty that bound them and the threats that faced them. It was a momentary respite, a breath drawn in the quiet before the storm.

  newmareway.65.desc:0 "Under the guise of a genteel tea gathering in the Royal Gardens, Queen Star Gazer sought to subtly weave the fabric of loyalty among New Mareway's nobility, aiming to temper the influence of traditionalist powerhouses like Duke Bright Glow and Duchess Spring Sunflower. The garden, blooming with the last gifts of summer, served as the stage for this delicate dance of diplomacy.\n\nAs the tea was poured, Bright Glow, ever the embodiment of noble excess, was quick to flaunt his disdain for reform. "Your attempts to erode the foundations of our way of life are amusing, Your Majesty," he sneered, swirling his cup with an air of superiority. "The 'Marewayer Way' has served us well. Why abandon tradition for the sake of peasants' whims?"\n\nBefore the Queen could respond, Duchess Spring Sunflower chimed in, her voice dripping with condescension. "Indeed, Your Majesty, these reforms of yours threaten to upend the very hierarchy that has maintained order in our realm. We cannot allow such... liberal ideas to dilute our storied traditions."\n\nThe Queen, maintaining her composure against the thinly veiled insults, chose her words with care. "Duke Bright Glow, Duchess Sunflower, the strength of New Mareway lies not in the preservation of outdated customs but in our ability to grow. Our ponies, from the highest noble to the humblest serf, are the heart of this realm. Ignoring their needs and clinging to excess benefits none."\n\nThe rebuttal hung in the air, a challenge laid bare against the backdrop of the tranquil garden. The Queen's gaze, steady and unwavering, met each of theirs in turn, an unspoken declaration of her commitment to the future of New Mareway—a future where the monarchy sought a direct bond with its people, bypassing the dukes and duchesses who viewed change with contempt."

  newmareway.66.desc:0 "In the wake of the Shatterhorn Rebellion, a palpable tension enveloped New Mareway. The serf leaders, having risen against their oppressive liege, now faced the prospect of trial—a proceeding mired in controversy and political maneuvering. With the death of their liege, the question of jurisdiction became a battleground of ideals between the traditional nobility and the forces of reform led by Queen Star Gazer.\n\nDuke Bright Glow, embodying the resistance to change, vocally championed the trial's jurisdiction falling to his court. "The laws of our land have always granted such matters to the local liege. To bypass this tradition," he argued in a council meeting, "is to undermine the very fabric of our noble rights."\n\nThe Queen, however, stood firm in her conviction that justice for the serfs could not be entrusted to the same system that had failed them. "The impartiality of a royal judge is paramount," she countered, her voice steady with the weight of her office. "This is not about usurping feudal rights but ensuring fair and just treatment for all our subjects. The rebellion, though regrettable, speaks to a deeper need for reform within our realm."\n\nThe debate raged, echoes of dissent mingling with cautious support. The nobles, wary of setting a precedent that might dilute their power, saw the royal intervention as a direct challenge to their authority. Meanwhile, reformers hailed it as a necessary step towards centralization and a more equitable system of governance.\n\nAs the Queen pushed for a trial under royal jurisdiction, she knew the path to unity was fraught with obstacles.

Even up in Tenpony Tower, I hear, will you find Mareway fish."\n\nThe train wheels squeal as they come to stop, the doors opening up, for the Queen and her gathered nobles to exit. She gives Wavy a small smile and a nod, before stepping out, taking in the town, seeing many have gathered around to see her, and the Dukes behind her. Wavy Waters stands proud and silent as the many fisher ponies bow in her presence, with her eyes looking past them a bit, and instead to ponies in odd, but expensive, fashion, not like that of the nobles, but still costly.\n\nDuke Waters clears his throat, "Ah yes, the merchants. You shouldn't mind them, my Queen, their... new age sense of fashion is not common outside of their class. Now, how about we go on a tour around the town? There's many sights to see, many important vassals of mine to meet."\n\nThe Queen gives him a small smile, "Thank you, Duke Waters, but a good Queen should be seen mingling with her subjects." She then trots forward, towards a group of the merchants, who bow their heads in her presence.

The realm has changed, hasn't it?"\n\nDuchess Sunflower laughs to herself before speaking, fanning herself in her seat, "She's like a foal, fascinated with those beneath her, refusing to listen to those who know better, just wait until we arrive in my realm, I'm sure she'll scorn me in order to frolic with the dirty serfs, just like she did back there. Unbelievable, her mother would faint if she knew her daughter would galavant around with haughty serfs who believe they've risen above their proper station." Quietly, Duke Waters would nod, but not say much more.\n\nDuke Glow nods, "And how she has centralized powers, how are we meant to control anything she does? What if the day comes where she tries to take our realms, our titles, our very way of life? What would we do?"

There would be a few stops in places Star Gazer already knew due to time here under Duke Littleward, but her knowledge didn't stop Duke Glow from going into painful detail about every little thing.\n\nThe next stop would be the second largest province, Amethyst Basin, ruled over by Duchess Sunflower, renowned for its food production and the few rock farms it has. They would stop at the Duchess' personal estate, with her and her vassals showing off their wealth through fancy jewelry, covered in magical gemstones, even offering one to the Queen herself. Little time would be spent actually exploring the duchy, instead spent almost entirely in the Duchess' estate, before then departing to the south.\n\nMany serfs would be disappointed in the wake of the tour, not having been able to see their Queen or her entourage, only hearing of it from their lords and ladies."

The others in her entourage would not be happy with the Queen's actions, but they would silently go along with it, talking in hushed tones about their Queen spending time with serfs over time with them. After a day, however, it would come time to depart, with serfs cheering by the tracks as the Queen waves goodbye, a genuine smile on her face, and a satisfied grin on the face of Duke Light, as the train goes to its next destination.\n\nThe Radigator Coast is unlike anywhere else in the realm, for the ponies here are not similar at all. They do not have the civilized ways of other duchies, the quiet, reserved manners of speaking, instead they'd all be loud, boisterous, and ignore any personal space. When the train stopped, it'd be met by an impromptu celebration by the locals, not having been set up like in the Swampy Coast, but instead done spontaneously by the lively ponies. Commoners would practically drag the Queen out of the train, pulling along the fighting and disgusted Dukes Glow, Waters, and Duchess Sunflower with the Queen. Duke Gatormaw would watch as the Queen was fed gumbo and jambalaya, with even the normally reserved Duke cracking a smirk as she coughed and sputtered from the spice.\n\nNopony was sure they could taste anymore as they left the Radigator Coasts with burning tongues, running noses, and watery eyes, but they all knew one thing.

She would reject advice from nobles in order to spend it on merchants, and nopony knows how long it'll be before she extends this further, stripping nobles of their titles, even, Celestia forbid, abdicating and making a republic. The fear is different for every lord as they return home, the reasoning is never the same, some are hungry for power, some are scorned, others simply afraid of their own ruler. But the action is the same.\n\nAcross the realm, soldiers have been levied to preserve the traditions of New Mareway, to restore the realm, to make Mareway great again. Civil war hangs over the heads of every serf, every lord, every pony within the nation, and even as the soldiers grab their guns, their swords, and prepare to fight, they know they'll be killing their own brothers for the whims of nobles who would never spare them a second thought. But tradition demands, and they respond.\n\nWhat would the nobles do if the Queen came after their power? That question was finally spoken, as the first shots ring out across the land."

She recalled the Swampy Coast, how serfs would speak to her, thinking of one mare in specific. She looked just like the Queen, but older, rougher, and she thanked the Queen, she said that her family had once been starving even as they worked, and that all seemed hopeless. She said that the Queen brought hope to their lives, like Celestia did to Equestria, hope that their lives would get better, their bellies would be full, that they would be truly happy. It reminded the Queen of why what she does is important, and now she turns back to her throne, a confident look to her face, reinvigorated."

He hadn't made it far across the border before he was caught, bashed over the head and dragged off, forced awake in a dark room, filled with Blood Mane's top raiders and advisors, along with the mare herself.\n\nBlood Mane glared down at him, and rose a hoof, conversations around him dying down, as she then points to him, oddly calm given the rumors around her. Strider would clear his throat, dry with worry, and slowly stand up from the ground, speaking in a shaky voice, "Blood Mane, I come... I come bearing a letter from Queen Star Gazer of New Mareway. She offers amnesty for you and your ponies, and... forgiveness, for what happened. She wants you home as family, not an enemy."\n\nThe pony's words would be met by laughter all around, with raiders poking fun at his shaky tone, others shouting to just kill him, or send him to fight for entertainment, maybe even a slave. Strider would shake, his legs weak, surrounded by ponies who want nothing more than to kill him. However, all of their shouting would stop as Blood Mane ripped out a pistol, firing it into the roof, the sudden noise making them all shut up.\n\nShe looked at Lane Strider, and then spoke, decisively..."

Her eyes looked down at him, filled with nervousness, traces of hope, and worry. All of that disappeared as the chamberlain slowly floated up a severed head, the head of the poor messenger-colt she sent to offer amnesty to the Bloody Army. She looked down, and then waved the chamberlain to leave, the pony happily doing so.\n\nSlowly she would rise from her throne, trotting to a nearby window, facing north, sighing as she looks out of it, "I had hoped bloodshed could be prevented. But all I did was send a stallion to his death. Why couldn't you just accept? We could have... could have done so much better." Slowly, she would turn away from the window, taking a small breath, slowly returning to her throne, not surprised, but saddened."

Blood Mane sits on one side, staring directly at Star Gazer as she slowly lifts a cup of tea, sipping from it, before putting it back down. The tension was palpable, even a dull knife would be able to cut it. Star Gazer would open her mouth, but be cut off by Blood Mane before she can even speak, "Cut the shit, Star. Stop trying to act like this is normal, or like this is all good. Why? Why did you forgive me, why forgive the Army?! You know what I did!" She would slam a hoof on the table, making her own tea spill, "I killed your mother. I tried to take your throne. I ruined your fucking life, why do you get to sit here like some smug bitch and forgive me, hmm?"\n\nStar Gazer would look down for a second, closing her eyes, taking in a breath, before then speaking, softly, "There's one thing that Duke Littleward made sure to teach me all these years, and that's history. Understanding it, refusing to make the same mistakes. He told me once about Nightmare Moon, how she attempted to kill her own sister and take her place, and when she returned, when Princess Luna returned, Princess Celestia met her jealousy with forgiveness. In the Journal of Friendship, there's stories about acceptance, how it helped shape Equestria." Blood Mane would open her mouth, but Star Gazer looks into her eyes, making her remain quiet, "You're my family. I won't pretend I love you right now. But I might, sometime. Friendship and love is what ties ponies together, and in the Wasteland, it's all we really have."\n\nStar Gazer would extend her foreleg to Blood Mane, who would look at it, frowning in silence for a minute. Slowly, she would reach out her own hoof, bumping Gazer's own, Aunt and Niece giving each other small nods for the first time in their lives."

But times are changing, and royalty must change with them. With the horrible Hearts and Hooves day attack, and the everpresent threat of outside influences or assassins, Queen Star Gazer has decided to pick up a sword, learning how to protect herself from the most loyal knight in the land, Sir Strongwing.\n\nSweat would coat Star Gazer's brow for the first time in a long, long time, her muscles aching, crying for relief, and many parts of her body sore, wracked with pains from days of learning self defense. But slowly, she is improving, holding to a finely made rapier, a true noble's weapon, moving it deftly to block strikes from Sir Strongwing. A thrust would come from above, she steps to the side, he stabs at her legs, she steps back, another thrust at her stomach, another step to the side and a parry with her blade, always keeping it up and between her and her foe. Strongwing would look at her, keeping his spear pointed, before slowly pulling it back, "You have learned well very quickly, my Queen. You have done well."\n\nShe smiles softly, slowly sheathing her rapier, wiping her brow off with a cloth, taking a moment to breathe.

You were smart to come to me, his... traditional tactics won't lead you anywhere quickly."\n\nAs part of her training in martial matters, Queen Star Gazer had been learning new military tactics, but Strongwing has proven lacking in that area, all of his ideas being two hundred years out of date. With possible wars on the horizon, it became clear a new teacher was needed, which is what led her to Gatormaw, as he has lived in the wastes, and understands how they work.\n\nGatormaw would sit forward, drinking his own drink, before setting it down, "War isn't about formations and rigid order, Star Gazer. War is about winning and killing your enemy, and the longer you spend getting into formation, the longer the enemy has to kill you. It's hard to be a thinking pony when the enemy has already chopped your head off, isn't it? You need to be aggressive, strong, dangerous, give the enemy no time to prepare, no opportunity to respond, strike quick and strike hard.

They've given us a proposal, they want an alliance with us, and they can offer quite a bit. It would be costly to push into their lands, and it would be better to have a local community hold the area against our enemies to the south. They can also offer many supplies, not much compared to what we already have, but every little bit helps.\n\nOnly one issue, they request that we pull all aid away from the Bloody Army and Blood Mane. Blood Mane is a bit unstable, but she's also loyal, mostly, though that might just be born of desperation. It is possible that Blood Mane will seek to betray us when she finally wins, so she is an unstable ally. However, New Mareway has approached us of their own will, they're much more willing to join an alliance with us, and keep it far into the future. It falls to us to decide what to do."

They might not be the most scrupulous of allies, but none can deny the sheer power this alliance has given us.\n\nOne of our stipulations was that all aid be removed to Blood Mane, and it would seem that they have listened.

Our system is old, restrictive, suitable more for a century ago than modern day, built more around the ideas of knights and levies than pure soldiers. We have many more ponies than the Bloody Army, and yet these systems hold us back and make us equal or even lesser to her armies. So, Queen Star Gazer has gathered nobles and asked for opinions on how to fix this issue.\n\nTwo main parties have emerged, with two different ways they want to reform the army. One side wants a massive restructuring to the system by pure force of either strength or bureaucratic will, the greatest force known to pony-kind. Using force would be simple and effective, and not affect the realm at large, but it would likely hurt the army in the short term. The other side wants to find support for conscription across New Mareway, be it through the nobles or the serfs themselves. This would leave the army very stable, but it could possibly destabilize the realm at large. Of course, there is always another option, Queen Star Gazer can take charge and do it herself, though she might anger many nobles by doing such."

Many saw the change to the army as a disgrace, many had their offices removed and replaced with new ones, and others were just left behind in the modernization.\n\nNew Mareway has new mares ready to fight, but it will take a while for the armed forces to adjust to the new way of doing things.

Simple things, like that, and being under Blood Mane, he got to enjoy very many simple things. One thing he never enjoyed, however, were those who fought back, he just wanted to watch suffering, after all, not cause it, that would be horrible.\n\nWhen Queen Star Gazer was seized and brought to Rusty, he was happy, another prisoner is another prisoner, after all, and a royal prisoner at that, it was wonderful. But then Star Gazer began to fight him, but she didn't just struggle, no, she actually fought, she fought well enough that she knocked him out. By the time he woke up, six other stallions were passed out, and she was gone. Being the prison master, it fell to him to report to Blood Mane, and face her fury.\n\nRusty Shackles was a simple stallion, all he wanted was a prison and some chains around hooves.

Even while sitting, Gawd was still at least two heads taller than the teal mare before her, but she knew better than to underestimate her guest. Covered in fresh scars, and the tell-tale stony expression of a person who had seen too much, Gawd could tell that the mare standing before her was a pony of utmost determination.\n\n"So." Gawd began in her typical stern tone. "What business does a fallen queen have with a president?" she inquired, her tone making clear her opinions on royalty.\n\n"Revenge."

Well, from the serfs, of course, so when the realm demands levies to be raised, that means less serfs to serve on the homestead, under their noble lords. Of course, during times of war, this is acceptable, but when peace returns, many nobles expect that the levies will be disbanded so they can return to their farmsteads. This hasn't happened, despite the realm currently being at peace, levies are still raised, and this has caused many nobles to complain about a lack of serfs.\n\nNobles have come to the court asking for levies to be disbanded. Of course, the realm could have many reasons to keep them raised, but doing so will anger many in the court, and will cost the realm some power over its politics. Disbanding the levies will, of course, get rid of them, and will make sure that the nobles are kept happy. In either case, a decision has to be made."

Saving those crops would be good for the realm, but it would cost her valuable hooves. She could always turn the ponies away, let them harvest as much as they can, after all, it's not her fault that they didn't have enough to farm.

They've come to petition for soldiers to be sent to their village, so they may hunt down and be rid of the bandits.\n\nOf course, it would be very helpful to kill the bandits, it'd keep the law around the realm and would show serfs that we will protect them, making them more likely to join up during wars. However, it's likely that soldiers would die, equipment would break or be lost, and it would in general detract from the army.

But at the same time, allowing one tyrant would send a signal of hypocrisy through the realm, that she would speak against tyranny yet not act when a chance presented itself. This hypocrisy would remove a bunch of her credibility and destabilize her efforts, and the realm as a whole, but would keep the noble happy. With all that in mind, she would decide."
  court_affairs.5.a:0 "Set things right."
  court_affairs.5.b:0 "The nobles can manage their realm."

  court_affairs.6.title:0 "Squabbling Nobles"
  court_affairs.6.desc:0 "In what was supposed to be a usual council meeting, where nobles can talk alongside the Queen, an argument would arise. Since it's nobles arguing, it's something that doesn't really matter and is just based in pride and stupidity, and yet the two nobles are arguing still. [ROOT.GetDuke1Name] claims that Princess Celestia was the better Princess and could beat Princess Luna in a fight, while [ROOT.GetDuke2Name] retorts with the claim that Princess Luna is the better Princess and that she could beat Princess Celestia in a fight.\n\nIt isn't an issue that actually matters, but they turn to the Queen to decide which of them is right, and what she says will definitely improve relations with one, and hurt relations with the other. Of course, she could simply stomp her hoof down and say that both [ROOT.GetDuke1Name] and [ROOT.GetDuke2Name] should stop arguing and come to a compromise, but that will drain even more of her brainpower, even if it will result in no change in relations. With [ROOT.GetDuke1Name] and [ROOT.GetDuke2Name] looking at her, she would sigh and choose..."
  court_affairs.6.a:0 "Side with [ROOT.GetDuke1Name]."
  court_affairs.6.b:0 "Side with [ROOT.GetDuke2Name]."
  court_affairs.6.c:0 "Defuse the argument."

  court_affairs.7.title:0 "A Nasty Rumor"
  court_affairs.7.desc:0 "Conspiracy! Well, at least, that's the rumor going around right now, not that anybody actually believes it, all except one. Nobody knows how it started, but a rumor has spread around like wildfire, claiming that the Queen has been secretly consorting with a serf revolutionary late at night. Of course, this is ridiculous, and most would just ignore the rumor, but one noble has caught it and chosen to believe it. There's nothing to be done, that duchy will now not trust the Queen nearly as much."
  court_affairs.7.a:0 "That's not true!"

  court_affairs.8.title:0 "Some Good Gossip"
  court_affairs.8.desc:0 "Rumor has spread around the court like wildfire the past few days, talking about how the Queen's policies have saved the lives of some serfs and helped a duchy leave near bankruptcy. These rumors are exaggerated, a bit, but it has caught the attention of one duchy in particular. They'd now appreciate the Queen and her policies even more, and would be more likely to be on her side."
  court_affairs.8.a:0 "Great to hear!"

  court_affairs.9.title:0 "Long Day at Court"
  court_affairs.9.desc:0 "Sometimes decades happen in minutes, and other times minutes happen in decades, and today would be the latter. Queen Star Gazer would be sat at court, dealing with noble after noble, courtesan after courtesan, serf after serf, none of them with anything that actually matters, just little requests, small petitions, little issues. It feels like a century has passed since she last woke up, her eyes are heavy, her brain is in bed already, and yet here she is, listening to another noble prattle on about nothing. Slowly, she'd turn her head to the side, looking out of a window, only to discover it's only two in the afternoon. Sighing, she turns back to the noble, with a trained impassive look on her face."
  court_affairs.9.a:0 "I want to go to bed..."

  court_affairs.10.title:0 "Faux Pas at Court"
  court_affairs.10.desc:0 "Today the court had a lovely lunch in the middle of them talking, the freshest crops from around the realm, along with the best exports from the rest of Equestria, would line the plates of the nobles in Mareway. Queen Star Gazer would love her meal, with it being just a bit too big for her, making her feel full and tired. Satisfied with her meal, she would place down her silverware, only for a gasp to fill the court. All were shocked to see she had her fork at a one hundred and eighty degree angle, straight up and down, while her knife was at seventy seven point six degrees, an ancient sign that means 'I wish death upon everyone in this room for this meal was so horrible'. This insult has not been easily forgotten, and Star Gazer has has to expend much of her time to correcting this mistake."
  court_affairs.10.a:0 "That's not what it means!"

  court_affairs.11.title:0 "Productive Day at Court"
  court_affairs.11.desc:0 "Today has been a pretty good day at court for Star Gazer. She got some good sleep, had a good breakfast, and used that energy to go through court without a hitch. She made all the popular decisions quickly, deciding in many matters of importance, getting serfs and nobles into and out of the court with hardly a pause, and even had a good sense of humor while doing it. Court would be ended slightly early, since everything was dealt with so well, giving the Queen some free time. All around the realm, ponies would be impressed that she did so well."
  court_affairs.11.a:0 "It's nice to get things done."

  court_affairs.12.title:0 "Adventurers Swear Fealty"
  court_affairs.12.desc:0 "A nice surprise would come today as a band of rag-tag adventurers would arrive to court. There would be a farmer turned fighter with a youthful optimism, a unicorn who channels music through her voice, a pony with a walking canon by his side, carrying massive guns, and even an archer, using such antiquated technology with plenty of skill. This group is known around the realm as adventurers, having defeated many bandits, many monsters, and even a dark mage who tried to steal away many serfs from the realm. They would all bow at once, pledging their service to the realm of New Mareway, with the Queen quickly organizing a knighting ceremony, welcoming the heroes."
  court_affairs.12.a:0 "Welcome to Mareway, knights."

  court_affairs.13.title:0 "Good Harvests"
  court_affairs.13.desc:0 "All around the realm, news is coming in that the harvest has been particularly good. Be it through prayers to Celestia and Luna, good management, the Queen's own reforms, hard work from the serfs, or just good weather, every duchy is reporting more food than expected. Things are looking good, and this food shall serve wonderfully in the future, being stored for any potential emergency."
  court_affairs.13.a:0 "Great news."

  MWY_chancellor_name_littleward_body:0 "§L-------------------------§!\nEasily the oldest noble in Mareway, §YSparkle Littleward§! has been the loyal chancellor to three generations of the Star dynasty. Despite his traditional ways, Duke Litteward will support whatever action the crown takes §Runtil his dying breath...§!"
  MWY_chancellor_name_glow_title:0 "[ROOT.GetGlowTitleLong]"
  MWY_chancellor_name_glow_body:0 "§L-------------------------§!\nLord of the Moonglow Estates and distant member of the ruling Star dynasty, §YBright Glow§! is considered by some to be the epitome of all that is wrong with Mareway's Nobility. Arrogant, vain, and power-hungry to a fault, he is known for his lavishness."

  MWY_marshal_name_strongwing_title:0 "Captain of the Guard"
  MWY_marshal_name_strongwing_body:0 "§L-------------------------§!\n§YSir Nimbus Strongwing§! is a name that commands respect from friends and foe alike. Before the bombs, he was a ranking member of Equestria's Royal Guards, but now serves the crown of Mareway, despite his objections to the Queen's forgiving nature."
  MWY_marshal_name_gatormaw_title:0 "Duke of the Radigator Coast"
  MWY_marshal_name_gatormaw_body:0 "§L-------------------------§!\nAt a glance, the Lord of the Radigator Coast could easily be mistaken for some raider warlord. §YHoof Gatormaw§! is an excellent combatant and leader, protecting Mareway's periphery for decades through sheer strength of body and mind."

  MWY_steward_name_wavy_waters_title:0 "Duke of the Peninsula"
  MWY_steward_name_wavy_waters_body:0 "§L-------------------------§!\nThe well-worn Master of Ships of New Mareway, §YWavy Waters§! is set firmly in tradition, although is regarded by his peers as something of a doormat. Push the right buttons, and he'll fold like a castle of cards."
  MWY_steward_name_sunflower_title:0 "Duchess of the Amethyst Basin"
  MWY_steward_name_sunflower_body:0 "§L-------------------------§!\n§YSpring Sunflower§!: at first glance, a pompous snob of a mare. But if you get to know her, you'll find that she really is a pompous snob! Reviled by her serfs and beloved by fellow nobles, Duchess Sunflower is a shining example of old Equestrian noble values.§!"

  MWY_spy_name_red_widow_title:0 "Royal Spymaster"
  MWY_spy_name_red_widow_body:0 "§L-------------------------§!\nAn enigma to even his closest allies, §YRed Widow§! is the effortlessly cunning Spymaster of the Crown. Having clawed his way up from a lowly serf to one of the most powerful and feared ponies of the realm, he is an outsider to the rest of the court."
  MWY_spy_name_pale_light_title:0 "Duke of the Swampy Coast"
  MWY_spy_name_pale_light_body:0 "§L-------------------------§!\n§YPale Light§!, a cunning and ambitious pony who will wait a lifetime for the perfect time to strike. Duke Light is simultaneously your greatest ally and most fearsome foe, §rand nopony knows his true goal...§!"
