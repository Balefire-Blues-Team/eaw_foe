detrotevent.2.t:0 "Guidelines for Peace"
detrotevent.2.d:0 "WIP\n\nDescribes post-apocalyptic detrot, with the Gangs and the Sterling society. Tells that the Gangs and the Society came to an accord 40 years ago, that secured a shaky peace. Player chooses who got the better deal"
detrotevent.2.a:0 "The Grangs"
detrotevent.2.b:0 "The Sterling Society"

detrotevent.3.t:0 "Our past and current Masters"
detrotevent.3.d:0 "WIP\n\nExplains how the Detrot Consortium willingly became a free territory of the Commonwealth to avoid war. When the Commonwealth lost the great northern expedition, Detrot seceeded, and eventually joined the Khan in hopes of profiting from a new Overlord. Player decides if we wanna push our leverage in the Khanate, or keep some more autonomy."
detrotevent.3.a:0 "We will work from within"
detrotevent.3.b:0 "Show them our Strength"

detrotevent.4.t:0 "The Mad Raider"
detrotevent.4.d:0 "WIP\n\nDeathbloom and his gang have de-facto seized the western territories and are refusing to cooperate with the Consortium. If we do not reign him in until the next negotiations about the Consortium-Contract take place, it will almost certainly plunge us into civil war."
detrotevent.4.a:0 "Raiders within and without"

detrotevent.5.t:0 "Strikes in the Factories"
detrotevent.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Workers and indentured Slaves have been staging protests and industrial sabotage. If we allow this to continue, our operations will suffer a lot of damage. If we crack down now, we can save the factories, but will certainly foster their animosity even more."
detrotevent.5.a:0 "Let them tire themselves out"
detrotevent.5.b:0 "Send in the Enforcers"

detrotevent.6.t:0 "Chainlink Lynchings"
detrotevent.6.d:0 "WIP\n\nAfter beating an indentured Slave to death, the rest of a work-detail seized their overseers and hanged them from the building they are restoring by the chains we normally keep the most disobediant workers in.\nAs word spread, more mobs have formed, roaming the streets, looking for our Overseers and Enforcers. How should we respond?"
detrotevent.6.a:0 "Place Snipers on the Roofs"
detrotevent.6.b:0 "Pull back non-essential personell"

detrotevent.7.t:0 "Unions in Sterling"
detrotevent.7.d:0 "WIP\n\nProminent agitators and Union-leaders have been spotted in Sterling, where they are suspected to have met with Agents of the Sterling Society. We are unsure if the Society acutally supports these radical elements, or if this is just another scheme by them"
detrotevent.7.a:0 "Arrest suspected Unionists"
detrotevent.7.b:0 "Extract favours from Sterling"
detrotevent.7.c:0 "If they want Radicals, they can take the Bunch!"

detrotevent.8.t:0 "The Vermillion Proclamation"
detrotevent.8.d:0 "WIP\n\nWith the Commonwealth descending into Civil war, one faction is of particular concern for us, namely the Vermillionists and their Neo-Marksist ideas of Worker-leberation. Already, we uspect their agents ahve crossed the border and begun disseminating propaganda. We need to act now if we want to keep things contained"
detrotevent.8.a:0 "Suppress the News"
detrotevent.8.b:0 "Those slaves don't even know left from right"

detrotevent.9.t:0 "The Heads of the Snake"
detrotevent.9.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Sterling Society, evidently playing both sides, has given us a tip on a meeting of the Union leaders that is soon to happen in an old subway tunnel. Of course, acting on this intel would need a large strikeforce, which will almost certainly embolden Deathbloom."
detrotevent.9.a:0 "Assemble a Strikeforce"
detrotevent.9.b:0 "Deathbloom is the real threat"

detrotevent.10.t:0 "Dinner with the Academics"
detrotevent.10.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe higher ups of the Consortium have dinner with the head of the University of Detrot. The University of Detrot is still taking on students from all over the Wasteland, having maintained it's autonomy from the gangs, and being a signatory of the Consortium Contract itself. With these dire times upon us, we finally need to tap them as a reseource. The Family wants to conscript the most able students into the military, though that will certainly agitate Deathbloom. The Sterling Society on the other hoof wishes to use the University and it's alumni to pressure and delay Deathbloom, to buy us more time."
detrotevent.10.a:0 "Conscript the Students"
detrotevent.10.b:0 "Use their influence"

detrotevent.11.t:0 "The Empty Seat"
detrotevent.11.d:0 "WIP\n\nWe are about ready to negotiate with Deathbloom, the problem is... we have no idea where exactly he is in his little fiefdom. Knowing him, he won't willingly come to negotiations unless suficiently intrigued or goated into them. We will have to send agents into the western territories to start negotiations. While the Sterling Society is great at such tasks, and has offered their assistance, we suspect that they only do so to negotiate with Deathbloom first, and cut us out of any deals."
detrotevent.11.a:0 "We'll do it ourselves"
detrotevent.11.b:0 "Let Sterling do their thing"

detrotevent.12.t:0 "Negotiations at last"
detrotevent.12.d:0 "WIP\n\nWe are finally negotiating with Deathbloom.\nDeathbloom makes some pretty strong demands. He will disband most of hid raiders and support our government, but in exchange we agree for him to keep a good amount of tax-revenue from the western territories, as well as let him maintain a small private army. It seems these terms are the only ones that would allow us to end this without bloodshed... Of course, now that he is in Detrot, we could always just order our guards to open fire on him and his retinue once they leave the building, consequences be damned."
detrotevent.12.a:0 "Agree to his terms"
detrotevent.12.b:0 "Agree, then kill him"

detrotevent.13.t:0 "Aftermath"
detrotevent.13.d:0 "WIP\n\nIt was not 6 hours after Deathbloom was gunned down by our goons, thatstrange news reached us... instead of completely shattering or performing violent reprisals upon hearing of the death of their boss, as we expected the raiders to do, they have been... quiet. Too quiet it turns out. Apparently, some members of the Unions of Detrot have approached the leaderless gang and offered them amnesty and a suspiciously large sum of caps, should the former raiders back their 'Vermillion Revolution'.\nIt seems we have traded one secessionist for another."
detrotevent.13.a:0 "Put the Guards on high Alert!"

detrotevent.14.t:0 "The Revolution"
detrotevent.14.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Vermillionist revolution has begun. The unions of Detrot, as well as agitators from the Commonwealth have organized a full on slave-revolt. Slaves, factory workers, and even many of the foreign students of the University of Detrot are fighting our enforcers in the streets. The Sterling Society has pulled back all of their forces and seems content to sit out the revolution. Threeshot si personally leading the defence of the Casino the Family uses as its headquaters."
detrotevent.14.a:0 "I will have my Detrot back!"

detrotevent.15.t:0 "The triumphant Revolution"
detrotevent.15.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Gangs have fallen before the might of the workers, and a new order is taking hold of Detrot. Threeshot has gone missing, but the majority of the Family is dead or in shackles. Already, the Worker's Syndicate of Detrot has been proclaimed, and a new Vermillio-Marksist ideology is taking root. Finally, we shall end the abhorrent practises of the Consortium, and lead the ponies of Detrot into a brighter future.\nThe Sterling Society has made overtures to our new government, offering to cooperate, and lend their efforts in a similar arrangement to their old one with the Family. Severly lacking in allies, we ahve accepted this"
detrotevent.15.a:0 "Glory to the Revolution!"

detrotevent.16.t:0 "The New Normal"
detrotevent.16.d:0 "WIP\n\nSterling has maneuvered their way into power. As Threeshot calls for a meeting with the other leaders of the consortium, she claims victory, and tries to threaten them into compliance. The representative of the Sterling Society one-ups her, by revealing that not only are snipers placed on adjacent buildings, but that all the representatives have also been poisoned with a rare, persistend MoI poison, that requires antidotes once a month for several years to be fully cured. Anypony that refuses to align with Sterling wil die a horrible death to the poison, while those who comply will be allowed to live. Threeshot is shocked, but weighs her options and chooses submission over death."
detrotevent.16.a:0 "Phase 1 complete"

detrotevent.17.t:0 "War is due"
detrotevent.17.d:0 "WIP\n\nWe have not dealt with Deathbloom in time. The Consortium is splintering apart and Deathbloom has rallied his forces to make a play at leadership. Our country is now in full-on civil war."
detrotevent.17.a:0 "For the Consortium"
detrotevent.17.b:0 "For Deathbloom"

detrotevent.18.t:0 "The Crash"
detrotevent.18.d:0 "WIP\n\nEconomy of Detrot collapses, now that the freed workers have killed most of the overseers, and the richest citizens have fled. In addition, the Khan is looking to invade us soon, though the Sterling Society is slowing down the Khanate's workings."
detrotevent.18.a:0 "From the Frying pan, into the fire"

detrotevent.19.t:0 "Joining the Effort"
detrotevent.19.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Vermillionists have won in the Commonwealth, and our citizens want us to unite with them"
detrotevent.19.a:0 "Vermillionist Unity!"
detrotevent.19.b:0 "Nah"

detrotevent.20.t:0 "Our Comrades in Detrot"
detrotevent.20.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Detrot Worker's Syndicate has requested to join us as a new state within our greater union. They are as comitted to the revolution as we are, and will gladly support us against the Khanate, now that their Slaver-masters are defeated."
detrotevent.20.a:0 "Welcome, comrades"
