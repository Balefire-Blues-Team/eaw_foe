 DEC_deathbloom_raiders_1_desc:0 "With one of the heads of the §NConsortium§!, §RDeathbloom§!, having de-facto seceeded with our western territories, we are now in very tense negotiations with him, to prevent full-on civil war within the §NConsortium§!."

 DEC_the_sterling_society:0 "§rSterling Society§!"
 DEC_the_sterling_society_desc:0 "The §rSterling Society§! is the most enigmatic and international of the three big players in the §NConsortium§!.\nThey are a cult-like organisation of Assassins and Infiltrators, mainly hired by foreigners for high-profile killings or corporate espionage.\nThe §rSterling Society§! claims to be descended from an organisation of the same name that supposedly worked from the Crystal Empire during the great war."

detrotevent.2.t:0 "Guidelines for Peace"
detrotevent.2.d:0 "WIP\n\nDescribes post-apocalyptic detrot, with the Gangs and the Sterling society. Tells that the Gangs and the Society came to an accord 40 years ago, that secured a shaky peace. Player chooses who got the better deal"
detrotevent.2.a:0 "The Grangs"
detrotevent.2.b:0 "The Sterling Society"

detrotevent.3.t:0 "Our past and current Masters"
detrotevent.3.d:0 "WIP\n\nExplains how the Detrot Consortium willingly became a free territory of the Commonwealth to avoid war. When the Commonwealth lost the great northern expedition, Detrot seceeded, and eventually joined the Khan in hopes of profiting from a new Overlord. Player decides if we wanna push our leverage in the Khanate, or keep some more autonomy."
detrotevent.3.a:0 "We will work from within"
detrotevent.3.b:0 "Show them our Strength"

detrotevent.4.t:0 "The Mad Raider"
detrotevent.4.d:0 "WIP\n\nDeathbloom and his gang have de-facto seized the western territories and are refusing to cooperate with the Consortium. If we do not reign him in until the next negotiations about the Consortium-Contract take place, it will almost certainly plunge us into civil war."
detrotevent.4.a:0 "Raiders within and without"

detrotevent.5.t:0 "Strikes in the Factories"
detrotevent.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Workers and indentured Slaves have been staging protests and industrial sabotage. If we allow this to continue, our operations will suffer a lot of damage. If we crack down now, we can save the factories, but will certainly foster their animosity even more."
detrotevent.5.a:0 "Let them tire themselves out"
detrotevent.5.b:0 "Send in the Enforcers"

detrotevent.6.t:0 "Chainlink Lynchings"
detrotevent.6.d:0 "WIP\n\nAfter beating an indentured Slave to death, the rest of a work-detail seized their overseers and hanged them from the building they are restoring by the chains we normally keep the most disobediant workers in.\nAs word spread, more mobs have formed, roaming the streets, looking for our Overseers and Enforcers. How should we respond?"
detrotevent.6.a:0 "Place Snipers on the Roofs"
detrotevent.6.b:0 "Pull back non-essential personell"

detrotevent.7.t:0 "Unions in Sterling"
detrotevent.7.d:0 "WIP\n\nProminent agitators and Union-leaders have been spotted in Sterling, where they are suspected to have met with Agents of the Sterling Society. We are unsure if the Society acutally supports these radical elements, or if this is just another scheme by them"
detrotevent.7.a:0 "Arrest suspected Unionists"
detrotevent.7.b:0 "Extract favours from Sterling"
detrotevent.7.c:0 "If they want Radicals, they can take the Bunch!"

detrotevent.8.t:0 "The Vermillion Proclamation"
detrotevent.8.d:0 "WIP\n\nWith the Commonwealth descending into Civil war, one faction is of particular concern for us, namely the Vermillionists and their Neo-Marksist ideas of Worker-leberation. Already, we uspect their agents ahve crossed the border and begun disseminating propaganda. We need to act now if we want to keep things contained"

detrotevent.8.b:0 "Those slaves don't even know left from right"

detrotevent.9.t:0 "The Heads of the Snake"
detrotevent.9.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Sterling Society, evidently playing both sides, has given us a tip on a meeting of the Union leaders that is soon to happen in an old subway tunnel. Of course, acting on this intel would need a large strikeforce, which will almost certainly embolden Deathbloom."
detrotevent.9.a:0 "Assemble a Strikeforce"
detrotevent.9.b:0 "Deathbloom is the real threat"
