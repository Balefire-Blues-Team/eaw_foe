detrotevent.1.t:0 "The Aftermath"
detrotevent.1.d:0 "WIP\n\nDescription of Detrot during Wartime. Player decides what survived."
detrotevent.1.a:0 "The Heavy Industry"
detrotevent.1.b:0 "The City Centre"
detrotevent.1.c:0 "The Granaries"

detrotevent.2.t:0 "Guidelines for Peace"
detrotevent.2.d:0 "WIP\n\nDescribes post-apocalyptic detrot, with the Gangs and the Sterling society. Tells that the Gangs and the Society came to an accord 40 years ago, that secured a shaky peace. Player chooses who got the better deal"
detrotevent.2.a:0 "The Grangs"
detrotevent.2.b:0 "The Sterling Society"

detrotevent.3.t:0 "Our past and current Masters"
detrotevent.3.d:0 "WIP\n\nExplains how the Detrot Consortium willingly became a free territory of the Commonwealth to avoid war. When the Commonwealth lost the great northern expedition, Detrot seceeded, and eventually joined the Khan in hopes of profiting from a new Overlord. Player decides if we wanna push our leverage in the Khanate, or keep some more autonomy."
detrotevent.3.a:0 "We will work from within"
detrotevent.3.b:0 "Show them our Strength"

detrotevent.4.t:0 "The Mad Raider"
detrotevent.4.d:0 "WIP\n\nDeathbloom and her gang have de-facto seized the western territories and are refusing to cooperate with the Consortium. If we do not reign her in until the next negotiations about the Consortium-Contract take place, it will almost certainly plunge us into civil war."
detrotevent.4.a:0 "Raiders within and without"

detrotevent.5.t:0 "Strikes in the Factories"
detrotevent.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Workers and indentured Slaves have been staging protests and industrial sabotage. If we allow this to continue, our operations will suffer a lot of damage. If we crack down now, we can save the factories, but will certainly foster their animosity even more."
detrotevent.5.a:0 "Let them tire themselves out"
detrotevent.5.b:0 "Send in the Enforcers"

detrotevent.6.t:0 "Chainlink Lynchings"
detrotevent.6.d:0 "WIP\n\nAfter beating an indentured Slave to death, the rest of a work-detail seized their overseers and hanged them from the building they are restoring by the chains we normally keep the most disobediant workers in.\nAs word spread, more mobs have formed, roaming the streets, looking for our Overseers and Enforcers. How should we respond?"
detrotevent.6.a:0 "Place Snipers on the Roofs"
detrotevent.6.b:0 "Pull back non-essential personell"

detrotevent.7.t:0 "Unions in Sterling"
detrotevent.7.d:0 "WIP\n\nProminent agitators and Union-leaders have been spotted in Sterling, where they are suspected to have met with Agents of the Sterling Society. We are unsure if the Society acutally supports these radical elements, or if this is just another scheme by them"
detrotevent.7.a:0 "Arrest suspected Unionists"
detrotevent.7.b:0 "Extract favours from Sterling"
detrotevent.7.c:0 "If they want Radicals, they can take the Bunch!"

detrotevent.8.t:0 "The Vermillion Proclamation"
detrotevent.8.d:0 "WIP\n\nWith the Commonwealth descending into Civil war, one faction is of particular concern for us, namely the Vermillionists and their Neo-Marksist ideas of Worker-leberation. Already, we uspect their agents ahve crossed the border and begun disseminating propaganda. We need to act now if we want to keep things contained"
detrotevent.8.a:0 "Suppress the News"
detrotevent.8.b:0 "Those slaves don't even know left from right"

detrotevent.9.t:0 "The Heads of the Snake"
detrotevent.9.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Sterling Society, evidently playing both sides, has given us a tip on a meeting of the Union leaders that is soon to happen in an old subway tunnel. Of course, acting on this intel would need a large strikeforce, which will almost certainly embolden Deathbloom."
detrotevent.9.a:0 "Assemble a Strikeforce"
detrotevent.9.b:0 "Deathbloom is the real threat"

detrotevent.10.t:0 "Dinner with the Academics"
detrotevent.10.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe higher ups of the Consortium have dinner with the head of the University of Detrot. The University of Detrot is still taking on students from all over the Wasteland, having maintained it's autonomy from the gangs, and being a signatory of the Consortium Contract itself. With these dire times upon us, we finally need to tap them as a reseource. The Family wants to conscript the most able students into the military, though that will certainly agitate Deathbloom. The Sterling Society on the other hoof wishes to use the University and it's alumni to pressure and delay Deathbloom, to buy us more time."
detrotevent.10.a:0 "Conscript the Students"
detrotevent.10.b:0 "Use their influence"

detrotevent.11.t:0 "The Empty Seat"
detrotevent.11.d:0 "WIP\n\nWe are about ready to negotiate with Deathbloom, the problem is... we have no idea where exactly she is in her little fiefdom. Knowing her, she won't willingly come to negotiations unless suficiently intrigued or goated into them. We will have to send agents into the western territories to start negotiations. While the Sterling Society is great at such tasks, and has offered their assistance, we suspect that they only do so to negotiate with Deathbloom first, and cut us out of any deals."
detrotevent.11.a:0 "We'll do it ourselves"
detrotevent.11.b:0 "Let Sterling do their thing"

detrotevent.12.t:0 "Negotiations at last"
detrotevent.12.d:0 "WIP\n\nWe are finally negotiating with Deathbloom.\nDeathbloom makes some pretty strong demands. She will disband most of her raiders and support our government, but in exchange we agree for her to keep a good amount of tax-revenue from the western territories, as well as let her maintain a small private army. It seems these terms are the only ones that would allow us to end this without bloodshed... Of course, now that she is in Detrot, we could always just order our guards to open fire on her and her retinue once they leave the building, consequences be damned."
detrotevent.12.a:0 "Agree to her terms"
detrotevent.12.b:0 "Agree, then kill her"

detrotevent.13.t:0 "Aftermath"
detrotevent.13.d:0 "WIP\n\nIt was not 6 hours after Deathbloom was gunned down by our goons, thatstrange news reached us... instead of completely shattering or performing violent reprisals upon hearing of the death of their boss, as we expected the raiders to do, they have been... quiet. Too quiet it turns out. Apparently, some members of the Unions of Detrot have approached the leaderless gang and offered them amnesty and a suspiciously large sum of caps, should the former raiders back their 'Vermillion Revolution'.\nIt seems we have traded one secessionist for another."
detrotevent.13.a:0 "Put the Guards on high Alert!"

detrotevent.14.t:0 "The Revolution"
detrotevent.14.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Vermillionist revolution has begun. The unions of Detrot, as well as agitators from the Commonwealth have organized a full on slave-revolt. Slaves, factory workers, and even many of the foreign students of the University of Detrot are fighting our enforcers in the streets. The Sterling Society has pulled back all of their forces and seems content to sit out the revolution. Threeshot si personally leading the defence of the Casino the Family uses as its headquaters."
detrotevent.14.a:0 "I will have my Detrot back!"

detrotevent.15.t:0 "The triumphant Revolution"
detrotevent.15.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Gangs have fallen before the might of the workers, and a new order is taking hold of Detrot. Threeshot has gone missing, but the majority of the Family is dead or in shackles. Already, the Worker's Syndicate of Detrot has been proclaimed, and a new Vermillio-Marksist ideology is taking root. Finally, we shall end the abhorrent practises of the Consortium, and lead the ponies of Detrot into a brighter future.\nThe Sterling Society has made overtures to our new government, offering to cooperate, and lend their efforts in a similar arrangement to their old one with the Family. Severly lacking in allies, we ahve accepted this"
detrotevent.15.a:0 "Glory to the Revolution!"

detrotevent.16.t:0 "The New Normal"
detrotevent.16.d:0 "WIP\n\nSterling has maneuvered their way into power. As Threeshot calls for a meeting with the other leaders of the consortium, she claims victory, and tries to threaten them into compliance. The representative of the Sterling Society one-ups her, by revealing that not only are snipers placed on adjacent buildings, but that all the representatives have also been poisoned with a rare, persistend MoI poison, that requires antidotes once a month for several years to be fully cured. Anypony that refuses to align with Sterling wil die a horrible death to the poison, while those who comply will be allowed to live. Threeshot is shocked, but weighs her options and chooses submission over death."
detrotevent.16.a:0 "Phase 1 complete"

detrotevent.17.t:0 "War is due"
detrotevent.17.d:0 "WIP\n\nWe have not dealt with Deathbloom in time. The Consortium is splintering apart and Deathbloom has rallied her forces to make a play at leadership. Our country is now in full-on civil war."
detrotevent.17.a:0 "For the Consortium"
detrotevent.17.b:0 "For Deathbloom"

detrotevent.18.t:0 "The Crash"
detrotevent.18.d:0 "WIP\n\nEconomy of Detrot collapses, now that the freed workers have killed most of the overseers, and the richest citizens have fled. In addition, the Khan is looking to invade us soon, though the Sterling Society is slowing down the Khanate's workings."
detrotevent.18.a:0 "From the Frying pan, into the fire"

detrotevent.19.t:0 "Joining the Effort"
detrotevent.19.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Vermillionists have won in the Commonwealth, and our citizens want us to unite with them"
detrotevent.19.a:0 "Vermillionist Unity!"
detrotevent.19.b:0 "Nah"

detrotevent.20.t:0 "Our Comrades in Detrot"
detrotevent.20.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Detrot Worker's Syndicate has requested to join us as a new state within our greater union. They are as comitted to the revolution as we are, and will gladly support us against the Khanate, now that their Slaver-masters are defeated."
detrotevent.20.a:0 "Welcome, comrades"

detrotevent.21.t:0 "By Night and Fog"
detrotevent.21.d:0 "WIP\n\nAgents of [DEC.GetNameDEF] have approached us about an alliance against the Khanate. They know we don't like the Khan, and with them having recently left the Khanate, they will surely face the Khan's anger. Now would be the prime opportunity to stand united against Grimsmasher."
detrotevent.21.a:0 "We will support them!"
detrotevent.21.b:0 "We can't afford this war."

detrotevent.22.t:0 "Arria supports us!"
detrotevent.22.d:0 "WIP\n\nArria has agreed to support our uprising against the Khan"
detrotevent.22.a:0 "Wonderful!"

detrotevent.23.t:0 "Arria denies us Support"
detrotevent.23.d:0 "WIP\n\nArria has denied us support against the Khan, we'll have to fight alone."
detrotevent.23.a:0 "Damn"

detrotevent.24.t:0 "The time of reckoning"
detrotevent.24.d:0 "WIP\n\nGrimsmasher is seeking to squash the independence of Detrot, now is our time to strike. In a two-front war we can surely defeat the Khan!"
detrotevent.24.a:0 "For Liberty!"

detrotevent.25.t:0 "The Revolution Returns!"
detrotevent.25.d:0 "WIP\n\nWe have done it! We have beaten the pretenders in the Commonwealth, and returned the revolution to it's proper glory! Vermillion Grace would be proud."
detrotevent.25.a:0 "Three Hurra's for the Revolution!"

detrotevent.26.t:0 "Vermillion Phoenix"
detrotevent.26.d:0 "WIP\n\nDespite loosing the Civil war in the Commonwealth, as well as their leader, Vermillion Grace, the revolutionaries fighting for 'Vermilio-Socialism' in the Broken Plains have at last succeeded. Regrouping in the friendly city of Detrot, the revolutionaries have dismantled the Khanate that so long threatened the Commonwealth, and now finally have successfully marched upon Kucików, kicking out the old Government.\nThis new Revolution seems much more Radical than Vermillion Grace's, still espousing his ideas, but also calling for the mass-execution of Nobles and reactionaries, while promising to liberate the workers across all of Equus."
detrotevent.26.a:0 "Didn't think they'd come back"

detrotevent.27.t:0 "War of the Phoenix"
detrotevent.27.d:0 "WIP\n\nDetrot goes to war with the Phoenix Supremacy.\nThis is a test by the Khan. If we let the Supremacy hold both Bloomfield and Snapggate, we will fail the test, and no longer be worthy of being members of the Khanate.\n\n§RFailiure will almost certainly mean an end to this game!§!"
detrotevent.27.a:0 "Let's do this!"

detrotevent.28.t:0 "The worst of failiures"
detrotevent.28.d:0 "WIP\n\nWe have failed in the war against the Phoenix Supremacy. The Khan is demanding we stand down and hand over our arms. He intends to give our western territories to the Supremacy as a reward to fellow warriors, while our core lands will be annexed into the Khanate. While we can try to resist the Khan, we are already loosing a war on 1 fornt, and it would not be wise to start another."
detrotevent.28.a:0 "We surrender"
detrotevent.28.b:0 "We'll fight to the end!"

detrotevent.29.t:0 "Detrot Surrenders"
detrotevent.29.d:0 "WIP\n\nEvent for Phoenix Supremacy.\nDetrot suddenly surrenders and is annexed by the Khanate. In recognition of our martial prowess, the Khan has granted us all of Detrot's former territories west of the Foal-River."
detrotevent.29.a:0 "[PHE.GetNameDEF] prevails!"

detrotevent.30.t:0 "Fate of the Consortium"
detrotevent.30.d:0 "WIP\n\nEvent for the Khanate\nDetrot has failed in their first conquest, and is now considered weak. The Khan commands them disbanded, and itegrated into the central Khanate, so that they may serve some use."
detrotevent.30.a:0 "Weakling Ponies..."

detrotevent.31.t:0 "Turning the River Red"
detrotevent.31.d:0 "WIP\n\nPartnership forces set out for a multi-day raid along the Foal River and the lower mare river. Abducting ponies from coastal villages, and even assaulting the occasional harbour. They are presented with the opportunity to assault a refugee camp with thausands of ponies, that could be a big haul of slaves, but would mean going inland, and facing a lot more opposition."
detrotevent.31.a:0 "Take what we have"
detrotevent.31.b:0 "Assault inland"

They are contacted by agents of the Starlight Council who offer technology, in exchange for leaving their command bunkers alone. We can continue the dismantling for resources, take their tech, or maybe make use of their insider-info"

detrotevent.33.d:0 "WIP\n\nThreeshot has dinner with the lesser heads of the families.

They are building on abandoned MOA research to make an air-gun that creates artificial Rainbooms. In the demonstration the first shot destroys the target, the gun, a random barn 2 miles away, and shatteres half the windows on Campus. This is judged a success."

detrotevent.46.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Sterling Society organizes a mock-coup where pre-planned politicians take control of the country, and seemingly purge the Sterling Society. With this, they return to purely clandestine operations, while Detrot becomes the centre of a large civilian government, that the Society still has a lot of influence over.
