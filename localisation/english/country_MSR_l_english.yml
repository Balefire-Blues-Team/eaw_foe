  MSR_Finished:0 "Crisis of Faith"
  MSR_Finished_desc:0 "The situation within the Contingent has become untenable. Between Cottage Cheese's abrasive and borderline-obsessive tendencies and the rising popularity of a pro-Steelhooves faction, it was rather inevitable that an emergency council would form to discuss the removal of the Elder."

  MSR_Continue_1:0 "Foundation of Steel"
  MSR_Continue_1_desc:0 "Technology is the only true way to move forward. We must salvage and rebuild as much as we can if we wish to not just survive, but thrive."

  ### Cottage Cheese - Continuism Path ###
  MSR_Cottage:0 "Cottage Cheese Remains"

  MSR_Cottage_Council:0 "The Council"
  MSR_Cottage_Council_desc:0 "The provisional council was just a temporary means to solve the issue of who would be Elder of this contingent. Is there really any need to keep them around?"

  MSR_Cottage_Loyalties:0 "Where Loyalties Lie"
  MSR_Cottage_Loyalties_desc:0 "The division that has plagued this contingent can be boiled down to two ponies. However, if I want to get rid of one, I will need help from the other."

  MSR_Cottage_technician:0 "Reestablishing Control"
  MSR_Cottage_technician_desc:0 "Now that the riff raff has been dealt with and the Provisionary Council decided upon. I must now turn my attention to re-affirming my control over this contingent."

  MSR_Shoring_Up_Defense:0 "Shoring Up Defenses"
  MSR_Shoring_Up_Defense_desc:0 "We are surrounded on all sides by potential enemies. Any of the factions or groups could attack us without warning. If we are to continue to survive here in Manehattan, we must make sure that every possible point of entry is properly secured."

  MSR_Focusing_Our_Efforts:0 "Focusing Our Efforts"
  MSR_Focusing_Our_Efforts_desc:0 "Our mission statement has been, and always will be the control and regulation of technology within the Equestrian Wasteland. We must continue to focus our efforts on this task if we wish to prevent another Great War from happening."

  MSR_crusaders:0 "§NCrusaders§!"
  MSR_crusaders_desc:0 "Crusader Maneframes - one of the final, most advanced innovations of the Wartime Era. These arcano-technological super-machines are capable of processing a truly immense amount of data, performing calculations far faster than anything to ever come prior, and can conduct complex simulations like nothing we've ever seen before. A machine so powerful, it could rival the greatest of pony minds..."

  MSR_A_New_Project:0 "A New Project"
  MSR_A_New_Project_desc:0 "I am not getting any younger and this 'project' of mine is going to take a while to complete. Do I risk asking the scribes for help in my endeavor?"

  MSR_Securing_Info:0 "Securing Information"
  MSR_Securing_Info_desc:0 "So much information regarding this 'project' of mine has been scattered over time. If I wish to get any further on it, I must find and secure this information before it is truly lost forever."

  MSR_A_New_Objective:0 "A New Objective"
  MSR_A_New_Objective_desc:0 "Now that we have discovered the location of a functional Crusader Maneframe, all that's left to do is to actually secure said maneframe. Unfortunately, it is currently within the domain of a bunch of bloodthirsty raiders. In much better news, it seems that they lack advanced power armor and proper weaponry. There's only one way that this can end."

  MSR_The_Mainframe:0 "The Maneframe"
  MSR_The_Mainframe_desc:0 "We may have lost some good lives but it was all worth it in the end. My Knights and Paladins now move on Stable 29 with the hopes of securing what lies inside."

  MSR_An_Unexp_Prob:0 "An Unexpected Problem"
  MSR_An_Unexp_Prob_desc:0 "It seems that the Crusader Maneframe was only half of the equation. I am still missing something, but I don't know what."

  MSR_Dark_Magic:0 "Dark Magic?"
  MSR_Dark_Magic_desc:0 "The information from these documents seem almost... made up. But if they are to be believed, the true key to immortality lies down a very dark path."

  MSR_The_Black_Book:0 "The Black Book"
  MSR_The_Black_Book_desc:0 "I did it! I found the location of this so called 'Black Book'. The only problem is that it is located within the ruins of Canterlot. This will prove difficult, but if I can persuade some Rangers to go in, I may be able to complete this project."

  MSR_Becoming_One:0 "Becoming One with Technology"
  MSR_Becoming_One_desc:0 "After waiting so long, I finally have everything I need. All that is left is to conduct the ritual and pray that it succeeds."

  ### Cottage Success Route ###

  MSR_Testing_The_Waters_S:0 "Testing the Waters"
  MSR_Testing_The_Waters_S_desc:0 "Now that I am fully integrated with the Crusader Maneframe, it is time to see what I am capable of doing. So many new possibilities have opened up for me and I fully intend to utilize them all."

  MSR_A_New_Era:0 "A New Era for the Steel Rangers"
  MSR_A_New_Era_desc:0 "With my mind and soul now fully integrated into the Crusader Maneframe, it is time to get to work. There is so much that I can do; so many new avenues opening up. I have all the time in the world and nothing standing in my way. I, alone, will usher in a new era for the Steel Rangers."

  MSR_maneframe_improvements:0 "Maneframe Improvements"
  MSR_maneframe_improvements_desc:0 "The capabilities of this Crusader Maneframe are immense, but I find myself limited by my environment. I must see more, know more, have more. Sensors will be expanded, each and every set of power armor shall contain a relay, and the Scribes will be put to work tapping into as many of the cities old network systems as possible. I shall become one with all of technology, each new terminal and component enhancing my processing power even further."

  MSR_Review_Our_Ind:0 "Review Our Industry"
  MSR_Review_Our_Ind_desc:0 "Our industry is something I am proud of, but I know it can grow beyond its current state. Hopefully, with my new found processing power, I can work to increase our industrial capabilities to pre-war standards."

  MSR_Recal_Ind_Out:0 "Recalculate Industrial Output"
  MSR_Recal_Ind_Out_desc:0 "Our scribes work on repairing or stripping technology individually. This process is only effective if they are given small batches of technology at a time. With some simple calculations, I am sure I could help increase the scribes' technological output by at least 70%."

  MSR_Anal_Res_Ext:0 "Analyze Resource Extraction"
  MSR_Anal_Res_Ext_desc:0 "When we send out scavenging teams, they just start searching for anything useful to us. This process of scavenging is greatly inefficient and feels almost like a waste of their time. However, using my new capabilities, I will be able to reorganize our scavenging teams into highly efficient resource extractors."

  MSR_Auto_Eff:0 "Automated Efficiency"
  MSR_Auto_Eff_desc:0 "There are so many mundane tasks that our scribes and knights are forced to do in order to keep Bucklyn Cross running. This is a blatant waste of perfectly good ponypower; one that should not have gone unnoticed for this long. Now that I am in control of our base's robots, I intend to make good use of those old Mr. Handy's."

  MSR_Rev_Our_Army:0 "Review Our Armed Forces"
  MSR_Rev_Our_Army_desc:0 "Our Steel Rangers have been a force to be reckoned with within the ruins of Manehattan. However, they still can become better; it is just going to take some work. Luckily, I have all the time in the world now to make sure our Rangers are at their absolute best."

  MSR_Eval_Ranger_Training:0 "Evaluate Ranger Training Programs"
  MSR_Eval_Ranger_Training_desc:0 "The training to become a Steel Ranger is something to not be taken lightly. I should know, I went through it. However, I know I can do more to make sure the training the initiates receive is truly the best. Thanks to my new ability to analyze large amounts of data within seconds, I will be able to figure out what to keep within the training program and what to change."

  MSR_Enforce_Chain_Binds:0 "Enforcing the Chain That Bind"
  MSR_Enforce_Chain_Binds_desc:0 "The Chain That Binds is the cornerstone of our organization, the rock that supports the great tree of the Steel Rangers and its myriad of branches. For too long we have ignored this policy, giving commands freely and without care. If we wish to continue to survive, we must enforce it once more while punishing those who stray from it."

  MSR_A_New_Army:0 "A New Army of Steel"
  MSR_A_New_Army_desc:0 "Our troops have been more of a glorified defense force rather than a fully-fledged army. Thanks to my now endless computing capability and increased lifespan, I have been able to drastically change how our armed forces function. Soon, the wasteland will tremble at the might of the Manehattan Steel Rangers!"

  MSR_Looking_Out:0 "Looking Outwards"
  MSR_Looking_Out_desc:0 "For too long the Steel Rangers of Manehattan have been stuck in the background. Hiding away in Bucklyn Cross; surrounded from all sides by potential enemies. It is time we stand up and say no more. We will rise, like a phoenix from its ashes, and take back the city of Manehattan for ourselves."

  MSR_Looking_Westward:0 "Looking Westward"
  MSR_Looking_Westward_desc:0 "The west is home to two very powerful factions, both of which hold vast quantities of land and resources. Their presence has been a constant threat to us, but maybe it is time we turn the tables on them. If we could get our hooves on their resources, then we would be set for a while."             

  MSR_Enter_New_Trotbany:0 "Entering New Trotbany"
  MSR_Enter_New_Trotbany_desc:0 "Just like when the Visigoths marched into Roam after conquering the city, so did my Steel Rangers march into New Trotbany as conquerors. The siege of the city may have put a strain on our already limited resources. But once we get their territories under our control, we should see a massive increase in our resource stockpiles."

  MSR_A_Summer_In_Summer:0 "A Summer in Summerfield"
  MSR_A_Summer_In_Summer_desc:0 "Before the Great War, Summerfield was supposed to be a quiet suburb. There, young couples would go to start families and old couples would live out the rest of their lives. Now it sits in a state of ruin, rotting away as raiders turned it into their home. Maybe after we clear out the raiders we could turn this trash heap back into something livable."

  MSR_Repairing_the_roads:0 "Repairing the Roadways"
  MSR_Repairing_the_roads_desc:0 "With the lands to our east now secured, we can begin focusing on some reconstruction efforts. There isn't much out in this region, but there are a number of old roads that could serve some purpose. If we spend the time and resources to repair them, I calculate that both our trade and military deployment speed would increase by at least 35%."

  MSR_Moving_South:0 "Moving South"
  MSR_Moving_South_desc:0 "Just south of Bucklyn Cross lies a number of very minor factions; most of whom have never presented a real danger. However, if any one of them gained full control of the peninsula, then they would pose a threat to our security. In order to prevent that, we will move in and secure the region before any of them can."

  MSR_Breaking_Peninsula:0 "Breaking the Peninsula"
  MSR_Breaking_Peninsula_desc:0 "There is still much resistance to my rule within the Manehattan peninsula. They may not be privy to our sudden arrival, but they must understand that we are here to do them good. However, if they still won't accept me as their new guardian, I will gladly show them why they shouldn't disobey my rule."

  MSR_Getting_Rid_Raiders:0 "Getting Rid of the Raiders"
  MSR_Getting_Rid_Raiders_desc:0 "Even after we destroyed the bulk of their raider forces, the Manehattan raiders continue to be a nuisance to anypony who move through that region. I think it is time we took care of these raider remnants once and for all. Only when they are all completely wiped off the face of Equus will I be satisfied."

  MSR_Securing_Tenpony:0 "Securing Tenpony"
  MSR_Securing_Tenpony_desc:0 "Tenpony is the pride and jewel of the Manehattan ruins. It has stood strong for over 200 years, housing those who have the caps to pay in luxury that isn't seen anywhere else. However, what many don't know is that Tenpony also houses a large stockpile of technology that once belonged to the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. Now with Tenpony under our control, we can begin to crack open those vaults."

  MSR_Retaking_the_East:0 "Retaking the East"
  MSR_Retaking_the_East_desc:0 "There may not be a lot to the east of us, but that doesn't mean that they are entirely useless. There are still some resources we could gain from controlling that territory, not to mention the old dockyards."

  MSR_Clearing_Arbu:0 "Clearing Arbu"
  MSR_Clearing_Arbu_desc:0 "Arbu surprisingly tried to fight back against my sudden takeover; something I did not expect from them. They seemed like they were trying to hide something from us but we haven't figured out what. Our best guess is that they might have some technology that they don't want us to have. I'll be sure to have some knights search every inch of that settlement once we clean up the last of the resistance."

  MSR_Controlling_Ports:0 "Controlling the Ports"
  MSR_Controlling_Ports_desc:0 "Portshoof may not seem like such a strategic location to others, but I know better. The old Manehattan drydocks hold many secrets within them, especially since Equestria's Eastern fleet called them home. Maybe we will even get lucky and find a still intact warship. One can only hope."

  MSR_Rebuilding_Dockyards:0 "Rebuilding the Dockyards"
  MSR_Rebuilding_Dockyards_desc:0 "The Manehattan dockyards were once a bustling center of trade, shipping a plethora of goods to various locations. Now they are just another scrap heap in the ruins of the city. However, using some of our newly gained resources we could attempt to get these docks back into working order. This could prove beneficial if we wish to increase our ability to trade, or even decide to build a navy of our own."

  MSR_A_Wealth_Technology:0 "A Wealth of Technology"
  MSR_A_Wealth_Technology_desc:0 "Ever since I completed my goal of becoming one with technology, the Steel Rangers have become more than I imagined. Not only have we had a territorial increase of well beyond 1000%, but we have increased out tech stockpiles well beyond their capacity. Never have I been prouder to see our mission come to pass. This is truly a great era for the Steel Rangers."

  MSR_A_New_City_Rises:0 "A New City Rises"
  MSR_A_New_City_Rises_desc:0 "I may have been called crazy in the past, but there is no doubt that I have brought greatness to the Steel Rangers. For the first time in 200 years, the entire city of Manehattan is under the control of a single faction. With the city's combined resources I could not just rebuild Bucklyn Cross, but the entirety of Manehattan. It may be a costly endeavor to take on, but it would also cement the Steel Ranger name into history. Forever!"

  ### Cottage Failure Route ###

  MSR_Testing_The_Waters_F:0 "Testing the Waters"
  MSR_Testing_The_Waters_F_desc:0 "Now that I am fully integrated with the Crusader Maneframe, it is time to see what I am capable of doing. So many new possibilities have opened up for me and I fully intend to utilize them all."

  MSR_The_Crash_desc:0 "Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck!"

  MSR_Eval_Situation:0 "Evaluating the Situation"
  MSR_Eval_Situation_desc:0 "It seems that something has happened to our Elder. We don't know what, however. We must look into this before the others start to take notice of his absence."

  MSR_New_Provisional_Council:0 "Form A New Provisional Council"
  MSR_New_Provisional_Council_desc:0 "With the Elder declared dead the Manehattan Steel Rangers are in a state of chaos. We must form an emergency council in order to regain some stability."

  MSR_Call_Back_Teams:0 "Call Back the Scavenging Teams"
  MSR_Call_Back_Teams_desc:0 "With so many issues on the home front the Council doesn't think it is wise to continue sending out scavenging teams. Therefore it has been decided that we will cease all outside scavenging operations at least until things settle down."

  MSR_Secure_Our_Ass:0 "Secure Our Assets"
  MSR_Secure_Our_Ass_desc:0 "With so many stockpiles of technology within our territory we need to make sure that they are all accounted for. We can't afford losing anything from them, as that could cause problems for us in the future."

  MSR_Geat_Head_Count:0 "Get a Head Count"
  MSR_Geat_Head_Count_desc:0 "With so many Steel Rangers working outside Bucklyn Cross we must ensure that each of them has heeded our call to return. If any Ranger is missing, we must figure out where they have gone to and bring them back."

  MSR_Limit_Outside_Operation:0 "Limit Outside Operations"
  MSR_Limit_Outside_Operation_desc:0 "We can't fully cut ourselves off, as we still have missions to conduct and resources to gather. Instead we will limit outside operations to only those that the Council deems necessary."

  MSR_Deal_With_The_Traitors:0 "Deal With the 'Traitors'"
  MSR_Deal_With_The_Traitors_desc:0 "The idea that our Elder was using dark magic to achieve immortality within a machine is knowledge that the council does not want to get out. Because of this, it has been decided that we will label anypony who had intimate knowledge of the Elder's plans as 'traitors' and deal with them immediately."

  MSR_Reinforce_Old_Ways:0 "Reinforce the Old Ways"
  MSR_Reinforce_Old_Ways_desc:0 "Due to the Elder's obsession with his project we had begun to stray from our mission. If we wish to regain any of our lost honor, we must reinforce the old ways by any means necessary."

  MSR_Purge_Any_Opposition:0 "Purge Any Opposition"
  MSR_Purge_Any_Opposition_desc:0 "We must ensure that the Manehattan Steel Rangers are united as one. To that end, we will have to rid ourselves of anypony who doesn't fully agree with what we are doing."

  MSR_Enforce_Lock_Down:0 "Enforce Lockdown Protocol"
  MSR_Enforce_Lock_Down_desc:0 "Our enemies hunt us like animals; if we wish to protect ourselves, we must hide. Enacting the lockdown protocol will ensure that our enemies can't find us and our rangers stay safe. It will be tough to endure, but we do this for the greater good of our contingent."

  MSR_Evaluate_Our_Contingent:0 "Evaluate Our Contingent"
  MSR_Evaluate_Our_Contingent_desc:0 "This contingent has been through a lot in the past couple of weeks. The Council has deemed it necessary to evaluate the contingent to make sure that we are still up to Steel Ranger standards."

  MSR_Cease_Outsider_Recruitment:0 "Cease Outsider Recruitment"
  MSR_Cease_Outsider_Recruitment_desc:0 "It is hard to say if we can really trust any of these outsiders. With no way to truly pinpoint exactly who these ponies are or where they came from, the Council has decided that it would be best to cease all outside recruitment until 'further notice.'"

  MSR_Dissuade_Outside_Contact:0 "Dissuade Outside Contact"
  MSR_Dissuade_Outside_Contact_desc:0 "Many of these outsiders carry diseases, leech off our limited resources, or have ulterior motives. These reasons alone are enough to implement a non-member contact rule. It will be enforced until the Council decides otherwise."

  MSR_Ensure_Steel_Ranger_Purity:0 "Ensure Steel Ranger Purity"
  MSR_Ensure_Steel_Ranger_Purity_desc:0 "We will be conducting medical tests of every one of our members. This is to ensure that they are all fit and healthy to serve within our ranks. Those who do not meet our standards will be swiftly dealt with."

  MSR_Strict_Isolation:0 "Strict Isolationism"
  MSR_Strict_Isolation_desc:0 "We have exposed ourselves too much to the wasteland. We were told that this would do us good, but all it has done is drive us to the brink of total collapse. To ensure our continued existence we have to cut ourselves off from the rest of the wasteland."

  ### River Autumn Intro - Deposime Path ###
  MSR_River:0 "End of the Deadlock"
  MSR_River_desc:0 "The provisional council was gone quiet. Nopony knew what happened to them, but some began to worry. That worry only increased when the sound of energy weapons reverberated from the Elder's quarters."

  MSR_The_New_Dev:0 "The New Elder"
  MSR_The_New_Dev_desc:0 "As much as River Autumn wanted to dance on the ashes of her former Elder, she knew she couldn't celebrate just yet. There was still a long way to go before she could truly claim victory and declaring herself Elder was only the first step."

  MSR_Secure_Our_Tech:0 "Secure our Tech"
  MSR_Secure_Our_Tech_desc:0 "Over the past couple of months, my co-conspirators and I have been diligent enough to stash away a large quantity of valuable technology. If we want to be able to keep the momentum going, we must secure these stashes."

  MSR_Seize_The_Memes:0 "Seize the Means of Production"
  MSR_Seize_The_Memes_desc:0 "With my forces now somewhat armed we can begin moving to seize the factories and trade routes. If we can get them under our control, we might be able to gain the upperhoof."

  MSR_Scribe_Support:0 "Guarantee Scribe Support"
  MSR_Scribe_Support_desc:0 "Many of Scribes within our ranks have sworn their loyalty to me, but there are still those whose allegiance is unknown. I must ensure that I have their full support before I proceed with my next step."

  MSR_Storm_The_Armory:0 "Storm the Armory"
  MSR_Storm_The_Armory_desc:0 "With my troops ready to go, we can now begin our final push towards the armory. If we can secure its contents before they seal it off, nothing will stand in our way of achieving victory."

  MSR_Gather_The_Rangers:0 "Gather the Rangers"
  MSR_Gather_The_Rangers_desc:0 "Convincing the lower ranks to join me is not what will be difficult. The hard part is assuring them that I was in the right to kill the former Elder and take his place."

  MSR_Secure_Loyalty:0 "Secure Paladin Loyalty"
  MSR_Secure_Loyalty_desc:0 "The Paladins are a fierce bunch of warriors who are completely devoted to the Steel Ranger cause. And as much as it would be easy to just kill them, convincing a few to join me could help legitimize my position even more."

  MSR_Dissent:0 "Deal with Dissent"
  MSR_Dissent_desc:0 "It is disheartening to see that there are still some who see me as a murderer who took power for personal gain. They are correct. However, I would prefer that they didn't voice their opinions so openly."

  MSR_Night_Of_Long_Knives:0 "Night of Long Knives"
  MSR_Night_Of_Long_Knives_desc:0 "It is a shame to waste such good talent, but then again, I never fully trusted any of them. In the end this is just another chore I am going to have to deal with before reaching my end goal."

  MSR_Thorn_In_My_Side:0 "A Thorn in my Side"
  MSR_Thorn_In_My_Side_desc:0 "Though my power continues to grow each day, one persistent stallion keeps attempting to stop me. That rat bastard Steelhooves and his so called 'Applejack's Rangers' have become a real pain in my flank. I think it is high time we end their little parade. Once and for all."

  MSR_Crushing_The_Rebellion:0 "Crushing any Rebellion"
  MSR_Crushing_The_Rebellion_desc:0 "With every major opposition leader exiled or dead, dealing with the remaining pockets of rebellion will be a piece of cake. Soon nopony will stand in my way of achieving total control."

  MSR_Cementing_Controls:0 "Cementing Control"
  MSR_Cementing_Controls_desc:0 "There is nothing left standing in my way. I am the undisputed Elder. It may have been a bloody couple of months, but it was all worth it. Soon all within the Manehattan ruins shall learn to fear the name River Autumn."

  ### River Autumn Extended - Deposime Path ###

  MSR_Steel_Rangers_No_More:0 "Steel Rangers No More"
  MSR_Steel_Rangers_No_More_desc:0 "With power now firmly in my hooves, I can finally do away with the Steel Rangers. No more shall their technophilic ways taint this region and destroy that which wishes to thrive. By the time I am done, the only thing that will be left of them to be remembered will be a few pieces of tattered cloth."

  MSR_A_Nation_Reborn:0 "A Nation Reborn"
  MSR_A_Nation_Reborn_desc:0 "It is time for Equestria to rise from the ashes once more. With the Manehattan Steel Rangers all but a memory and power firmly in my control, nothing can stand in my way of achieving greatness."

  MSR_Rebuild_Our_Industry:0 "Rebuild our Industry"
  MSR_Rebuild_Our_Industry_desc:0 "The conflict caused by my sudden ascension to Elder has done quite a number on our economy. Production has all but ceased and many of the facilities are in various states of damage. If I want to turn this nation into a true wasteland powerhouse we are going to need to have a functioning industrial base."

  MSR_Giving_Out_Aid:0 "Giving Out Aid"
  MSR_Giving_Out_Aid_desc:0 "To help secure the legitimacy of the New Equestrian Enclave within the wasteland, we need to start improving our nation's image. Luckily for us, there are hundreds of ponies living in Bucklyn who would be more than grateful to have somepony come along and help prop them up."

  MSR_Outlaw_Slavery:0 "Outlaw Slavery"
  MSR_Outlaw_Slavery_desc:0 "It seems one of the easiest ways to garner large swaths of support within the wasteland is to become a 'liberator of the oppressed:' To fight against those who wish to enslave others for personal use. If that is what it takes to gain popular support, then I guess that is what the New Equestrian Enclave shall become."

  MSR_Healthcare_For_All:0 "Healthcare for All"
  MSR_Healthcare_For_All_desc:0 "Free healthcare may seem like a giant waste of resources to almost anypony with half a brain, but I say otherwise. Making sure that everypony who lives in the New Equestrian Enclave has access to proper medical care will ensure that they will always be fit for military or labor service."

  MSR_Project_Purity:0 "Project Purity"
  MSR_Project_Purity_desc:0 "I have been told on numerous occasions that this will be a massive waste of resources. Building so many water purification plants and then freely distrubuting water seems ludicrous. However, if this project succeeds, the support I gain will grow beyond what anypony could have dreamed of."

  MSR_New_Construction_Methods:0 "New Construction Methods"
  MSR_New_Construction_Methods_desc:0 "The Great War destroyed many old-world ideas; one of which being standardized construction methods. Trying to go and find many of the old-world construction methods would most likely be a waste of time. Instead of trying to do that, we will just create our own construction methods."

  MSR_Product_For_Civilians:0 "Products for Civilians"
  MSR_Product_For_Civilians_desc:0 "Making sure that the civilian population has consumer products for them to buy will not only help to strengthen our economy, but it will also help to distract them from some of the unsavory things that happen around here."

  MSR_Guns_For_Soldiers:0 "Guns for Soldiers"
  MSR_Guns_For_Soldiers_desc:0 "Ensuring that every soldier is properly equipped to fight for our cause should trump all other arguments. The readiness of our nation's armed forces should always be at the forefront of every citizen's mind."

  MSR_Factories_For_The_Future:0 "Factories for the Future"
  MSR_Factories_For_The_Future_desc:0 "You can never have enough factories producing goods for the state. Otherwise the demand for products by the common citizen will be sated. Therefore, through storing away the needed materials and equipment, we will ensure that we are always prepared for when the need for new factories arises."

  MSR_Rebuild_The_Roads:0 "Rebuilding the Roads"
  MSR_Rebuild_The_Roads_desc:0 "Roads are the veins of any functional society. They allow vital supplies to quickly get from point A to B. Although all of Equestria's original roads have decayed beyond usability, we now have ample supplies to begin both repairing the old roads and building new ones."

  MSR_Standardize_Production:0 "Standardize Production"
  MSR_Standardize_Production_desc:0 "For too long we have been reliant on any old-world equipment we could get out hooves on. Initially, this was helpful when we only had to focus on rebuilding old-world technology. But now that our economy is rapidly growing we need to begin standardizing production in order to keep up with the ever-increasing demand."

  MSR_Create_New_Labor_Laws:0 "Create New Labor Laws"
  MSR_Create_New_Labor_Laws_desc:0 "I believe that ensuring the rights of every working pony is essential to our nation's survival. More importantly, I also hold that fooling the workers into believe they have rights is also paramount to keeping my power. In order to maintain this delicate balance, I will create some 'Labor Law's' in order to appease the masses."

  MSR_A_New_Equestrian_Economy:0 "A New Equestrian Economy"
  MSR_A_New_Equestrian_Economy_desc:0 "The New Equestrian Enclave cannot survive on wasteland economics any longer. Our continuous growth has created the need for new economic ideas and policies that will help to keep up with our nation's ever increasing demands."

  MSR_Industrial_Hearland_Reborn:0 "Industrial Heartland Reborn"
  MSR_Industrial_Hearland_Reborn_desc:0 "Not in the past 200 years has a nation become such a powerhouse within the ruins of Manehattan. Our economy has reached that of a small pre-war country, while our position within the wasteland has grown far beyond what even the Steel Rangers could dream of. If we can keep this momentum going, we could soon begin to rival the likes of Red Eye and his Slavers."

  MSR_Expanding_Our_Borders:0 "Expanding Our Borders"
  MSR_Expanding_Our_Borders_desc:0 "Our current position is pitiful. We are trapped within the ruins of Bucklyn with barely any room to stand, while struggling daily to gather enough resources to get by. If we want to truly call ourselves a nation, we must increase the amount of living space we have."

  MSR_Sacking_The_Empire:0 "Sacking Empire"
  MSR_Sacking_The_Empire_desc:0 "Empire has sat comfortably against our north-western border for quite some time now. Their vast swaths of land and resources silently mocking us. It is time we march into their lands and take what should rightfully be ours."

  MSR_Raining_No_More:0 "Raining No More"
  MSR_Raining_No_More_desc:0 "The Rain Riders think they are so high and mighty, all because they control the trade routes leading westward. With a large force of raiders and mercenaries, they believe they can defeat any foe that comes their way. Well, we'll see how high and mighty they are after the fire bombs start dropping."

  MSR_A_Free_Trip_to_Freeside:0 "A Free Trip to Freeside"
  MSR_A_Free_Trip_to_Freeside_desc:0 "The Freeside Raiders are more of a nuisance than an actual threat. Their cross-border raids have been so easily repelled that the border guards have starting making games out of it. Sadly, I do think we need to take them for good, even if that puts a damper on some of my soldiers' fun."

  MSR_Clearing_Out_Cannibals:0 "Clearing Out Cannibals"
  MSR_Clearing_Out_Cannibals_desc:0 "Reports have surfaced that there might be cannibals within the settlement of Arbu. An absolutely loathome practice: I hope they aren't true. However, if they are, we've just gained a solid excuse to send the troops in."

  MSR_Pushing_Towards_Portshoof:0 "Pushing Towards Portshoof"
  MSR_Pushing_Towards_Portshoof_desc:0 "Portshoof has become quite the center for trade. The vast amount of resources moving in and out of their markets is quite impressive. Such a shame that we will be confiscating it all."

  MSR_Taking_Stable_29:0 "Taking Stable 29"
  MSR_Taking_Stable_29_desc:0 "Stable 29 has always been of a place of great interest to the Steel Rangers, especially to Elder Cottage Cheese. If I wish to find out what was keeping the late Elder up every night, I will have to also deal with the Raiders the occupy the area around it."

  MSR_Crossing_Into_Marelem:0 "Crossing into Marelem"
  MSR_Crossing_Into_Marelem_desc:0 "Marelem sits right across the pond from us, quietly waiting for somepony to aid them against their raider neighbors. That day has come. The New Equestrian Enclave will gladly stand up and protect them so long as they submit to us."

  MSR_Dinner_In_Tenpony:0 "Dinner at Tenpony"
  MSR_Dinner_In_Tenpony_desc:0 "Tenpony is quite a sight to see in the wasteland. And with how much they have to offer for those that can afford it, annexing them could provide quite a nice place for me to dine along with fellow officers and politicians."

  MSR_Moving_To_End_Friendship:0 "Moving to End Friendship"
  MSR_Moving_To_End_Friendship_desc:0 "Friendship City has always served as a safe haven for those that wish to try and escape the horrors of the wasteland. As much as I admire what they are doing to help those in need, I also don't like seeing others trying to outdo my work."

  MSR_Eastward_Expansion:0 "Westward Expansion"
  MSR_Eastward_Expansion_desc:0 "West of our territories lie a number of tribes who seem to only bumble about rather than do anything worthwhile. Only through conquest can these backward nations hope to become civilized and useful."

  MSR_March_Along_the_Coast:0 "Shadow over Sunrise"
  MSR_March_Along_the_Coast_desc:0 "The Sunrise region of the Equestrian Wasteland is home to a number of varying nations who claim ownership of its lands. Such a pity that none of these nations know that, I too, lay claim to their lands."

  MSR_Send_in_The_Peace_Keepers:0 "Send in the Peacekeepers"
  MSR_Send_in_The_Peace_Keepers_desc:0 "It seems like not everypony appreciates being told that they are now part of the New Equestrian Enclave. It's almost like they want to keep scraping by without any ensurance of their survival. If they want to speak out against all the good things we are doing for them, then I will just have to show them how I deal with dissent."

  MSR_Stirring_Up_Trouble:0 "Stirring Up Trouble"
  MSR_Stirring_Up_Trouble_desc:0 "It seems like a new threat has begun to rub against our borders. This stallion, Red Eye, and his army of slavers are possibly the biggest threat we have ever seen. This will be our greatest challenge yet and we must use every advantage we can get if we hope to defeat them. Lucky for us, I think I have an idea."

  MSR_Ending_Red_Eyes_Reign:0 "Ending Red Eye's Reign"
  MSR_Ending_Red_Eyes_Reign_desc:0 "With our forces now in position and the rebels now properly armed, it is time to bring an end to Red Eye's parade. If we can win this war, nothing will stand in my way of achieving greatness."

  MSR_Freeing_the_Enslaved_desc:0 "As I drive around Red Eye's former territories, I am greeted by the cheers and admiration of his former slaves. They view me as their hero in the wastes; a messiah sent to free them from their shackles. It fills my heart with laughter knowing that they think that they are truly free under my rule. I won't say anything, though. I'd hate to spoil their fun."

  MSR_Meeting_Old_Friends:0 "Meeting Old Friends"
  MSR_Meeting_Old_Friends_desc:0 "It seems that the Fillydelphia Steel Rangers have managed to survive, even after all that has happened around them. Maybe I should go and pay them a visit, just to see how they are doing."

  MSR_Retaking_the_Heartland:0 "Retaking the Heartland"
  MSR_Retaking_the_Heartland_desc:0 "The New Equestrian Enclave stands on top. No other nation dares to threaten us. Our recent territorial gains have given us vast quantities of resources and ponypower which will help to further my goals. With our position in the wasteland better than ever before, it is time to for us to move to the final stage of my ultimate plan: retaking all of Equestria."

  MSR_A_New_Equestrian_Army:0 "A New Equestrian Army"
  MSR_A_New_Equestrian_Army_desc:0 "My forces are currently poorly organized, under trained, and barely disciplined. My only saving grace being that the majority of them are former Steel Ranger veterans. If we want to be able to stand hoof to hoof with those around us, I am going to have to reorganize my forces into a proper army."

  MSR_A_Organized_Army:0 "An Organized Army"
  MSR_A_Organized_Army_desc:0 "A well organized and well-equipped army stands above all who face it. Making sure every soldier has a proper rifle and equipment should be our top priority in the face of war."

  MSR_Infantry_Support_Weapons:0 "Infantry Support Weapons"
  MSR_Infantry_Support_Weapons_desc:0 "It would be wise to make sure that each of our divisions are properly supported. From medics to machine guns; maintenance to artillery. These Combat Support and Combat Service Support teams will be crucial in making sure our soldiers can stay in the fight."

  MSR_Raining_Fire:0 "Raining Fire"
  MSR_Raining_Fire_desc:0 "Thanks to our ever-expanding industrial base, we have begun the production of new Artillery guns that will surely turn the tables in our favor.

  MSR_An_Highly_Mobile_Army:0 "A Highly Mobile Army"
  MSR_An_Highly_Mobile_Army_desc:0 "A force that is quick enough to react to any situation is crucial to waging wars in the wasteland. These motorized units will be able to outpace any foot soldier while still maintaining combat effectiveness."

  MSR_Putting_Guns_On_Trucks:0 "Putting Guns on Trucks"
  MSR_Putting_Guns_On_Trucks_desc:0 "Some of our soldiers have decided to add steel plates and heavy machine guns to some of the old trucks we have been repairing. At first it seemed like a waste of resources, but after reading about how well they have performed, I think it is time I gave them another look."

  MSR_Beasts_of_Steel:0 "Beasts of Steel"
  MSR_Beasts_of_Steel_desc:0 "Tanks were once considered to be an essential part of modern warfare, but thanks to the Great War, they are nothing more that massive scrap heaps. However, now that our industrial base has grown quite a considerable size we could bring life back into these steel beasts."

  MSR_Hiring_New_Generals:0 "Hiring New Generals"
  MSR_Hiring_New_Generals_desc:0 "Thanks to those little purges of mine, we are entirely lacking a competent command staff. And as much as we are in need of a number of high ranking officers, I would rather not just start promoting random soldiers. Luckily, some of my contacts have informed me of some potential candidates that might just fit the bill."

  MSR_Office_of_Internal_Integrity_desc:0 "There will always be those who wish to speak out against, protest against, or even attempt to overthrow me.

  MSR_Keeping_the_Peace:0 "Keeping the Peace"
  MSR_Keeping_the_Peace_desc:0 "With threats looming around every corner, trying to ensure that peace is maintained within the state is going to be difficult to achieve. To remedy this, a specialized unit of enforcers have been created to deal with any major threat thrown their way.

  MSR_Service_Gurantees_Citizenship_desc:0 "We can't just have anypony be considered a citizen of the New Equestrian Enclave. We only want the best. And only through serving the needs of the state could one even fathom the idea of becoming a citizen. Becoming a citizen should be considered a privilege and never something taken for granted."

  MSR_Deployment_Groups:0 "Deployment Groups"
  MSR_Deployment_Groups_desc:0 "As much as I resented how much the Steel Rangers worshiped power armor, one can't ignore how useful it is in combat.

  MSR_Going_In_Guns_Blazing:0 "Going in Guns Blazing"
  MSR_Going_In_Guns_Blazing_desc:0 "Power armor is far from ideal for conducting operations behind enemy lines. The best we can do is have the units show up at a strategic location and start gunning down anything that moves. It may not be the best plan of action for these units, but they can still do some good for the war effort."

  MSR_Vertibuck_Assault_Teams:0 "Vertibuck Assault Teams"
  MSR_Vertibuck_Assault_Teams_desc:0 "To help increase the effectiveness of our deployment groups, we have allotted them the use of some of our recently built Vertibucks.

  MSR_Special_Intervention_Force:0 "Special Intervention Force"
  MSR_Special_Intervention_Force_desc:0 "Power armor may make oneself a walking tank, but when it comes to conducting special or covert operations, it is pretty much useless. What we need instead are specially designated, organized, trained, and equipped forces who can use unconventional means to wage war against our enemies."

  MSR_Asymmetric_Warfare:0 "Asymmetric Warfare"
  MSR_Asymmetric_Warfare_desc:0 "The Special Intervention Force knows that no amount of training or top of the line equipment will save them if they get into a fierce firefight. That is why every member in this unit is taught to use everything in their environment to aid in the battle, no matter how cruel or unusual it may be."

  MSR_Long_Range_Wasteland_Group:0 "Long Range Wasteland Group"
  MSR_Long_Range_Wasteland_Group_desc:0 "Conducting operations outside our borders is in no way an easy task. These long-range special operations units will do everything within their power to make sure that any outside threat to this nation is swiftly dealt with.

  MSR_Army_of_Freedom:0 "Army of \"Freedom\""
  MSR_Army_of_Freedom_desc:0 "Never before has a military force of such standing professionalism been seen within the Wasteland.

  ### Steelhooves Intro - Survialism/Visionary Path ##

  MSR_Hooves:0 "Steelhooves Becomes Elder"
  MSR_Hooves_desc:0 "The provisional council has chosen Steelhooves as the new Elder of the Manehattan Contingent. Many members are surprised by this, but some are hopeful that he will lead them into a brighter tomorrow."

  MSR_Hold_Speech:0 "Hold a Speech"
  MSR_Hold_Speech_desc:0 "I am not one to give speeches, but I was told this might help to ease some of the tension building up. Let's just hope I don't mess this one up."

  MSR_Talk_With_Paladins:0 "Talk with the Paladins"
  MSR_Talk_With_Paladins_desc:0 "Many of the Paladins within this contingent weren't too happy when they heard that I was chosen as their next Elder. I think it would be wise to talk with them before they do something brash."

  MSR_Meet_With_Scribes:0 "Meet with the Scribes"
  MSR_Meet_With_Scribes_desc:0 "The scribes have always been important to the politics of the Steel Rangers but they've always been focused more on their work than what's going on around them. If I could convince them to support me, it could help in legitimizing my position."

  MSR_Exile_Extremists:0 "Exile the Extremists"
  MSR_Exile_Extremists_desc:0 "The Steel Rangers has always been home to a number of unsavory characters who would rather do as they please without interference. I can't allow these types within our ranks and know that we must rid ourselves of them before they attempt to push back. It will be tough to let so many Rangers go, but it must be done if we wish to change who we are."

  MSR_Rid_The_Old_Ways:0 "Rid of the Old Ways"
  MSR_Rid_The_Old_Ways_desc:0 "The old ways have held us back for a long time. They've prevented us from becoming something more. From our distrust of outsiders to our complete obsession with technology, there's always been something that hindered our potential. It is time we rid ourselves of these ideals and look toward something new."

  MSR_Rally_The_Rangers:0 "Rally the Steel Rangers"
  MSR_Rally_The_Rangers_desc:0 "With the majority of the Manehattan contingent on my side, it is time we rally them to our cause; only then can we begin to bring change to the Steel Rangers. The road ahead is going to be a difficult one and there will be many obstacles in our way. If we stand united, however, we shall endure anything that comes our way."

  MSR_Break_The_Chains:0 "Break the Chains"
  MSR_Break_The_Chains_desc:0 "The 'Chain That Binds' is something that only brought more harm than good, even when in it was implemented. My years in the military showed me that a flexible command structure works more efficiently than one that is rigid."

  MSR_Change_Our_Approach:0 "Change our Approach"
  MSR_Change_Our_Approach_desc:0 "Whenever we dealt with any kind of situation our approach always seemed to barge in and do as we please. I think it is time we find a more diplomatic approach to solving an issue and only start barging in when that option has truly failed."

  MSR_Our_Original_Mission:0 "Our Original Mission"
  MSR_Our_Original_Mission_desc:0 "We turned away almost any outsider who begged for our help because they weren't one of us. We refused to shelter those who needed protection and left them to fend for themselves. I say: no more! For the first time in almost 200 years, we shall cast aside what made us who we are and find a new purpose in life. From this day forth we shall dedicate ourselves to our original mission: protecting the ponies of Equestria from those who wish to do them harm."

  ### Steelhooves Route ###

  MSR_Steel_Rangers_Reborn:0 "Steel Rangers Reborn"
  MSR_Steel_Rangers_Reborn_desc:0 "If we wish to try and distance ourselves from the Steel Rangers, we must come up with a new name for ourselves. I believe I have an idea that will not only honor our oaths to Equestria, but the mare that helped to create us."

  MSR_Allow_More_Outsiders:0 "Allow More Outsiders"
  MSR_Allow_More_Outsiders_desc:0 "There have been many ponies that have come to us, eager to join. Because of our policies against outsiders, we turned them away. However, after talking to some of the members of this contingent, I have found it unnecessary to continue this policy. From now on we will allow any able-bodied ponies into our ranks as fully fledged members of the Applejack's Rangers."

  MSR_Open_Up_Outside_Relations:0 "Open Up Outside Relations"
  MSR_Open_Up_Outside_Relations_desc:0 "We have isolated ourselves for too long and the strain on resources is beginning to show itself. It would be wise to form relations with outside settlements if we wish to survive. We need to get the ball rolling on this, as it may take some time for settlements to agree to the idea of trading with us."

  MSR_Increase_Patrols:0 "Increase Patrols"
  MSR_Increase_Patrols_desc:0 "Before, patrol groups only patrolled the area immediately around Bucklyn Cross. I believe it prudent to not only increase the number of patrols we have but also extend the area in which they patrol. This would allow us to more effectively deter raider attacks while also showing the local wastelanders that we are there to protect them."

  MSR_Protecting_Wastelanders:0 "Protecting Wastelanders"
  MSR_Protecting_Wastelanders_desc:0 "It seems our work is starting to pay off. Ponies in and around the Bucklyn area have begun to thank us for our service to them. With this initial success, I feel it is a good time to begin dispatching groups of Rangers to actively helping any wastelander that is moving through our territory. Hopefully this will continue to show outsiders that we can be trusted."

  MSR_Support_Local_Settlement:0 "Support Local Settlements"
  MSR_Support_Local_Settlement_desc:0 "With the success we are seeing in helping those within our territorial borders, many nearby settlements have asked us to help support them against possible raids. I didn't expect them to reach out to us so quickly, but that doesn't mean it is a bad thing. I am just happy that they are starting to see us as a group to seek help from."

  MSR_Incentivize_Trade:0 "Incentivize Trade"
  MSR_Incentivize_Trade_desc:0 "Trade talks have begun but are moving at a snail's pace. Nearby settlements are still unwilling to conduct major trade with us, as they feel we don't have much to offer them. Because of this, I have authorized that we allow the trade of some of our nonessential tech for these much-needed resources."

  MSR_Support_Local_Caravans:0 "Support Local Caravans"
  MSR_Support_Local_Caravans_desc:0 "With trade now growing between us and a number of outside settlements, it would be wise to start giving out support for some of the caravans that help us conduct our business. If we show them how much we appreciate their work, they will be more likely to continue operating with us."

  MSR_Become_A_Force_For_Good:0 "Becoming a Force for Good"
  MSR_Become_A_Force_For_Good_desc:0 "It is high time we truly show the wasteland that we are a force for good. No longer will we bring unwarranted harm to those who peacefully cross our paths. From here on out, we will strive to show the wasteland that there is still good within the heart of every Equestrian."

  MSR_A_Fork_In_The_Road:0 "A Fork in the Road"
  MSR_A_Fork_In_The_Road_desc:0 "Even though so much good has been done by the Applejack Rangers, there is still a lot of work to do. However, I am unsure if I want to continue doing all this work. I need some time to think."

  MSR_Manehattan_Treaty_Organization:0 "Manehattan Treaty Organization"
  MSR_Manehattan_Treaty_Organization_desc:0 "With how harsh the Equestrian Wasteland can be, the idea of a multi-settlement treaty organization centered within the ruins of Manehattan could benefit many. With this type of treaty organization, we could ensure both military and economic cooperation with those who wish to join. It won't be easy to create. However, with enough time it could bring stability to this region."

  MSR_Offer_Membership_To_Others:0 "Offer Membership to Others"
  MSR_Offer_Membership_To_Others_desc:0 "With the charter draft and the paperwork almost complete, it is now time to move to the next step of this plan. We will send out a number of envoys to some of the surrounding settlements, asking if they wish to join the MTO. Hopefully we can gain a few new member-settlements."

  MSR_Create_A_Mutual_Defense_Pact:0 "Create a Mutual Defense Pact"
  MSR_Create_A_Mutual_Defense_Pact_desc:0 "Now that we have a number of member-settlement in the MTO, it is time to gather the representatives of each settlement and start getting to work. Our first order of business is to ensure that each settlement is ready in the event that another member-state is attacked. Because if one state is attacked, all states are attacked."

  MSR_Joint_Military_Exercises:0 "Joint Military Exercises"
  MSR_Joint_Military_Exercises_desc:0 "In order to make sure that each settlement is ready for the event of a sudden invasion, we have devised a number of joint military exercises to be conducted. It will be hard on them at first, as many of these settlements have never had anything more than a militia force to protect them. By the time we are done, those militia forces will come ready to face anything."

  MSR_Aid_In_Re_Industrialization:0 "Aid in Re-Industrialization"
  MSR_Aid_In_Re_Industrialization_desc:0 "Assisting with the construction of industry within each member-settlement is major factor in ensuring their survival. Therefore, we have agreed to lend a number of our scribes to help the settlements understand what it will take to create an industrial base from scratch."

  MSR_Manehattan_Recovery_Program:0 "Manehattan Recovery Program"
  MSR_Manehattan_Recovery_Program_desc:0 "The survival of each member-settlement is key to the survival of the MTO as a whole. Because of this, we have decided to lend whatever resources we can spare to every member-settlement. It may put a strain on our resources for some time, but it will benefit all of us greatly in the long run."

  MSR_Keeping_The_Flame:0 "Keeping the Flame"
  MSR_Keeping_The_Flame_desc:0 "There is still so much that can be done to improve the situation within Manehattan. I can't stop, won't stop, until I ensure that the safety of all who live here is guaranteed."

  MSR_Carrying_On_A_Memory:0 "Carrying on a Memory"
  MSR_Carrying_On_A_Memory_desc:0 "Though Applejack is all but a memory for me now, her dream of helping those in need still resides within. I never realized the good we could have done if we followed her example instead of hiding away. It is time we carry that dream in honor of her, so that its message can be seen by all of the Equestrian Wasteland."

  MSR_Talk_With_Crossroads:0 "Talk with Crossroads"
  MSR_Talk_With_Crossroads_desc:0 "Crossroads has been very vocal about her animosity towards some of the decisions I have made. She says that the Applejack's Rangers are changing too rapidly, causing us to alienate many former Steel Rangers. I understand her concerns, and I will have to discuss with her that change comes with a cost, but the benefit always outweighs it. Hopefully she'll agree."

  MSR_Remember_Our_Oaths:0 "Remember Our Oaths"
  MSR_Remember_Our_Oaths_desc:0 "When the Steel Rangers were first created, we all took an oath. It stated that we would protect and defend Equestria and its citizens. Since the Great War, that oath has been lost to time, replaced with a more twisted version. For too long we have followed this false oath and it is high time we rid ourselves of it and return to our roots. It is time we remember our oaths to Equestria and, once again, swear to protect her. Even in her darkest hour."

  MSR_Embracing_Outsiders:0 "Embracing Outsiders"
  MSR_Embracing_Outsiders_desc:0 "We have had outsiders within our ranks for some time now, but it seems like there are still some who hold animosity towards them. It is shameful to see so called 'Brothers in Hooves' distrust one another and put their lives in possible jeopardy. We must show them that these outsiders are not only to be trusted, but embraced, as if they were an old friend."

  MSR_The_Spirit_Of_Honesty:0 "The Spirit of Honesty"
  MSR_The_Spirit_Of_Honesty_desc:0 "Applejack represented the spirit of honesty as she was always willing to tell the truth, no matter what. She went above and beyond to help not just her friends, but anypony that needed help. If we want to continue to show the wasteland that the Applejack's Rangers are their friends, we must strive to follow her example."

  MSR_An_Unwavering_Vision:0 "An Unwavering Vision"
  MSR_An_Unwavering_Vision_desc:0 "We have come so far in the past couple of years, more than I thought we ever would. Our fledgling organization, built from the ashes of the Steel Rangers, has become a beacon of hope within the wasteland. No more will the ponies of the wasteland be fearful of what may lay around the corner, as we will be there to help them along the way. There is still a long road ahead of us, but I believe that if we stay true to our vision, nothing will stand in our way."

  MSR_Investigate_Arbu:0 "Investigate Arbu"
  MSR_Investigate_Arbu_desc:0 "Some of our scouts have begun to notice strange things occurring at Arbu. Let's hope their post-op reports can shed some light on the situation."

  MSR_Take_Out_The_Empire:0 "Take Out Empire"
  MSR_Take_Out_The_Empire_desc:0 "Empire's power within the Manhattan region has been growing for quite some time. Their forces have lined against our borders and threatened our sovereignty in the past. Because of this, we had put plans in place to preemptively strike their positions with the hopes of taking their forces out in one fell swoop."

  MSR_Crush_The_Manehattan_Raiders:0 "Crush the Manehattan Raiders"
  MSR_Crush_The_Manehattan_Raiders_desc:0 "The Manhattan Raiders have been a threat in the region for too long. Their blatant disregard for pony life is something we won't let stand. It is high time that the swift hoof of justice is brought down on them and their reign of terror ended."

  MSR_Deal_With_The_Rain_Raiders:0 "Deal with the Rain Riders"
  MSR_Deal_With_The_Rain_Raiders_desc:0 "The Rain Riders continue to be a danger to anypony traveling within the area. If we wish to ensure the safety of all travelers coming to the Manehattan ruins, we will have to take them out for good."

  MSR_Passing_The_Torch:0 "Passing the Torch"
  MSR_Passing_The_Torch_desc:0 "It was unexpected to say the least; I never thought I would even be considered for elder. But with how fast thing are changing around here, some are looking towards me as a voice of reason. It will be tough task to endure, but hopefully by then end of it, I can bring some balance back to the Applejack's Rangers."

  MSR_Necessary_Compromise:0 "Necessary Compromise"
  MSR_Necessary_Compromise_desc:0 "Steelhooves may have initially had the right idea; working to make the Steel Rangers a force for good. But he tried to change too many things too quickly, causing rifts to form within our ranks. If we wish to keep ourselves from collapsing, I need to make some compromises to appease the hardline groups."

  MSR_Realism_Not_Idealism:0 "Realism, Not Idealism"
  MSR_Realism_Not_Idealism_desc:0 "Steelhooves was so focused on changing the Steel Rangers into something new that he lost sight of what was going on in front of him. His new policies were pushing away many of his former supporters while forcing us to give up more of our resources. Though his intentions were noble they were in no way grounded in reality."

  MSR_Remember_Our_Mission:0 "Remember Our Mission"
  MSR_Remember_Our_Mission_desc:0 "We cannot hold ourselves to such old-world ideas. As much as our oaths still hold meaning to our cause, they also have us swear loyalty for a nation that does not exist anymore. The only thing we can hold ourselves to now is collecting and securing harmful technology from those who wish to use it for malice."

  MSR_Bring_Back_The_Outcasts:0 "Bring Back the Outcasts"
  MSR_Bring_Back_The_Outcasts_desc:0 "When Steelhooves began reforming the Steel Rangers into the Applejack's Rangers, he forced a large number of non-supporters out. In doing this, we lost a lot of ponies with both valuable skill and equipment. Steelhooves was far too harsh on many of them, and most should be allowed to return, if they so desire."

  MSR_The_Supremacy_Of_Steel:0 "The Supremacy of Steel"
  MSR_The_Supremacy_Of_Steel_desc:0 "The Equestrian Wasteland is unforgiving and steel, not honesty, is the best policy within the wasteland. It takes more than sharing your true emotions to survive: you need guts, grits, and a lot of guns. We are called the Steel Rangers for a reason, and it wasn't because we shared our feelings with each other."

  MSR_A_Reasonable_View:0 "A Reasonable View"
  MSR_A_Reasonable_View_desc:0 "Steelhooves thought that he could bring forth change in a matter of weeks, but all it did was divide us even more. If I not had been chosen to be Elder when I did, the Applejack's Rangers would not have lasted more than a year. I may not be as idealistic as Steelhooves, but I have still set the Applejack Rangers on the right path."

  MSR_Bucklyn_Defense_Initiative:0 "Bucklyn Defense Initiative"
  MSR_Bucklyn_Defense_Initiative_desc:0 "The need to protect ourselves is great, but something we can't do alone. Even with all the changes we have enacted, we are still not the most liked group within the wasteland. I think it is high time we create a defense initiative to ensure the safety of Bucklyn."

  MSR_Convince_Others_To_Join:0 "Convince Others to Join"
  MSR_Convince_Others_To_Join_desc:0 "In order for this initiative to succeed, we need other settlements to act as buffer states for us. But that requires them to willingly joins us. That something they might not agree to. To remedy that, we'll make sure that they won't have any kind of a choice in the matter."

  MSR_Offer_Military_Protection_desc:0 "Now that we were able to 'convince' all of these settlements to join our little defense pact, we can begin to move troops into their territories. This is to ensure that our 'allies' are properly protected from any outside threat. It would be a shame to see them get pushed over by some raider group, now wouldn't it?"

  MSR_Create_A_Technology_Tax:0 "Create a Technology Tax"
  MSR_Create_A_Technology_Tax_desc:0 "With the safety of our 'allies' ensured, we can begin to focus on creating some reforms. Our first order of business is to institute a technology tax within their territories. This will be to help compensate for the fact that we are deploying so many of our Rangers outside of Bucklyn. It will in no way hurt their economic situation, as long as they comply."

  MSR_Seize_Illegal_Technology:0 "Seize \"Illegal\" Technology"
  MSR_Seize_Illegal_Technology_desc:0 "Seems like some of our 'allies' have been secretly hoarding technology from us. This will not do at all. How are we supposed to trust each other if them do things like this? Looks like I am going to have to send some Rangers in to seize these stockpiles and ensure that our allies don't go behind my back again."

  MSR_Occupy_Strategic_Locations:0 "Occupy Strategic Locations"
  MSR_Occupy_Strategic_Locations_desc:0 "It has been confirmed that some of our 'allies' have locations of strategic importance within their territories. These locations could prove useful to us given that we are allowed to take them over. It should be a relatively simple task, but we must also be prepared regardless. In case they refuse."

  ### Industry Recover ###

  MSR_A_City_In_Ruins:0 "A City in Ruins"
  MSR_A_City_In_Ruins_desc:0 "Manehattan was once one of the largest centers of trade and commerce in Equestria. Now it sits in ruin, slowly wasting away. It's about time somepony changed that. Thanks to our technological know-how and military might, we will begin to rebuild this glorified junk yard into a prosperous community."

  MSR_Repairing_Bucklyn_Cross:0 "Repairing Bucklyn Cross"
  MSR_Repairing_Bucklyn_Cross_desc:0 "Bucklyn Cross may be our home, but it is also a logistical nightmare. Almost every road in and out of the area is covered by some sort of hazard. If we wish to be able to carry out operations with relative ease, we need to make sure our supply and communication lines are fully open to us."

  MSR_Securing_Bucklyn_Proper:0 "Securing Bucklyn Proper"
  MSR_Securing_Bucklyn_Proper_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our supply routes within Bucklyn Cross, it would be wise to move towards cleaning up Bucklyn proper. Doing so would allow us to not only expand our area of operation within Manehattan, but also expand our ability to trade."

  MSR_Rebuilding_Rail_Lines:0 "Rebuilding the Rail Lines"
  MSR_Rebuilding_Rail_Lines_desc:0 "Bucklyn was once home to a system of commuter trains that allowed ponies to move around the city with ease. There is much potential if we could find a way to repair these rails lines. Doing so would not only increase our ability to move supplies around, but also allow for the rapid deployment of our troops."

  MSR_Arms_Salvaging:0 "Arms Salvaging"
  MSR_Arms_Salvaging_desc:0 "A Steel Ranger is nothing more than a glorified civilian without their equipment. In order to make sure each and every one is properly armed and equipped, we must increase our efforts in salvaging pre-war military warehouses."

  MSR_Hiring_Weaponsmith:0 "Hiring Weaponsmiths"
  MSR_Hiring_Weaponsmith_desc:0 "As our military strength continues to grow so does our need for more equipment. Scavenging isn't going to meet our expanding needs like it once did. To fill this growing need, we have begun to hire weaponsmiths to aid in the production of new equipment."

  MSR_Vigilant_Recycling:0 "Vigilant Recycling"
  MSR_Vigilant_Recycling_desc:0 "Waste not, want not. From toasters to broken MEWs, every piece of scrap technology can be broken down into useable parts. To ensure that we will never be wanting of vital components, we shall recycle every bit of broken technology we encounter."

  MSR_Foundries_Of_Steel:0 "Foundries of Steel"
  MSR_Foundries_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Our military-industrial complex has grown to such a point that not even the weaponsmiths can keep up. On order to remedy this, we have begun converting some of the old factories into centers of arms production. Never again will we have to scavenge the leftovers of the old world for new equipment."

  MSR_Metailurgy_Reborn:0 "Metallurgy Reborn"
  MSR_Metailurgy_Reborn_desc:0 "As the Steel Rangers continue to grow so does our need for more advanced metals. Luckily for us, we have been able to find a number of holotapes containing information on the science of metallurgy. Thanks to these, we should be able to produce more refined alloys."

  MSR_Stripping_World_Facilities:0 "Stripping Old-World Facilities"
  MSR_Stripping_World_Facilities_desc:0 "If we are to produce more advanced equipment, we must maintain a large stockpile of advanced components. However, the only way to do that is by stripping every pre-war government complex and research facility we find. It will be highly dangerous work, but our need for these parts outweigh the risks."

  MSR_Back_Yard_Forages:0 "Back Yard Forges"
  MSR_Back_Yard_Forages_desc:0 "If we wish to continue our efforts in rebuilding Manehattan, we need to first build up an industrial base. Though it will start off rather small, given enough time we could soon turn Manehattan back into the industrial center of Equestria."

  MSR_Civilian_Labor_Corp:0 "Civilian Labor Corp"
  MSR_Civilian_Labor_Corp_desc:0 "There are a number of ponies who have made their way to Manehattan in the hopes of seeking shelter with us. Athough we loath the idea of doing charity work, a number of these ponies hold skills that we are sorely lacking in. Because of this, we have begun to hire them on to complete projects that our own scribes couldn't care less about."

  MSR_City_Of_Steel:0 "City of Steel"
  MSR_City_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Bucklyn, even in the ruined state it is, can still serve a great purpose to us. Many of the old structures were made from a multitude of metals that we could easily reuse for our own benefit. Thanks to this, we are certain we will never run out of scrap to use."

  MSR_Rebuilding_Old_Canneries:0 "Repairing the Old Canneries"
  MSR_Rebuilding_Old_Canneries_desc:0 "Reconstruction is going slow, but steady. Our industrial base has taken roots, which has allowed us to look into expanding it. Thankfully, there are some old canneries nearby that are still in decent condition. With a little TLC, we should be able to bring them back into working order."

  MSR_Repairing_The_Generators:0 "Repairing the Generators"
  MSR_Repairing_The_Generators_desc:0 "Electricity is crucial to our survival. It is what keeps the factories running, the communications flowing, and our weapon systems operating. Therefore, to keep up with the ever-increasing demand, we must expand our operations to repair and rebuild any power generator we find."

  MSR_Restoring_Water_Plant:0 "Restoring the Bucklyn Water Plant"
  MSR_Restoring_Water_Plant_desc:0 "The Mare River is by no means a safe source of drinking water. Fortunately, Bucklyn just so happens to be home to a sizable water treatment facility. With a bit of work, we could have it up and running again in no time."

  MSR_Buckyln_Reborn:0 "Bucklyn Reborn"
  MSR_Buckyln_Reborn_desc:0 "It has taken us quite some time, but it was worth all of the hardships. Thanks to the efforts of every Steel Ranger and wasteland volunteer, the once desolate ruins of Bucklyn have been transformed into a thriving community. No longer are we hiding away in Bucklyn Cross, fearful of what lay in the ruins. The days of barely scraping enough supplies together to survive is a distant memory. Our factories produce new equipment for us, while our repaired roads allow for ease of trade with the outside. The industrial might of Equestria is waking once more, and the Steel Rangers shall be there to guide it every step of the way."

  ### Army Tree ###

  MSR_Army_Reorganization:0 "Army Reorganization"
  MSR_Army_Reorganization_desc:0 "Thanks to all the political infighting, our armed forces have become somewhat neglected over the past years. This is something we cannot allow. We must reorganize and reevaluate our forces if we hope to still be able to put up a fight."

  MSR_Combat_Log:0 "Pre-War Combat Logs"
  MSR_Combat_Log_desc:0 "A wise pony once said that 'if one wants to define the future, they must study the past.' Study the past we shall. Our vast collection of pre-war combat logs provide us with valuable information involving numerous types of military engagements. With these logs, we can better understand what the militaries of the past did right and what they did wrong. From there, we should be able to formulate new plans that better fit the battlefields of today."

  MSR_Raider_Wars:0 "Raider Wars"
  MSR_Raider_Wars_desc:0 "Given our plethora resources and weapons we are a prime target for raider factions. Though some of these wars have been costly, they have given us valuable amounts of combat data that we can review. With each new combat log, we can come up better plans and tactics to use against these varying groups."

  MSR_Combat_Simulation:0 "Combat Simulations"
  MSR_Combat_Simulation_desc:0 "Though it will never be as good as experiencing a battle firsthoof, the use of simulations has been a proven military training tactic since before the Great War. And they can still provide us with the necessary training needed if these certain situations are to arise during combat."

  MSR_Reverse_Engineering:0 "Reverse Engineering"
  MSR_Reverse_Engineering_desc:0 "Thanks to the hard work of our scribes, we now have a better understanding of our magical energy weapons. Hopefully this will allow us to better streamline our production of them along with reducing their overall production cost."

  MSR_Old_World:0 "Old World Efficiency"
  MSR_Old_World_desc:0 "Why try to fix something if it isn't broken? That's the thought when it comes to whether we should upgrade our magical energy weapons. We have been using the same MEWs for centuries now and they have more than proved themselves reliable."

  MSR_New_World:0 "New World Design"
  MSR_New_World_desc:0 "Though our MEWs of old have done us well, they are beginning to show their age. Luckily, our scribes have been prototyping an advanced MEW weapon system. This step towards the future is essential to keeping ourselves in the fight, though it does mean we will have to move more resources toward their production."

  MSR_Routine_Maintenance:0 "Routine Maintenance"
  MSR_Routine_Maintenance_desc:0 "Our power armor is centuries old and could easily break down in combat. To try and prevent this, the scribes have implemented a routine maintenance program for all our power armor. With this in place our armor will always be combat ready."

  MSR_Streamlined_Parts:0 "Streamlined Parts"
  MSR_Streamlined_Parts_desc:0 "Some of the scribes have concluded that we could easily streamline the production of power armor, given enough time. This would greatly increase the number of units we can produce. However, it would also decrease the reliability of the power armor as well as compromise some of its integrity."

  MSR_Reinforced_Alloys:0 "Reinforced Alloys"
  MSR_Reinforced_Alloys_desc:0 "Some of the scribes have found a way to reinforce our power armor with a new type of super alloy. With it amalgamated with the power armor, the hull integrity would increase significantly, although it would make producing power armor more costly."

  MSR_PBF:0 "Pony's Best Friend. Reinvented, again."
  MSR_PBF_desc:0 "Robots were once a vital part of the Equestrian war effort. But now many now lie in scrap piles, no better than buckets of rust. It might be beneficial to start looking into researching them once again, as they could prove a valuable asset."

  MSR_Legion_Of_Steel:0 "Legions of Steel"
  MSR_Legion_Of_Steel_desc:0 "Robots are nothing more than the perfect cannon fodder. Make their design simple enough and you could field thousands of them. All one have to do is sit back and watch them soften up the enemy before sending in the more valuable troops in to mop up."

  MSR_Mobile_Weapon_System:0 "Mobile Weapon Systems"
  MSR_Mobile_Weapon_System_desc:0 "Robronco had the right idea when creating heavy assault robots like the sentinels. Their increased armor and complement of weaponry more than outweigh their costly production. Having these mobile tanks on our side would give us a massive advantage on the battlefield."

  MSR_Promoting_Initiates:0 "Promoting Initiates"
  MSR_Promoting_Initiates_desc:0 "With our ponypower reserves starting to falter, we have decided to hasten the promotion of many of our initiates. They may have not fully finished their training, but this influx will hopefully fill in a number of gaps we have. It may not be the most ideal situation, but we don't really have time to bicker about it."

  MSR_Wasteland_Conscription:0 "Wasteland Conscription"
  MSR_Wasteland_Conscription_desc:0 "In order to keep up our strength we need to have a constant flow of new recruits. However, the problem is that the number of our foals coming of age into the Steel Rangers is still low. Because of this, we have authorized the conscription of 'outsiders' who show interest and/or loyalty to us, in the hopes of bolstering our numbers."

  MSR_Multirole_Training:0 "Multirole Training"
  MSR_Multirole_Training_desc:0 "We have recently come across some old military texts that talk about something called 'Multirole Training.' This training was supposed to allow soldiers to do each other's jobs incase certain specialists were 'incapacitated.' With this in mind, we shall immediately begin to implement this 'Multirole Training' for our initiates and knights. Hopefully this will increase the number of combat ready troops we have."

  MSR_Rangers_Lead_The_Way:0 "Rangers Lead the Way"
  MSR_Rangers_Lead_The_Way_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of both the Paladins and Scribes, we have been able to completely overhaul how our armed forces function. They are better trained and better equipped to deal with what the wasteland throws at them. Now nothing can stand in the way of the Steel Rangers. Ad Victoriam!"

  MSR_Taking_To_The_Skies_desc:0 "Pegasi and griffins thought they were the only ones who could tame the sky. Now it is our turn. Thanks to some 'generous' wrecks left behind by the Grand Pegasus Enclave, we have begun work on researching flight for the flightless."

  MSR_Repairing_Old_Airfields:0 "Repairing Old Airfields"
  MSR_Repairing_Old_Airfields_desc:0 "Bucklyn had very little in the way of a functioning air field, as it was only a part of the greater city of Manehattan. However, we got lucky, as the old borough did have a small municipal airport for pre-war civilian craft. With a bit of work we could get it back up and running."

  MSR_Secure_The_Skies:0 "Securing the Skies"
  MSR_Secure_The_Skies_desc:0 "Complete air dominance is key for any military victory, at least it did in the old world. While it may not be the biggest concern today, there is still sound logic to it."

  MSR_Focus_On_Fighters:0 "Focus on Fighters"
  MSR_Focus_On_Fighters_desc:0 "Due to resource constraints, we are greatly limited in our plane production capability. Because of this, we will focus on building fighters over CAS."

  MSR_Dominate_The_Skies:0 "Dominate the Air-War"
  MSR_Dominate_The_Skies_desc:0 "With our air power slowly increasing, no longer will the Pegasi control the sky unabated. Our brand new fighters will soon take to the air, showing that the Steel Rangers are not to be underestimated."

  MSR_Flying_Fortresses:0 "Flying Fortresses"
  MSR_Flying_Fortresses_desc:0 "Fighters are good, but if we really want to get an edge in the air war, we need to go big. Though they may be costly to produce, these airships are just what we need to gain the upper hoof."

  MSR_Support_Our_Troops:0 "Support our Troops"
  MSR_Support_Our_Troops_desc:0 "Undoubtedly, our soldiers are the true concern of any military action. Whether from the ground or from the air, we must make sure they are always supported."

  MSR_Focus_On_CAS:0 "Focus on CAS"
  MSR_Focus_On_CAS_desc:0 "Due to resource constraints, we are greatly limited on our plane production capability. Because of this, we will focus on building CAS over fighters."

  MSR_Death_From_Above:0 "Death from Above"
  MSR_Death_From_Above_desc:0 "Sturdy, accurate, and very effective against ground targets, dive bombers are perfect for dealing with any ground target. Our enemies won't know what hit them as we shower them from above with explosives."

  MSR_Strategic_Bombing:0 "Strategic Bombing"
  MSR_Strategic_Bombing_desc:0 "Sometimes the way to deal with the enemy is to decimate everything that aides their war effort. This is where the genius of strategic bombing comes in. With these on our side, the enemy will surely be crushed."

  MSR_birds_of_steel:0 "Birds of Steel"
  MSR_birds_of_steel_desc:0 "Our air force has come a long way: never did we imagine that we would take to the skies ever again. It is such an amazing sight watching our planes take off towards their target mission. With our pilots covering our backs, we will surely become unstoppable."

  #MSR.1.desc:0 "MSRpony Tower. A luxury hotel, known for housing the Ministry of Arcane Science's ManehatMSR Hub. When Balefire began raining from the sky, those ponies working within the Hub were some of the first to know. Orders came in from Canterlot to fire the prototype megaspell Celestia One at Roam, capital of the Zebra empire. Knowing that ManehatMSR would be a primary target, the ponies of the Ministry had to make a choice. They could follow their orders and focus on casting the megaspell, or ignore their orders and focus on using the ManehatMSR Emergency Broadcasting System to warn the residents of the city. There wouldn't be enough time to do both, and the seconds were ticking down."

  MSR.1.desc:0 "Nopony never expected it to end like this.\n\n200 years ago, the 21st Powered Armor Corps was stationed just outside of Manehattan when a balefire bomb was detonated at the very heart of the city. Many perished in the initial apocalypse, and many more died in the hell that came afterwards, but those few soldiers that lived were galvanized by the experience, determined to survive this trial, and to continue bearing the torch of Equestria.\n\nBut before that, they had to live. Soldiers stood in shock as the realization of what had just occurred hit them. That the world they knew was dead. That they were not. For a time, they did nothing, silence filling their bunker as the morbid realization came to them all. Their world was ending before their very eyes, and they did nothing. That is, until the voice of a stallion, Sergeant Fruit Salad, began to yell. Their bunker wasn't safe this close to a balefire blast, he told them; they had to leave now. A column of power armored ponies marched down the blasted remains of the Manehattan area, their future unknown to them. Along the way, they stopped briefly to gather themselves, where they found..."

  MSR.2.title:0 "The Triumphant Return"
  MSR.2.desc:0 "It took many years for the 21st Powered Armor Corps, now a founding contingent of the order of Steel Rangers, to return to Manehattan. For decades after the end of the world, the city was deemed to radioactive and too dangerous to return to, but eventually, the lure of what was left behind was too great for the early Rangers.\n\nMany ponies hailed the amazing sight of these walking tanks reclaiming Manehattan, block by block. The early Rangers stood in stark contrast to the dogma of today's Rangers, acting as protectors of the innocent, providing aid to those who needed it, all while retaining an armed and armored presence. Of course, anyone looking to hold any sort of power in the wasteland needed the might of industry to back it up. Manehattan may not have been as industrialized as it's rival, Fillydelphia, but it was certainly not something to scoff at. Thankfully for the newly christened Manehattan Contingent, many of these factories still stood tall, giving them a wide range to choose from..."

  MSR.3.desc:0 ""We are now, as we always have been, the strongest group of ponies in the Wasteland. The warlord who's taken over Fillydelphia might believe he is strongest, or the Goddess so distant, but they are not. We are." Elder Cottage Cheese ends his speech with a rough cough into his hoof, his whole body shuddering from the force of the cough. A gathered council, filled with representatives from every corner of the Contingent, sits in front of him, here to reaffirm their aim. Cottage Cheese clears his throat, and continues for a second, 'Under my guidance, we have made great strides. Continue as we are, and we will become the unmatched power of Manehattan, as we were long before.'\n\n Star Paladin Steelhooves is the first to voice dissent, backed by many young reformists, 'The Steel Rangers are not strong, and we haven't been for a long time. When we first returned to Manehattan, we were saviors to the local ponies. Our armor, our weapons, our scribes, they did not just serve our own purposes, but the purposes of all ponies. Under your leadership, Elder, we have continued a decline that's been happening for centuries. South of us, the Fillydelphian Rangers sit by and watch as normal ponies make a stand against tyranny. They do nothing, despite knowing they will be next for Red Eye to destroy. We should not make the same mistake. I am not content with withdrawing into our bunkers, wasting away until we are nothing but ash, while ponies, much braver than us, live and die every day outside. The greatness of the Rangers should return, under our original vision.'\n\nHe is met by much applause, until a feminine voice clears its throat, drawing the stamping of hooves to a close.\n\nTrotting into the room, River Autumn takes her place at the head of the scribes, 'Gentleponies, so afraid to have an intellectual debate that you forgot to invite the actual intellectual? Elder Cottage Cheese, Star Paladin, the answer to this debate is, truly, a simple one. We are nowhere near great, we are weak piddling fools too afraid of the outside world to raise a single hoof to it. Elder, you would see us continue as we are, wasting away in our bunkers working on secret projects, until inbreeding takes us, like we are Stable ponies. Star Paladin, you believe that we will find our greatness by holding hooves, dancing in a circle, and through the mystical idea you call 'Harmony'. If you wish to see the results of Harmony, gentlecolts, I invite you to open a window and smell the ashes. What we need is to forget what has tied us down, forget the ideals of the past. We will not recreate Equestria with nice words and vagaries, nor with secret projects and computers, but with force of arms. Perhaps you two might be foalish enough to not see it, but I know those around are listening.'"

  MSR.4.title:0 "Hearts of Steel"
  MSR.4.desc:0 "When we marched back into Manehattan, what we saw was surprising, and saddening. This once great city, a center of the world itself, filled with ponies who couldn't read beyond a hoof-full. Raiders, tribes, scattered settlements who barely knew how guns worked, let alone how to improve what they had. They saw even our most outdated armor and outdated weapon as divine, to those early ponies, we were not normal ponies, but divine crusaders upon the wasteland, gifted the weapons of gods.\n\n While those in Manehattan have slowly learned more on how to build their own weapons, and have become better educated, we still are head and haunch above them all in technological research. Our power armor might not be seen as divine anymore, but it is feared all the same. Our weapons might not be seen as the arms of gods and goddesses, but they will still cause all to take cover as their roar is heard. On top of that, something very few others can match, let alone in Manehattan, is the ability to work the old factories, and not just work them, but improve them.\n\n As a new dawn rises over the Wasteland, our technological dominance is not guaranteed to continue, as day by day ponies become smarter, more crafty, more organized. Factories left as skeletons for over a century have had life breathed into them once more by the many who surround us. Eventually, these competitors will come after our advanced technology for their own needs, and we must pre-empt them. We may either focus on building up the civilian sector, ensuring each and every citizen will have what they need, or we may build up our military capacity, to keep our unmatched military supremacy."

  MSR.5.title:0 "United We Stand"
  MSR.5.desc:0 "After securing an industrial foundation to supply our Contingent, we quickly became the most powerful faction of all to have ever called this once great city home. Raider warlords, slaver armies, and hordes of hideous abominations have all tested our steel, yet none have been successful, we have outlived all who would seek to crush us. Of course, this has lead to a mythos surrounding our Rangers. Exaggerated legends of our supposed invincibility and our status as saviors of the wastes were once commonplace - an illusion our forefathers were all too happy to maintain, as our hoofhold was still weak and our leadership constantly being challenged. Through these near-propagandistic tales, we were made out to be knights of yore, a unifying force of good that ponies could rely on and our Rangers could be proud to be a part of.\n\nUnifying though the idea might have been, it couldn't have been further from the truth. In reality, our decisions were often pragmatic. Resources are scarce, and were even scarcer back then, and hard decisions had to be made often. Nothing could be more important than our greater goal, to protect ponykind as a whole from the horrors of the old world and more importantly, itself. As time has gone on, the perception of us as great warriors here to protect the Wasteland has largely faded away. Increasingly, our own Rangers have begun to question our goals and our methods.\n\nElder Cottage Cheese has overseen our Contingent for decades through many potential crises. He has long been a rallying figure, a stone in the storm that is our Contingent, providing a voice of reason. In recent times, however, both his pursuits of knowledge and Old World technologies have deepened, while many silently fear that he may have gone so far as abandoning the Chain That Binds. Between these newfound doubts and a growing loss of faith in our traditions and even our current mission, the Contingent has found itself increasingly divided.\n\nNew ideas have quickly risen to prominence, while old ones still retain many followers. Among them, three unifying ideals have dominated all others:\nFirst, many still believe we should trust in the Elder, no matter what.\nNext: Some believe the Elder has overstepped himself, and that we must reinforce and rally around our traditional methods and mission. After all, it is the Chain That Binds which has kept the Rangers stable for so long, and allowed such great safety within our borders.\nA third group, consisting of some of our best scribes, wish to break open the Old World, thinking that, by understanding the technology of yesteryear, we might forge a new path forward.\nWhich goal shall be the unifying call for the Contingent?"
  MSR.5.a:0 "We must stand by the Elder."
  MSR.5.b:0 "If the Elder has broken the Chain, he must be re-bound to it."

  MSR_elections.1.title:0 "An Interesting Find!"
  MSR_elections.1.desc:0 "Scouts have brought back a particularly interesting piece of pre-war equipment. It could only reasonably be described as an advanced terminal, similar to the thousands we've seen before all throughout the wasteland; what makes this one special, however, is its apparent lack of any damage whatsoever. What's more astounding is that the building it was found in was in threatening to completely collapse into the river.\n\nStandard procedure would be to transfer the device to the scribes for immediate research, but the Elder feels that the scribes have gotten too \"uppity\" as of late, and that they should be \"put back in their damn place.\" Withholding this technology from them could easily serve as a threat to them: behave, or your supply will be cut. Conversely, we need not take such drastic measures by breaking tradition as we could simply give the terminal to the scribes, regardless. Hopefully it would be enough to appease them for the time being..."

It is so familiar that those who are perceptive enough can detect who is trotting by, just by the sound of their power armored hooves hitting the floor. Many in Bucklyn would notice him approach first by the tell-tale heaviness of his trot, the strong, weighty thumps accompanying every step being a sound not heard for years. The rumors started instantly, Star Paladin Steelhooves has come, marching a warpath to the Elder's office.\n\n Stood outside the Elder's office are two power armored knights, a tall mare and a shorter stallion, stood stock still, visors glinting in the light. The massive figure trots down the hall, each and every step hitting against the ground, before the voice of Steelhooves speaks, 'I'm here to speak to the Elder.' One of the knights snap a quick salute to him, the mare, 'Star Paladin! You haven't been around since I was an initiate. Knight Mango Slice!' The other knight salutes as well, 'Star Paladin, Knight Mango Dice! Go on through!'\n\n Steelhooves disappears into the office, as the two knights put down their hooves. Slice and Dice look at each other, expressions hidden behind their visors, as Slice speaks, 'Why would he be here?' The two flinch as loud shouting comes from the office, with Dice clearing his throat nervously, 'I think he's not happy about something.' Slice nods along, 'Is he ever?' Dice looks ahead, 'I don't know, not like I can see him smile, since, you know, armor.' Slice shrugs, 'Eh. Gives me something to talk to the other knights about.' More loud shouting comes from the office, able to heard by half of the Contingent with how low it is, the two knights returning to staring straight ahead."

  MSR.6.title:0 "A Vote of No Confidence"
  MSR.6.desc:0 "Tension in the Contingent is nearly visible with how much is around. Reformers, old traditionalists, and even some scribes often get into arguments in the process of performing their basic tasks. The cause of all this tension lies in an ancient portion of the Steel Ranger Code. Deep within, where only the nerdiest dwell, would lay a simple provision for a vote of no confidence. Created to ensure an Elder remains competent, it has not been called upon yet in Steel Ranger history. Yet with the open fights between the conflicting ideologies of the Contingent, it was necessary.\n\n The clause of the Code was found only a week ago, and presented to the Elder by the head of the scribes, River Autumn, who told him about the clause loudly whilst he was overlooking the training of new initiates. The reformers under Steelhooves took what they could get, and soon enough they demanded Cottage Cheese to call upon the vote, to test the confidence of the Contingent as a whole.\n\n The day of the vote has arrived, as two knights, Mango Slice and Mango Dice, wait in line to vote, surrounded by initiates and fellow knights, eager to either reaffirm the call for change, or to reaffirm their confidence in the Elder. Slice looks ahead, before she speaks, 'So, who do you think you're going to be voting for? Steelhooves is a legend, practically an Elder in his own right.' Dice snorts slightly, trotting ahead as the line moves ahead, 'We swore an oath to the Elder, Slice. Maybe Steelhooves is cool, maybe the Elder has his issues, but I keep to my oaths.' Slice glances over, 'You swore an oath to the Elder, and the Elder is asking us to be honest. Is he who you want to serve, Dice?' The two trot ahead again, next in line to go, as both consider their votes."

  MSR_elections.3.title:0 "Ashes to Ashes"
  MSR_elections.3.desc:0 "''Fetch the special supplies.' River Autumn gives a hushed order to a nearby follower, who rushes off away. Up on stage, Scribe Long Wind continues giving his three hour speech, not even taking a break for water, while the provisional council of vote counters sits around. Deep down in the darkest depths of the Steel Ranger code rested a provision, that as long as active debate and speeches occurred, no vote counting, nor any action, could be taken during the vote of no confidence. The scribes have been abusing this fillybustering concept for days, rotating speech givers in and out, boring the provisional council to tears.\n\n With a single motion of her hoof, Scribe Long Wind takes a bow and goes off to sit, quickly replaced by River Autumn herself. Many of the council sleep, some try their hardest to stay awake, with nary a hooffull left in the room by the time she takes the stage, 'Gathered provisional council, I commend your stubbornness, your love of the Code, even mules would struggle to match it. You have all been held here by the oaths you took,  but do not worry, for soon your oaths will matter no longer. We Steel Rangers are rotten, down to our very core, poisoned at the very foundation upon which we are built. Cottage Cheese would spread this poison, Steelhooves would deny it exists, they are both foals. There is only one way to truly deal with such blight. To burn it, until naught but ash remains.'\n\n The doors into the room slam open as scribes, initiates, and a few knights trot in, armed with laser pistols, rifles, snuck away and hidden in stashes long ago. Many in the council jump to their hooves, but quickly sit back down with the motion of a laser rifle, 'Brothers of the Steel Rangers, we have held ourselves down too long. The Chain that Binds, the Oaths, those too feckless to change, they have kept us as scared slaves. No longer.'\n\nWith a single tap, rifles are raised, pistols lifted, as the provisional council is reduced to naught but ash."

  MSR_elections.4.desc:0 "''I read something in a book once, a piece of propaganda, I'm sure, from ancient times. Back when Celestia first became Princess of Equestria, with Luna by her side.' River Autumn stands in the Elder's office, Cottage Cheese say behind his desk with two laser rifles, carried by loyal scribes, aimed right at him, 'It told a story of the first time that the Yaks visited the Equestrian state. She treated them to the nicest rooms, the nicest foods, the best wine, and had servants serve their every want and desire. Until one of the servants made a mistake. The Yaks, angry, smashed him until he was nothing but a smear on the ground. Celestia, of course, was enraged when she found out, so she summoned all the Yaks to a meeting room. As soon as they all arrived, she used a small teleport spell, summing just a gram of plasma from the sun into the room. The Yaks all turned to ash immediately, too fast to even feel pain. Celestia then gathered their ashes, and sent them in urns to the Khan, telling him, clearly, to not mess with her.'\n\n Autumn paces side to side as she speaks, 'In the ancient tribes of Hindia, they had a special form of agriculture, which they called slash and burn. The land was rainforest and jungle, not the best for growing food, of course. So the native deer would travel around, cutting down trees, stacking them, and burning them. Their ashes would mix with the soil and make the soil fertile enough to support massive tribes, compared to elsewhere in the world. A bestiary I found once spoke on Phoenix, who, in their old age, would turn to ash, only to be reborn from them.' She takes a second, looking over at the Elder, 'The point I'm making, Cottage Cheese, is that ash is useful.'\n\nThe Elder coughs into his hoof, leaning back in his seat with tired eyes, 'I've listened to enough of your monologues over the past few days, you foal. If you mean to kill me, then kill me, and spare me the ten page dissertation.' River pauses, and tilts her head, 'Well, if you insist. Oh, one last thing, before you go, Elder. That secret project of yours, tell me about it. Scholarly interest.' The Elder meets her gaze with locked lips. After a second, she blinks, 'Shame.' The cry of two lasers sound out, and in an instant, Cottage Cheese is turned to ash."

The Contingent has affirmed its loyalty and commitment, and confidence in, the Elder, Cottage Cheese.' The stallion places the ballot down, taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes, 'My congratulations, Elder.'\n\n Cottage Cheese, sat within the same room as the votes are counted,  smiles a bit smugly, nodding, 'Thank you, Sir Pine Air Freshener, head of the Provisional Council. This result should come as a surprise to nobody.'

He nods softly, "Yes, the vote is over, they don't serve a purpose anymore. I was just drafting the papers for Sir Pine Air Freshener to dismiss them." With yet another curt nod, Crossroads speaks, "Of course, Elder, as Elder, it is your decision to make if we should return to normal. But as your Star Paladin, I request that you listen to me." He nods again, ‘"I am listening, speak freely."\n\n Crossroads takes a second, before speaking, "Elder, the Provisional Council has helped a lot of the reformers of the Contingent think of you better.

To try and steer our Contingent in a better direction. But the vote showed that the Contingent wants you over me, that they approve of you, even if I don't. You know that the common Ranger looks up to me, Cottage Cheese. And you know that I am the best fighter and officer you have in the Contingent. I will lead the Rangers into whatever battles. I will see us have victory, and I will ensure that you keep them happy."\n\n Autumn scoffs slightly, and smirks, "Blockheads are a bit a dozen in the Contingent, Elder, but brilliant minds are hard to come by. Imagine what would happen if you exiled me. Any of your enemies could happen upon valuable Steel Ranger science. Perhaps Red Eye will somehow figure out how to build power armor, perhaps Gawd will find some energy weapons, perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. So many questions that you don’t want the answers to. But we both know, Elder, that it is science, and intelligence, which leads the Contingent forward, our technological hoof-up on the others, and with my brilliance, we will keep that. Besides, if you ever should, say, need help on a secret project, who knows, I might be able to find out a thing or two."

They had found a selection of logs and data and had pulled them from the terminals in the Stable-Tec HQ.\n\nCottage was about to call it a night when he spotted it: \"§d03.22.1033 - APB to SCT§!\". To most, it would look like nothing more than a simple email between employees, but Cottage Cheese instantly recognized the two ponies involved, Apple Bloom and Scootaloo, two of the three founders behind Stable-Tec! If past experiences were anything to go on, when those two spoke, they always provided clues into the location of new tech.\n\n\"§dHeya Scoots,\nI know you're probably busy with figuring out where we'll be putting our Severyana Stables, but I'm just keeping you up to date with Project Crusader, like you asked me to. My team and I have got all the hardware figured out, and I've got a rough weight estimate for you. It's a little over 300 tons, so most of it will have to be transported by rail or a fleet of pegasi when we get to installing it. Rainbow's got me working on an extra system. She wants something that'll let us hook a regular pony up to it, on account of her \"not wanting a freaky robot running the weather.\" I think I'm gonna reach out to Pinkie and see if I can rope some of her memory mages into this. If all goes well, we should be able to upload a pony's mind to it and have them run it instead of the computer.\n\n- Apple Bloom\n\nP.S. Twilight reached out to me and she wants one of these things now. I guess RD told her about it.§!\"\n\nCottage Cheese sat with his eyes wide. He could barely believe it! A computer that could upload a pony into it? It sounded impossible to him, yet somehow he knew it was real, and it was out there, just waiting for him to claim it..."

The Crusader Maneframe, a computer system which has the same intelligence as a pony, all it needs is the right mind uploaded into it, and the right soul. It was a chance discovery that Cottage Cheese came across it, stumbling across mention of the machine in a terminal message in a broken down Ministry building, back when he was a young knight. Being so young, of course he never explored it as deep as he should have, but now the years are many, and the path of his life has been well-tread.\n\n A cough wracks his body, causing the elderly Elder to cover his mouth, his whole body shuddering with the force of the cough, slowly pulling his hoof away, mouth tasting like blood. The papers in front of him are equations and code, the secret to unlocking the uploading process that will allow him to become one with the Crusader Maneframe. It's taken years of hard study and calculation to come even this far, and yet it still doesn't work, something doesn't make sense, and judging by the worsening coughs, well, he might not have much time left to finish it.\n\n However, there is an idea that creeps across his mind. The scribes, though they might sometimes be uppity, and demand more than they deserve, it is undeniable that they are intelligent. Many of them are savants in mathematics, science, and technology. If he were to share this to them, it might cause a bit of debate amongst them, but it'll mean he can figure it out easier."

Of course, though, just his luck, that none of them give a precise location, though given the valuable technology being spoken of, it does make sense that specific location wouldn't be given. After all, technology powerful enough to extend one's life eternally is technology that would be damaging, should it get into the wrong hooves, hooves other than the illustrious and ancient Elder.\n\n A cough wracks his form, harsh and wet, making his mouth taste like blood as he recovers. Scavenging teams haven't been told what to look for in specific, of course, the more ponies who were suspicious, the more it would cost him to dissuade them from stopping him. It would be horrible, after all, should some talkative Knight tell some intrepid 'hero' to come and stop him on the precipice of his ascension, though of course, that would never happen. Yet scavenging stealthily is slow, and nothing has been found, with his time steadily ticking away. Of course, he could order more scavenging, but that would draw suspicion from others, yet if he doesn't devote more resources, who's to say he'll live to see eternity?"

After a couple hours of tense silence the group of Steel Rangers finally reached the marked sewer grate. After traversing the dank tunnels, they arrived in front of a large cog shaped door with the number 29 painted on it. The door slowly slid open while the Rangers watched in anticipation for any possible danger. They were only greeted with unnerving silence. At the dark opening, they hesitated and chattered who should go first. Finally, lead Paladin scoffed at them before trotting in. Creepin their way through the decayed hallways, they checked their EFS for any potential threats. However, there was no sign of activity, only the same unnerving silence. The point pony continued to follow the schematics that she had downloaded into her helmet and quietly guided the team to their destination. Eventually, the Ranger team arrived outside a small, sealed hatch. With a bit of grit and some help from their power armor, they were able to breach the hatch. Cottage Cheese began to smile as the Rangers entered the hidden room. "Elder, is this what you were looking for?" the lead Paladin asked.

The math, the planning, all the research Cottage Cheese has done, none of them work, there's something there, some variable that he's missing.\n\n Standing in front of the mainframe, the Elder trots closer, and rests a hoof upon its metal exterior, feeling the hum of internal mechanics travel through his bones, "The key to eternal life, right in front of me. But this is no fountain of youth where you drink from it, nor is it magic, which simply happens. I am data." He coughs roughly, resting his head against the machine, "I am data in old hardware. Software in a crumbling casing. Why is it so hard to upload myself? Am I not the same as the data you read? Did no pony before me research this, know how to do this? The secret to eternal life in front of them and they didn't solve it. No, they left it for me to solve, and by now, it might be too late. My body decays day by day, my eyes grow unfocused, my mind grows weaker. I sleep longer and longer, and soon, there will be the day where I never wake up at all. I am the timer for this contingent's collapse, they wouldn't survive without me, yet I can't stop that timer, unless you tell me how to do this."\n\n Cottage Cheese steps back, looking at the machine, "I am here, Mainframe! I found all the secrets, I found all the clues, I found you! But I am out of time, I can't solve another mystery for you! Just tell me, please, tell me what I need to do!" He shouts to the computer, ending off with a rough coughing fit, making him collapse onto the floor, his vision going foggy.\n\nAs he recovers, though, his eyes rest upon something nearby, a cable. He croaks out, "I am data, I can't upload myself. Because. Because I cannot connect." He looks up at the computer again, "I understand now, I need a connection, a 'cable'.

You receive soul as well, and soul cannot be so easily uploaded. At least, not without some 'translation'." He begins to pace side to side, "I discovered it when a scout came back from a Ministry of Image building, apparently they had the key to my ascension. The Black Book. Zebra Necromancy, an unholy, abominable magic written by those who destroyed this land, able to transfer my soul into you."\n\n He coughs, but the fit is short, before he stands straighter, "It's ironic that I need to rely on Zebra magic in order to merge with you. In order to save the Wasteland, to preserve the idea of Equestria itself. If the stripes who wrote that book knew it would result in this, would they have ever put pen to parchment? Well. I'll have to ask them when Equestria is re-unified, of course. In a few centuries, perhaps, when Rangers land in Colthage, I will see what they have to say upon seeing me."\n\n Yet another cough rises its way up his throat, but he chokes it down, shaking his head, "No more weakness, Mainframe. No more failing body. Only one step remains, to find the book, in the ruins of Canterlot, and to bring it back to me.

However, I chose you all because you are the most competent of the Contingent, you all are loyal, cunning, strong, and brave, the best traits of any Ranger."\n\n Cottage Cheese takes a second to cough, causing a small wince in both Slice and Dice, before he recovers, "You will be heading to Canterlot in search of a highly dangerous artifact called The Black Book. It is a dark piece of Zebrican magic, writing of necromancy, and dark witchcraft. Of course, as you all know, the zebras of Glyphmark live right nearby to Canterlot, should any of those stripes find the Book, they could wreak havoc across the Wasteland. For the safety, and protection of all ponies, I ask you now, go. Go to Canterlot, and secure the book, only then will the Wasteland be safe from its threat."\n\n With sharp salutes, the Rangers begin the March west, as Slice speaks to Dice, trotting past their fellow Rangers, "So, Canterlot, think we're going to die?" Dice turns to face Slice, "I'm going to try not to think about it." Slice turns to look forward, and then looks back at him, "Say, you know what I'm hoping to see? A ruby. I've read about them in books, and they're described as being so red, and, you know, I wonder how red they actually are?" Dice nods after a second, "I want to see an emerald.

After a second, he rests his forehead against it as well, feeling the machine whirr through his skull, "This is the stuff of fiction.

Only. . ."\n\n Cottage Cheese trails off, as he feels a cough come to this throat. He pulls away from the machine as he begins to cough, a hoof by his mouth. But the coughing is too much, and his hoof returns to the ground, trying desperately to support his body, as coughing spasms shake his entire body. From his throat comes blood, splattering against the side of the Mainframe, followed shortly by his head slamming against it, trying to center himself. But it's a failing attempt, as his head slowly slides down the machine, and his hooves collapse under him.

So many lives lost, but in the end, it will be worth it. He speaks after a moment, "They will be honored as the bravest and the best. Knight Whiskey Chaser was one of our best, and her name will forever be held in honor and respect, Paladin Shortcake. I do not blame you for pulling back when you did, better to save lives than all die, and let the book fall into the wrong hooves." He takes a second, and chokes down a cough, "We don't have long, Paladin, the time approaches where it might be too late. Gather fresh recruits and as many supplies as you need. Hopefully, now with experience, you will retrieve the book. Get your armor repaired, as soon as it is, I expect you to go out gain. Good luck, Paladin."\n\n Shortcake snaps a salute, "Yes, Elder. We will get the book before it is too late, I just hope we don't fail again. That city is dangerous, it almost feels like a random number generator is deciding if we succeed or if we fail."

Technically true, and in line with their mission, meaning there's been no suspicion.\n\n Of course, an issue arises with actually taking Stable 29, due to the Stable being owned by the Manehattan Raiders. Their leader, Bonecrusher, is notorious for their offensive ability, and their name is quite literal, earned when they crushed the bones of a lone Steel Ranger Knight. Letting them exist just south of Bucklyn, with a claim to fame of being a killer of Rangers was already unpopular, so no Ranger is going to complain about marching down there and kicking flank.

Not during the war, and not any time after, he might be a pony with opinions, sure, but not a leader. He didn't mean to replace Cottage Cheese, never wanted to be in charge in Manehattan, but that vote of no confidence forced his hoof, made him take up the title of Elder. Crossroads, on the other hoof, is an intelligent, clever, strong, and charismatic pony, brave and courageous, a born leader of ponies.\n\n It didn't come as a surprise when Crossroads came into his office and began. Telling him he has a chance now, with his reforms in place, to step down, rather than ruling as Elder any longer. Even now, she talks to him, "You are a great leader, Elder, you and I both know this, but your reforms have destabilized the Contingent. You've kicked out many of our Rangers, you've opened up to the outside, many respect you, but many more wish to see you gone. If they have their will, then none of your reforms will be kept, and the entire Contingent could collapse. Step down, Elder, while you're still able, and allow me to take your place as Elder, so we can see the Steel Rangers become a mighty force in the world."\n\n With a sigh, Steelhooves trots slowly to a nearby window, looking out of it into Bucklyn Cross, seeing born Rangers mingling with outsider Rangers, "I don't know if you will keep all of this. If you will keep us moving in a good direction, Crossroads. I don't know if your way will be any more stable, but you make a good point. Many don't like what I've done. And given enough time, they might try and overthrow me, and turn back all that's been done." He takes a minute, "What would she want? This place is my responsibility now. But should I do a job that's not true to myself?" He takes in a deep breath, and a deep breath out."

Steelhooves, no, Applesnack stands off to the side, watching his beloved Applejack dealing with all the bureaucracy of running a Ministry. Right now, she would be listening to a diatribe from a representative from Horsepower Electronics, a business-type who thinks he's more important than he is. Yet no matter how much he condescends or speaks down to the Ministry Mare, she remains calm, until the negotiations end.\n\n Watching the company representative leave, Applesnack grins slightly, "I don't rightly know how you put up with those type, Applejack." Applejack sighs from the table, and then stands, stretching her forelegs as she does, "'Cuz I'm stubborn as a mule, sugarcube, besides, ain't anything new. When ma and pa passed, and Granny got old, weren't nobody else who was gonna talk to Filthy Rich to sell apples." Applesnack chuckles softly, "I think you enjoy this less than selling apples." She snorts softly, and trots over to him, "Eyyup, but it's more important. Don't matter how I feel, what matters is getting weapons into the hooves of those who need 'em, like you, sugarcube. When they try and push me down, I just push right back, show 'em I'm stronger."\n\n The two begin to trot together, exiting the Hub, as Applesnack smiles towards her, "I don't know where you get that strength from. Sometimes it feels like all these business types just want to argue and argue, like they care about nothing but the money." Applejack looks over at him, and smiles softly, "That's because they do, and that's why I always beat 'em in the end, sugarcube. Now I ain't rightly the Element of Kindness, and I ain't Generosity either, but I'm honest to who I am. And who I am is somepony who helps other ponies. Ain't nothing that'll inspire a pony more than knowing somepony else out there is relying on them, sugarcube, you remember that next time you're under fire."\n\n Applesnack opens his mouth to respond, but it's too late. The dream fades away, his beloved Applejack becoming nothing but dust, the sun covered by grey clouds once more as Steelhooves wakes back up in his room. Yet though the dream is gone, his mind can't help but to linger on the memory."

Yet when it comes down to it, overthinking would only make it worse. Being abrupt and honest is the only way to approach this, as he did with most issues.\n\nJust as he finished recounting his words, he could hear the door turn open to reveal Star Paladin Crossroads, one of the few Rangers he could not guarantee his loyalty from. At least not yet.\n\nCrossroads, for a very brief moment, had a look of confusion on her face, but it was quickly swapped with what was obviously a forced expression of resentment. She stomped into the room, and without giving any moment of respite, questioned her Elder. \n\n"So, are you here to send me off?"\n\nHe could see that her face was sour with intent, with no hint of subtlety behind her question, yet Steelhooves could also see that this was still a forced facade, one perhaps hiding the worry within.\n\n"No, Star Paladin. You know that isn't why I called you here."\n\nHer expression softened, yet the bitterness behind her face clearly remained.\n\n"Then what do you want?"\n\nUnlike her immediate questioning, Steelhooves let the air stir for a few seconds before continuing.\n\n"My proposed plans are something that you have shown clear resentment towards, and as I understand that, I want to change that. Change for someone as loyal to our previous mission can be difficult. But I want to make clear-"\n\n"I'm not cooperating with you."\n\n"Crossroads...""

The Star Paladin now had a grimaced look on her face, perhaps at his audacity to call the mare simply by her name without her proud title in the contingent. Yet, for once, she followed her new Elder's example of letting her thoughts sit for a moment, at least before Steelhooves continued.\n\n"I know that the path I will try to lead us towards may not be the best in terms of respecting our contingent... but you need to know that in order to get anything done, in order for me to start making real progress, I need cooperation among our ranks. More importantly, I need your cooperation."\n\nCrossroads continued to avoid eye contact, although her expression seemed to soften as Steelhooves could see her start to take his words to heart.\n\n"I... understand that cooperating with someone you disagree with is a tough thing to do," he continued, "and I respect that. I know that you honor our ideals and code above all else, and that's what makes me admire you as a fellow Ranger. But you know that I don't mean harm to any pony, especially to those who you may think deserve it. Outdated and unnecessarily rigid our current ideals may be... I only desire the best for us, and in order to do that, I need to continue with my reforms and to do the absolute best I can to change our Rangers to what we once were. But for now, I..."\n\nThe Elder paused and gently stepped forward, delicately longing for her attention.\n\n"Please, Crossroads. I just want to make sure I have your support, that's all."\n\nAfter a moment of silence to consolidate her thoughts, the Star Paladin's eyes finally focused once more on the Elder in front of her."

  MSR_steelhooves.18.title:0 "Oath of the Rangers"
  MSR_steelhooves.18.desc:0 "Applesnack marches in his power armor as the sun shines down upon him, and a column of other ponies wearing the same. The ponies of Canterlot crowd on the roads, watching the legion of the newly named Steel Rangers as they march down the streets. Metallic hooves crash down as one against the stone streets, silvery armor gleaming in the sunlight, the cheers of ponies coming from all around as they behold the next step in Equestrian warfare. With this, they are promised, the stripes won't stand a chance, with this, so say the propaganda, we'll kick the stripes back to the Stone Age.\n\n Their marching comes to a stop all at once, as the armored column reaches Canterlot Palace, the Rangers spreading out into a wide line. Journalists click their cameras, the Ministry Mares, including the ever-lovely Applejack, stand on a balcony above to watch, and from the palace trot the two sisters. Celestia and Luna, their Alicorn forms towering even over the trotting tanks, their eyes looking over each and every one of them. Luna's eyes brimming with excitement to see the new tools of war, while Celestia's hide a look of horror and disdain.\n\n Luna speaks, her voice quieting the cheers of ponies, carrying its way across the courtyard, to each and every Steel Ranger, "Steel Rangers! Protectors of Equestria! Present weapons!" With a single synchronized movement, every Ranger pulls out a ceremonial blade, holding it forward. The two princesses trot down the line, their wings batting the blades down, from facing the air, to point towards the ground, while Celestia speaks, "Do you, Steel Rangers of Equestria, swear your oath, to forever protect Equestria, and all of those who reside within it?" The Rangers cry as one, "I do, Princess!" Luna trots in front of them all, and speaks once more, "Do you swear to uphold Harmony in all your actions?" The Rangers shout once more, "I do, Princess!"\n\nCelestia makes to speak, but before she can, the dream ends, and Steelhooves finds himself in his room once more. He finds himself staring at the ceremonial blade with which he swore his oath. Perhaps Equestria is gone. But its ponies aren't, and he swore an oath to protect them. All Steel Rangers exist for, is to protect the ponies of Equestria."

They are surrounded by ponies in leather armor, the milita that Slice trained, but they don't look too worried about anything, trusting the two steel ponies leading them to keep them safe.\n\n As the caravan enters into Bucklyn Cross, many Knights and Initiates watch from the sidelines, whispering amongst themselves. Slice looks towards the whispering ponies, until she hears one unarmored knight, Knight Whiskey Chaser, speak loud enough to be heard, "Outsiders, pff, bunch of uneducated savages." Slice frowns, stopping on the spot and popping open her armor. Dice looks over, "Slice, leave it be." She doesn't listen, though, marching from her armor over to Knight Chaser, looking into her eyes, "You got a problem with them, horn-head?"\n\n Chaser scowls, "Horn-head? Who the fuck do you think you are, coming in here with a bunch of outsiders, huh? Look out everyone, I think the barbarians are going to steal everything that's not bolted down, and take it to their shitty little-" She can't finish her sentence, as Slice growls, and punches Chaser right in the chest. Immediately all the surrounding Knights respond, moving in to try and get between the two, but it's no use, as Chaser summons magic missiles, firing them at Slice.\n\n Dice hops into action, now out of his own armor, kicking Chaser right in the side, knocking off the aim of her missiles, "You want to try and aim at my sister you bitch?!" Another Knight would just as quickly buck Dice right in the side, crumpling him to the ground. The milita of Friendship City watch in horror, until one of them lifts their rifle, pointing it at another stallion who goes in to attack Slice.\n\nThe sound of a gunshot, and a ping against metal, fills the air, as all the fighting goes silent. Stood between the rifle, and the one it was aimed at, is Steelhooves, the bullet having crumpled against his armor, "Are these Steel Rangers? A bunch of bickering foals?" He turns to face Slice, Dice, and Chaser, "You three are brothers, and sisters, you are Steel Rangers. And these new ponies are too. Discard your weapons, and get up!" He shakes his head, as the three slowly get up, "Knight Chaser, you will be given cleaning duty for two moons for using dangerous magic against your fellow Rangers, and for insulting your fellow Rangers. Knight Mango Slice, Knight Mango Dice, you will be given leave in Friendship City for the next three moons. If these ponies are the new Steel Rangers, then teach them to have more trigger discipline.""

  MSR_steelhooves.20.desc:0 "When dreams overtook Steelhooves this time, he didn't wake up in a memory of his past, with his old body, no, instead, he finds himself stood in a void, still clad in thick metal. The void is empty, all except for Applejack, still in her prime, like always in the dreams. She gives him her usual small, charming smile, "That armor don't fit you, sugarcube." Her smile is met with nothing but expressionless metal, eyes gazing at her from behind a soulless visor, "It's the only thing keeping me together." She trots closer, "For how long?" He responds quickly, "Since I killed Zecora."\n\n She pauses in her steps, and simply nods, "Killed your hope. Killed mine, too." He looks at her for a minute, and nods, "Yes." She looks away, "Is that why you're changing, sugarcube?" He shakes hies head, "No, it's not. I'm a soldier. Killing is what I do. I'm not made to be a leader. I'm not a leader. But you were, and you always were. You led me into the best times of my life. And I followed you. I followed you through Tartarus. Through mud, and blood, and rain. I still follow you. Do you remember that night by the cliff?"\n\n She nods softly, "You asked about having foals, after the war ended. Why?" He stares ahead, icily, as he speaks, "I've gone back to that cliff before. I thought. Thought how heavy my armor would be in the ocean. Wonder if things like me could even die. Or if I could drown forever. But I didn't test it, because I saw someone. I saw a colt from the Manehatten Contingent. Cottage Cheese almost fell off the cliff, but I caught him. Sent him right back on his way, before returning to nothing but death." He takes a second, "I asked you about foals, and you said maybe. I'm realizing. You died, but in the end, we did have a foal. The Steel Rangers. We made them, and I've been there, watching, as they grew, and changed."\n\nHe turns away from her, and looks off into the distance, "But I wasn't there for them, like I should have been. Now. Now I am. You aren't here, though, but you are, in their smiles. Their laughter. Their friendships. In me, and my heart. I'm no leader. But I'm stubborn, as stubborn as an armored train. And I remember you, the best mare I've ever known. And I know. I know I have a responsibility to our creation, to see it through to the end." Applejack trots closer once more, "You know this is gonna be the last time you see me, sugarcube?" He looks back, his helmet showing an emotion, stoic acceptance, "No it isn't. Every time I blink, I see you, Applejack. And you remind me that I'm more than this armor. I'm going to make things better, because that's what you would do.""

Cottage Cheese, for all his faults, kept things stable, but Steelhooves pushed them all over, and now here she is, picking up all the pieces. First on her list to deal with was Proctor Bloom, the working head of the Scribes since River Autumn was banished. Apparently Steelhooves had been giving her an entire list of privileges to help along research and scribe loyalty. Crossroads, of course, promised to keep those privileges, after all, as seen by his crafty River Autumn was, one must never underestimate a scribe.\n\n Next up were the Paladins, who, despite being generally seen as a more conservative part of the Steel Rangers, had a few among their ranks who were genuine believers in Steelhooves' philosophy. Chief among them was Paladin Shortcake, a loud mare who shouted over Crossroads whenever she tried to convince the Paladins. However, a few outliers will be fine, as many of the Paladins wished for a return to the days of Cottage Cheese, and happily agreed.\n\n The Knights were the most difficult of the branches to convince, and, truly, she never managed to convince them all. It was the power of the Knights that allowed Steelhooves to take power, and it is them who have begun to resist Crossroads. Of course, many were satisfied that he gave power over willingly to her, but many others are still angry. They say she's betrayed oaths and promises, and nothing she says will convince them.

Dice sighs softly, "Well, I enjoyed the little vacation, but I'm not surprised. Come on, let's get packed and get going."\n\n Slice looks at the message for a minute, and then shakes her head, "No, I'm not going to go." Dice looks over at her, "This is a direct order from the Elder, Slice, you can't just say no." Slice frowns, "She's not my Elder. I voted for Steelhooves, and I know you did too. I don't know-I don't know what she did to him, or what blackmail she used to force him to step down, but she's not our Elder! He is! I'm not going to serve some pretender like her!"\n\n Dice frowns, and looks away, "Slice, look, I know you like Steelhooves, and what he was doing. I do too. But we're being called to go back home. We're just Knights, we aren't going to do anything by saying no to her order, except being kicked out." Slice looks over at him, and shakes her head, "No, I'm not doing it. These are ponies, Dice, just like us, and just like every other Ranger, and my Elder sent me here to help them. I'm not going to abandon them just because some pretending bitch decided to call us back. I'm going to stay."\n\n With a small sigh, Dice looks back at his sister, "Slice, its home, but I don't disagree. I don't like it either, but I don't agree with you." He takes a second, and nods softly, "I'll tell her you got sick with some radiation. Give you an excuse to stay back here longer, and give you some time to think this through. But I'm begging you to please think it through fully. I hope you think and realize she's your Elder, no matter how she got in, and I hope you can teach all the ponies here before you leave."

Its purpose, much like many of our other ancient ideals, was washed away under the balefire that swept across Equestria.\n\nUnfortunately, there are others like Steelhooves that wish to change our trajectory and return to our original vision, and even if they bring up good points that can reflect their good intentions, in the long run they are sadly still mistaken. The present no longer calls for such ideals. The countless enemies that still plague the wastes have evolved in such foul ways, it renders our original purpose obsolete. I must remind them that the Equestria of old is forever gone, and that the balefire bombs that ravaged the landscape long ago also wiped out the last shred of 'innocence' we once swore to protect. Our original mission may have changed, but our purpose to serve the greater good still remains.\n\nWe need to remember our new purpose, and remember the mission we have sworn to complete.

Indeed, I have been chosen as the new Elder, and to correct the mistakes of our previous Elder, gladly welcome you back. Our individuality is what makes our contingent so incredibly unique, more so than any other organization in the Wasteland, and it is precisely why each and every single one of you added so much to our organization. It pained me to see such skilled Rangers leave the place they called home for so long. I myself have never seen you as the outcasts or outliers Steelhoves has portrayed you as, but only as my fellow Rangers, and that will forever be the case.\n\nI ask that you return to the place you have sworn to serve, as only with you can we start to make our contingent better than it ever was and continue to succeed in our mission.\n\nSincerely, Elder Crossroads"

Our original ideals are long gone, and just like the rest of the Wasteland, our organization has only evolved to better survive in this new, unforgiving landscape. The power of emotion within a pony is something he puts far too much trust in, and while I can see the strength in honesty, carrying this sort of attitude won't get you far in actually slaying the monsters that terrorize Bucklyn and the enemies that seek to erase our group from existence. I have always believed that it was our steel and power armor that made us properly feared, and this shall remain the case.\n\nWhile it is important to hold strong emotional qualities that help make each Steel Ranger as mentally strong as they may be physically, emotions don't win you wars. And as surprising as it may seem to Steelhooves, Our Ministry Mare knew this as well.\n\nIt wasn't Applejack's honesty that made the Rangers what they were back then. Nor was it our compassion for one another that made the Rangers so widely known throughout the wasteland either. It was always steel, steel and guns. We must never forget this, lest we forget the very own technology that brought us here."

The two ensure that no traitors come by, but in the quiet halls, Slice speaks, 'Are you sure about this, Dice? This new Elder, I've heard rumors about her. They say she killed Cottage Cheese, and the provisional council. They say she's the real traitor.' Dice takes a moment, looking down the halls, before looking at her, 'She's the Elder, and we swore oaths to follow the Elder, Slice. Rumors are just rumors, Cottage Cheese was old, and sick, and the provisional council wasn't anypony important. She's no murderer, but even if she was, she's our Elder.'\n\n From down the hall would come hoofsteps, the two of them turning to look as a group of scribes, carrying stashed weapons, round the corner. Dice sighs, relaxing, before turning to keep a lookout, as the scribes march to a center stockpile, 'Through thick and thin, we are here for each other, Slice.' Slice nods after a second, 'Steelhooves is still out there.' Dice turns his head to her, 'He caused this to begin with. If he never came back, then none of this would be happening. We serve the Elder. Now back to lookout, Slice, we don't want our friends inside to be caught.' As soon as he finishes speaking, a series of three knocks sounds on the door, as a group of scribes and knights come out carrying the stashed weapons, rushing off with them to a central stockpile."

Their hoof steps are quieted, their voices hushed, as the loyalists muster to eliminate the supply lines of those who would resist the new Elder. Two knights stand out of a supply depot where traitors have been gathering supplies, Slice and Dice, with Slice gripping her weapon close, 'These are our brothers and sisters, Dice. Are we really going to kill them?' Dice looks ahead, at the door, 'They're traitors, they stopped being Rangers the minute they disobeyed the Elder.'\n\n Up in the sky, red lights illuminate the city, flares arcing through the sky, a signal to begin the attack against the traitors. All across the city, doors are kicked open as loyalist forces swarm traitor holdouts, lasers and guns filling the air with their noises. Slice takes a second to breathe in, and then slowly breathe out, 'We don't have to do this. Say we kicked open the wrong building. Or we got knocked out.' Dice steps in front of the door, power armor whirring as he does, 'I am doing this. Are you going to follow me, Sister?' With a second of hesitation, she nods, and flicks the safety on her weapon off.\n\n In but a second, the doors to the hideout are kicked down, as metallic hooves stomp on the ground, and Dice shouts, 'Weapons down, surrender, traitors!' When the dust clears, they wouldn't see a room full of traitors. Instead, they see just one, a young initiate holding up a fire bomb, 'For the Rangers.' With that, the initiate would set off the fire bomb, destroying the entire room, and everything within it. Slice pulls Dice back, the two taking cover as the bomb goes off, fire rushing harmlessly past their armored frames."

Some would be in the midst of flipping through books, reading to pass the time, oblivious to the worried and uneasy tension in the air. The tension is cut by a door opening, the soft tap of hooves tapping the floor as River Autumn takes the stage in front of them. Her eyes scan the crowd, her face adopting a small grin, 'Good evening, my fellow scribes and learned ponies, I am sure you all have heard the good news, that I have become Elder of the Manehattan Contingent. Many of you have helped me here, and for that, I thank you. For the rest, I wish to tell you the situation.'\n\n She clears her throat softly, before continuing, 'As your Elder, science and strength will rule side by side, working to a common goal, to restore Equestria. Within fifteen years of my ascendance to Elder, I expect to gain a massive population of ponies, who will be rapidly educated, many of whom will join all of you in research. They will become part of us, and we will become part of them, after hard years of conquest and fighting. All of you will be instrumental in discovering research to allow this conquest to happen.'\n\n With yet another pause, River would continue, 'But not all of you wish to see this future come to pass. Many of you are, so to say, cowards, who would rather run away, than dare to stand for anything that matters. So I make you an offer. You may stay, and forever follow me, or you may leave, and be released from your oaths.' It only takes a few seconds, before two scribes get up, trotting out of the room. Two guards in the room would nod, and exit after them. A third scribe gets up, but a friend pulls them back down, with no other daring to make a move, 'Perfect. Welcome, my scribes, to a new, stronger, Contingent.'"

  MSR.123.desc:0 "Two knights, loyal to the enemy, not to the Elder, stand guard over the armory, where the stores of weapons for the entire Contingent is, save for the weapons stockpiled by loyalists. A sound ripples down the hall like thunder, the crashing of hundreds of hooves at once, and turning the corner would be a horde of loyalist fighters. Initiates, scribes, and all other manner of ponies fire their weapons wildly, most shots missing, and the remaining shots being absorbed by the guards' armor.\n\n The thunder becomes a constant roar as the two guards respond, miniguns on their sides revving up, as a wave of bodies is met with a wall of bullets. Ponies, young and old, collapse as bullets rip them apart, shot in the bodies or the heads. The worst, though, are those shot in the legs, who collapse, only to be trampled on by the stampede, stomped to death slowly, struggling against their fate. The hailstorm of bullets lasts for minutes, but eventually, even the largest stores of ammunition wouldn't matter, as the miniguns begin to melt under the stress of constant fire. Their barrels are ruined, the firing mechanism breaking from overuse, with nothing now standing between the guards and the oncoming horde.\n\n Leading the front of the charge now, Slice and Dice, power armored hooves stamping on the broken bodies of loyalists below, charge the two guards. Lowering their heads and leading with their shoulders, power armor clashes against power armor as the guards are knocked back against the wall. Both Slice and Dice lift their hooves up, ready to punch right through the helmets of the guards, but they would be stopped by a feminine clear of the throat. River Autumn steps forward, looking down upon the two guards, a small grin on her face, 'The keys, would you kindly?' With no other option, the guards bow their heads and take out the keys to the armory, offering them to the new Elder."

River Autumn trots in, wearing some nicer robes over her body, wordlessly taking a seat at the head of the table. Her gaze is like steel, searching for who shall be the first to break. Her question is answered as a knight leans forward, a younger fellow, 'This is all a disgrace, you are not fit to be an Elder any more than I am! We all know what you've done, 'Elder', killing Cottage Cheese, who was ten times the Elder than you ever will be. You have nothing, you are no true Elder, and so you've come crawling to us to try and get support.' Another knight chimes in, 'You're a scribe, why should you be able to lead knights? What gives you the right?' Other knights, one by one, would jump in with their own words, the whole room becoming a cacophony of noise.\n\n River silences all the knights with a single raised hoof, and a small, serene smile, 'Perhaps you are right, knight, perhaps I have no more right to sit here than you do. Yet I would have you over Cottage Cheese in a heartbeat. The previous Elder was a continuation of our downfall, an old, feeble stallion. I know it seems awfully convenient that I have become Elder in his passing, especially after my impassioned scribes spoke so long during the vote of no confidence, but it is just that. Coincidence. Cottage Cheese came to me because of his sickness, and as I tried my best to treat him, he passed.' She pauses, 'I'm sure you all heard it over the past few months. His coughs. He tried his best to act strong, and he delayed seeking my aid, until it was too late. While I do not agree with what he did to our Contingent, I am still saddened, every moment, that I failed to save him.'\n\nShe stands from her seat, placing her forehooves on the table in front of her, 'You are right, I need support, I need capital that I can use to see my vision fulfilled, because I have a dream. A dream that one day, we will no longer cling to titles like knights or scribes, that one day, every pony will live safely, protected by gallant ponies in powered armor, that nopony will have to starve or live in fear ever again. I come to you right now, knights of Manehattan, to ask you this. Do you wish to see a future of greatness, or will we tear ourselves apart?' After a moment of silence, the knights would stand one by one, before giving her a salute."

River Autumn sits at the head of a table, surrounded by the gathered paladins of the Contingent, her silver tongue playing a tune for their iron ears and steely gazes, 'Elder Cottage Cheese was not your friend, my dear Paladins, he was not a friend of any of us. I know that I am a scribe, I have not carried rifles or fought in battles as you all have, but through it all, I have still fought. I fight through hordes of papers, through those who would turn against our Contingent, those like Cottage Cheese. Fools too blind to see that they're nothing but foals throwing a fit. Elder Cottage Cheese led us down a declining path, he knew he was dying, and he sought to drag all of you down with him. I am here to-'\n\n Yet she would not be able to finish a sentence, as one of the eldest paladins stands from their seat, 'Cottage Cheese was the Contingent, he gave his life, in youth, and in elder years, to the Contingent. He fought for us, all of us, to his last, shaky breath, River. You're nothing but a fox in a henhouse, thinking we're all foolish, thinking we're all idiots, because we don't kowtow and bow to you. We swore an oath to serve our Elder, and even when dead, Cottage Cheese is twice the Elder you ever will be.' With a snort, the elderly Paladin would turn, and begin to trot out of the room, with a flood of Paladins following after. They don't say a word to River, or to the guards as they trot by, like mourners marching to a funeral they would leave, morbid and silent.\n\n When the last Paladin has left, only a few remain at the table with River. River looks very, very angry, gritting her teeth, but her rage is subsided by a Paladin speaking to her, 'Elder Autumn. We here might not agree with everything you do, or everything you say. We might not want you as Elder at all. But we swore oaths. Lead us into greatness once more.'"

The room is filled with Rangers of all types, from scribes and initiates to knights and paladins, who do their best to ignore the shouts of the impassioned knight.\n\n 'Elder Cottage Cheese has been killed, and we all know the only true successors to him are Crossroads and Steelhooves! You all break your paths by serving a false Elder, a false prophet!' The doors open up as two ponies in long coats enter in, a unicorn and an earth pony. They calmly trot up behind the shouting knight while he is looking another way, before the earth pony lunges at the knight. He tackles the knight down to the ground, pinning him against the ground, growling to him, 'Stay down, traitor.'\n\n The knight growls right back, their hooves grabbing a laser pistol and pointing it right at the head of the earth pony on top of them. Before a single laser is fired, though, the unicorn's horn would light up, ammunition being ripped away from the pistol, the energy cell floating in a magical aura. Said aura then surrounds the pistol, spinning it around and striking the knight in the temple with it. The earth pony frowns, while the unicorn trots up beside him, and grins, 'Let's bring them in.

With a sigh, she sits back and rubs at her eyes, checking the time again. Eleven at night, when every Ranger except those on night guard would be asleep. Of course, it wasn't hard at all to make sure all the night guards were loyalists, loyalists equipped with only the best weapons.\n\n With a small smile, she floats over a radio, turning it on, the sultry tones of Sweetie Belle flowing forth from Tenpony radio. Outside, the sounds of war begin. The bangs of guns, the screams and thunder-like rumble of explosions, the sound of pounding hooves as ponies rush to alarms. River sings along to the song on the radio, the sounds of death outside being ignored, 'When I step around, I hear the sound-' The crashes of power armored hooves sound right outside her door, before being cut down, 'Clip-a-clopping up and down the street.' She pauses for a second as all the sounds slowly die down.\n\n With a small smile, she sings a bit more, 'What's this wonderful feeling in my head?' With a flash of magic, the radio shuts off, 'Victory, I think that's what I feel.'

Slice and Dice stand in front of them, the two pairs of power armored ponies staring each other down.\n\n Slice speaks first, breaking the silence, as rain begins to come down around them, 'Star Paladin Crossroads, Star Paladin Steelhooves, you are charged with betraying the Contingent, disobeying direct orders by the Elder, and aiding the enemy of the Rangers. You have been found guilty. But you still die with honor, buried in your power armor, as you deserve. Star Paladin Crossroads, do you have any last words?' Crossroads looks at them both from behind her helmet's visor, her eyes and expression unseen. A minute passes as the rain comes down harder, before she finally speaks, 'Do it.' With a crack of a rifle, Dice puts a bullet right through her visor and into her head, killing her in an instant.\n\n Slice looks on the body, slowly, and unsteadily speaking to the remaining traitor, 'Star Paladin Steelhooves, do you have any last words?' Steelhooves stares forward, like a statue, before his low voice rumbles from within the armor, 'Thank you for letting me see the Elder, Mango Slice. You'll want to use larger bullets.' Slice and Dice look at each other, and Slice bows her head. She unsteadily aims her rifle, equipped with large, armor-piercing rounds, and fires. The bullet punctures right through Steelhooves' helmet and head, but he remains standing. She fires again, and again, and again, emptying her magazine into his head, and only with the last bullet would he finally collapse.\n\nSlice and Dice look down on the Star Paladins as they lay dead, Dice speaking in a quiet voice, 'They betrayed us, Slice.'

Many of you spread lies of murder, of betrayal, of deceit, you claim that I am an evil mastermind who has overseen an illegal coup. You have one part right. I am a mastermind. Cottage Cheese was old and frail, and died from a cough, and as the only pony willing to take charge, I stepped up to lead our Contingent towards strength. Your ilk have seen fit to stand in the way of this strength, you believe that resisting me was right. But all that led to was death. Death of you traitors, death of your leaders, death of good, loyal Steel Rangers, needless, pointless death.

River Autumn, Grand Marshal of the New Equestrian Enclave, stands before the great machine, 'A supercomputer. I've read about these before in ancient books, but I was unaware any were actually produced. Yet this computer apparently killed its Stable to preserve resources, I can see why they weren't used very much.'\n\n Autumn steps around, looking at the many screens, her eyes discerning the lines of code, 'Hmm. This code is odd, it doesn't look like the normal data a terminal would put out. It's almost like the code is alive.' She pauses, looking at the glowing green screens again, 'Cottage Cheese's secret project. That old fool was looking to use a supercomputer to preserve his own life!' She cracks out a laugh, 'He thought that he could upload his consciousness? That old fool, he'd die long, long before he could understand an ounce of this code!' She pauses, and looks at the screens again, smirking softly, 'I will admit, though, I would have enjoyed figuring out how to make that work.'\n\n A scribe approaches her, 'Elder, what should we do with the terminal? Should we keep it?' Autumn smirks more, 'I'd rather not keep a murderous supercomputer around for long. Unlike the ancient Elder, I'm not looking to prolong my life. Scrap the machine, turn it into smaller terminals, use the remaining parts for study and to craft new weapons.'"

  MSR.132.desc:0 "'My fellow ponies of the Manehattan Contingent, this is your Elder speaking to you upon this fine day.' River Autumn stands on a balcony, overlooking Bucklyn, her voice carrying over radios to every corner of Manehattan, 'For a long time, I have spoken on a strong contingent, I have spoken on a realm where ponies can live fear from fear, hunger, and death. This is still my promise, but no longer will we be held back by our titles. We are no longer Steel Rangers, and no longer am I your Elder. From this moment henceforth, I declare the Manehattan Contingent to be dissolved!'\n\n A roar of cheers comes from below, but with a single motion of the hoof, they stop, as she continues to speak, 'Steel Rangers are a organization kept only to a lucky few, the Steel Rangers are technophiles obsessed with saving technology over saving lives. They are hermits who speak softly and wear powered armor. But no longer will we be this. No longer will we hide in our bunkers as the world passes us by! Out there, day by day, ponies are born and die, they starved they die of easily preventable diseases, or raiders, and their leaders do nothing! What is the hope for the Wasteland to be? A southern republic who promises freedom, but changes nothing? Or a marauding empire of slavers who promise prosperity, yet clasp their own ponies in chains? Perhaps it's in the Pegasi up above, too cowardly to return to the surface? No! Equestria shall no longer languish under these groups, letting ponies die day by day!'\n\n With a deep breath in, Autumn grins, 'From this day on, I am no longer Elder of the Manehattan Contingent. I am Grand Marshal of the New Equestrian Enclave, a central state ruled by technology, by strength, for the benefit of all! Hear me ponies of Equestria and rejoice, for I am coming for you! You may raise arms, you may fight against me, but progress, prosperity, and peace are coming by a hoof of steel! You will be fed, you will have houses, and work, you will life lives like no pony in the last two hundred years! Equestria died in ashes, but like a Phoenix, Equestria will come again! Stronger!

  MSR_aj_rangers.1.desc:0 "Word has gone out all across our ranks: Elder Cottage Cheese has been incapacitated, many of our brothers and sisters have been slain, and a revolution has spread through our Contingent. On both sides, forces muster and prepare to wage bloody warfare against one another. Already, lines are being drawn and the most zealous are launching raids against the opposing faction, trying to bring about their victory as quickly as they possibly can.\n\nWithin the halls of Bucklyn Cross, a new form of leadership is already forming. A select few have assumed roles of leadership, working together to try to reunify the Rangers. They work tirelessly to secure what is left of their territory, with the eventual goal of ending what they view as an unjust coup.\n\nAcross the river, the self-described 'Applejack's Rangers' are quickly organizing themselves into their own Contingent. Following the example of their Elder, they all zealously fight for ideals thought to be long dead. They won't stop until the Steel Rangers have abandoned the Mission they have held for so long and instead set down a new path.\n\nOnly time will tell which side emerges victorious in this conflict. Either way, the future of the Steel Rangers may very well be decided by its outcome."

  MSR_aj_rangers.2.title:0 "Crossroads' Trial"
  MSR_aj_rangers.2.desc:0 "Star Paladin Crossroads had once been one of the most respected members of our Contingent. Despite her association with the evidently traitorous Steelhooves, few ever dared question her loyalty to our Mission and the firmness with which she upheld her Oaths. Indeed, had she stayed true to our cause, she likely would have been declared Elder in the absence of Cottage Cheese. No betrayal shocked us more than hers, and few did more damage to the unity of our Contingent. Now, she stands trial before a Council of those who once served under her, those who once looked up to her as a shining example of what a Paladin should be.\n\nLooking throughout the room, Crossroad's felt little but disgust. She remembered when these ponies were but foals in training, still needing help to clean their guns. Now here they stood, playing at being Elders. And there was Stonewall, the ringleader of them all. Though he betrayed no hints of it, she had little doubt that he was overjoyed to see her put low like this. They had never seen eye to eye, with him often questioning her orders or choosing to interpret them in a rather creative way. Now, he stood as the judge presiding over her fate, with the rest of the Council being the jury. No doubt they'd just go along with whatever he declared.\n\nThe silence that had filled the room was broken, as the stallion who was the present target of Crossroad's glare began to speak.\n\n'Star Paladin Crossroads. Though I don't find you worthy of such a title, it is still your right until the conclusion of this trial. You stand accused of the following: Treason, murder, sedition, theft of equipment, crimes in violation of the Code of Steel, crimes in violation of the Sunrise Accord, crimes against the Princesses and equinekind, and of being an accomplice in the overthrow of Elder Cottage Cheese. In light of these crimes, and of near limitless unlisted offences, this Council has revoked your right to a defence, as is our power as granted by the Wartime Emergency Response Mandate. Should you be found guilty, all honors shall be removed from your name, you will be stricken from the record, and you will be sentenced to death for your crimes. The Council will now decide your fate.'\n\nIt took only a few seconds before the first Paladin weighed in, with a sure decree of 'guilty.' This was quickly followed by another verdict. Paladin Banana Nut took a moment to glance around the room, before giving a thoroughly nonreassuring apologetic look at her former superior and joining her compatriots.\n\n'With that, it is the ruling of this Council that you are guilty of all charges brought against you. Your execution will be carried out immediately, as such is befitting of the severity of your crimes. May the Princesses have mercy upon your soul.'\n\nThe end of the trial came quickly in the form of a laser beam, shot from the rifle of one of the Knights standing to either side of Crossroads. The dust hadn't even settled before the Council disbanded, sending all those gathered back to their duties."

  MSR_aj_rangers.3.desc:0 "A new front has opened in our war to make the Wasteland a better place, as the pegasi have broken their centuries long isolation to descend upon us from above. Refugees have begun to flood across Manehattan, many of them seeking refuge within our territory or even going beyond to get as far away from the Enclave menace as possible. Rumors are already spreading of countless atrocities being committed on the eastern end of our fair city, with entire settlements being razed to the ground and numerous innocents being killed on sight.\n\nIn light of this greater threat to not just our own survival, but the survival of all of ponykind, the idea has been proposed to seek a temporary truce with the rest of the Contingent. Though it doesn't sit well with many, none can deny that we have suddenly found ourselves with far higher priorities than reunification. Surely, they would similarly be able to see the reason in putting aside our differences to face this common threat."

  MSR_aj_rangers.4.title:0 "A Ceasefire?"
  MSR_aj_rangers.4.desc:0 "Today, a skirmish between us and the traitors calling themselves 'Applejack's Rangers' unexpectedly turned into a diplomatic summit. A group of traitors waving a white flag approached one of our outposts, requesting to parley with us. Despite our initial hopes, it seems they were not there to surrender, but rather to present an offer for a truce between our two factions. An offer which was relayed to Bucklyn Cross with all due haste via the nearest radio.\n\nThe Council is uncertain as to how to deal with this offer. Though it can't be denied that the Enclave presents a unique threat to us, we aren't entirely convinced that they are anywhere near dangerous enough to warrant putting off our ongoing effort to reunify our Contingent. After all, what could be more important than the future of the Steel Rangers? Certainly not defending raiders and ignorant scavengers from some boogeyman from above the clouds.\n\nHowever, many of the reports we receive from other parts of Manehattan are troubling. Though we have been unable to send out scouts to confirm any of these reports due to the ongoing war, we have witnessed the Enclave's cloudcraft flying overhead and their soldiers swarming across the sky. Their forces do appear formidable and they haven't gained a reputation for being reasonable during their invasion.\n\nBesides, even if we did agree to the truce now, we can always return to our reunification efforts once this new external threat has been dealt with. With that in mind, the Council must reach a decision..."

However, we must be prepared for hostilities to resume as soon as the pegasus invasion is dealt with."

It seems that they were accepted into one of our rival's outposts and their message was successfully relayed back to Bucklyn Cross. After a while, a response was given in the form of an attempted ambush with the goal of killing or capturing our entire envoy.\n\nQuick thinking by one of our Knights led to them breaking through a conveniently thin wall that had been ready to collapse after two centuries of wear.\n\nThankfully, they managed to make their way back to us from there in only slightly worse condition than when they first departed. Though this attempt on their lives was nothing short of disgraceful, it has made their response to our truce loud and clear."

  MSR_aj_rangers.7.desc:0 "When word had come to us that the so-called 'Applejack's Rangers' wanted to meet us for a prisoner exchange, we had thought this to present a great opportunity to gain a few new prisoners of our own. An ambush was prepared, with our forces being believed to be more than enough to pull off a rescue and capture operation at once. Unfortunately, the plan was derailed immediately by the unexpected presence of the Stable Dweller.\n\nPaladin Stonewall looked across the carnage with a look of barely contained disgust. Even worse than the dead were the dying, many of his best Knights and Paladins injured to the point where their fates were sealed. Word had already reached him of the work of this so-called 'Hellmare', who was allegedly responsible for most of this death. He hadn't believed the reports at first, but here was the evidence in front of him.\n\nEven worse, they had lost their best chance to get their Elder back. They weren't sure what condition he was in, but even his corpse would have been better than nothing. A proper funeral for the old stallion would at least remind his forces what they were fighting for. Stonewall would have made sure that whoever had allowed this disaster to happen was reprimanded, if they weren't currently one of the many bullet-strewn corpses being thrown into the body pile.\n\nTurning his back on the scene, the Paladin sighed as he began to trot away. The rumor mill was already going wild, tales of a 8-foot tall mare with flames surrounding her infesting the nightmares of his Rangers. He'd have to address the situation and reassure them that they weren't fighting a literal demon straight from the Pits of Tartarus. Even if he wasn't so sure of that himself."

We were left in the dark as to what the nature of their delay was, until it very loudly made itself clear today on the border between our territory and that of the traitors.\n\nAn ongoing skirmish between our forces was interrupted this morning by the nearby water treatment facility being quite destructively removed from its foundations. The battle was brought to a temporary halt, as both sides expected the other to be trying something. To the surprise of both, what emerged was a small army of Rangers with the insignias of the Hoofington Contingent, still visible despite the grime and filth covering their armor.\n\nThe new arrivals wasted no time in turning against our foes, laying down fire upon them and pushing them back. Though our own forces were too disoriented by the sudden shift to press the offensive, they did manage to regroup in time to secure our lines once more. The leader of these Rangers quickly identified themselves as Paladin Sugar Toffee and explained that they had to move through the labyrinthian Manehattan sewer system to get around enemy lines, due to the Applejack's Rangers control over the rivers coming into the city.\n\nWith allies like these on our side, we have no doubt that this war will be brought to a swift conclusion before too long."

Fighting with some distance between our fortifications and our main base of operations would be far more comfortable than holding off an army from right outside of our headquarters.\n\nAlternatively, we can also go through and pick the ruins clean. We're sure that our new lands are likely full of technology, useful salvage, and plentiful supplies.

Suddenly, the conference door opened, with an uneasy air of authority beginning to sweep in. "Paladins." Banana Nut raised her head upon hearing the stoic voice. "Paladin Stonewall," the three saluted the stallion, although Stonewall only chose to stare at Banana Nut, the pony with the most worried expression on the table. "Sorry, just... deep in thought." she replied. "Yeah, you're not alone," Ginger Root interjected. "This has probably been the longest week of my life." \n\n"I know you all feel that way," Stonewall said calmly. "I... do as well." It took him a moment to recall everything that had occurred, but Stonewall focused once more. "But we need to be realistic about our options. The situation has changed drastically since last time we met." Even if it was an obvious statement to make, some level of confidence was better than none, and Stonewall knew this well. "Right now, the Steel Rangers need leadership. With the Elder dead-" \n\n"What? You want me to lead?" Banana Nut exclaimed.\n\n"Not just you, Paladin. Each of us, together. While individually we may never come close to reaching the Elder's experience, perhaps together we can form the level of leadership that our contingent most desperately needs." The confidence in his words batted away the timid air that filled the room. It was this stoic charisma that made the other three Paladins respect him so. "A council of Paladins..." Scotch Brite muttered, almost grinning at the thought. "We'll have to work out the details later," Stonewall continued. "But for now, I think it's best if we waste no time and form the council. We've got a lot of ground to cover before we can call ourselves leaders. And even if it's just temporary, we're now dealing with the same Rangers that we once shared paths with. The first step is to fill in the void left by the death of the Elder." He looked around the table and saw nods of agreement.\n\n"Ginger, Scotch, Banana, join me in leading our Steel Rangers."\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Ginger nodded and stood up, giving Stonewall a strong salute. Scotch then followed suit. Banana Nut, however, remained seated. She seemed to have trouble looking at Stonewall in the eye. "I don't mean to interrupt your plans or anything, but... I'm not fit to lead like this." she admitted. Stonewall thought of what to say for a moment, and then turned to the worried mare. "Paladin, you were always the most levelheaded pony here. After seeing how much you cared for Cottage Cheese, you deserve the chance to show everyone that you can be trusted with the responsibility to lead us."

Already, lines were being drawn and allegiances were being declared, as our entire Contingent quickly descended into chaos. That is, until the intervention of Star Paladin Steelhooves, supported by Star Paladin Crossroads. Together, they managed to peacefully gather the most influential ponies from across the Contingent. Scribe, Paladin, and Knight alike were all brought together to discuss the future of the Steel Rangers.\n\nInitially, this was a heated affair. Tempers ran high and disaster seemed inevitable, until evidence of what Cottage Cheese was actually trying to accomplish was brought to the room. The old Elder, in his madness, had sought to achieve the impossible: Immortality. Such an idea was initially outright rejected, with many of those who had faithfully served Cottage Cheese for decades insisting that it was nothing but lies meant to slander his good name. However, as more evidence was brought forward and more pieces were connected regarding his odd behavior, many of the Rangers who had been on the borderline began to see the truth in the matter.\n\nNeedless to say, the common opinion of our now former Elder shifted dramatically. Outside of a few holdouts who insisted upon his innocence, most of the influential ponies within the Contingent have conceded to the reality of the situation: That Cottage Cheese was insane and was attempting to upload himself to a machine in a desperate attempt to extend his dwindling lifespan. With the true nature of his obsession successfully conveyed to those who had been ready to tear the Contingent apart over his removal, we were simply left with the question of who to look to for leadership now.\n\nA question which was answered in the form of Steelhooves himself, who despite being a divisive figure, has the most support of anypony in our ranks as the new Elder. The only counter proposal issued against him was an idea by Paladin Stonewall to form a 'Council' of sorts, which was quickly disregarded by most of those present as a pointless breach of tradition.\n\nWith that out of the way, Steelhooves has officially become the Elder of the Manehattan Contingent."

Most of them are well past their primes, but we must take what we can get in these trying times, and besides, isn't it the spirit that matters anyways?\n\nChief among this crowd of old volunteers is one Major Napalm, and while technically a scribe, his accomplishments are more than enough to justify a command position. The Major is infamous among the lower ranks as being the most crotchety, confrontational son-of-a-mule you'd ever have the displeasure of meeting, and his well known love of pyrotechnics was matched only by his devotion to Cottage Cheese.

Paladin Shortcake, this is Knight Mango Slice, requesting immediate assistance, we are three klicks west of Steelhooves' Shack, I repeat, three klicks west, we require immediate assistance."\n\n From his vantage point, Dice takes a deep breath in, watching as a massive group of ponies, some in power armor, rush right under the building, hounded by Rain Riders, "Three floors, I can do that." With all four legs, he jumps from the ledge, crashing down on one of the Rain Rider cars, right on the hood, flipping the entire vehicle over, crushing the raiders inside. Uninjured from the fall, Dice spins to face the oncoming vehicles, minigun immediately spinning up, firing a hail of bullets. They tear through the unarmored bodies of the raiders, and right through their vehicles, splattering the asphalt with blood and viscera, causing a huge pile-up on the narrow road.\n\n The Rain Riders, seeing the sudden resistance, bring their vehicles to a halt, looking to a large central vehicle. A semi-truck with a stallion sat inside, the raid leader, who revs the engine of his vehicle. Before he can charge, though, the sound of a anti-machine rifle tears through the air, and right through the semi, exploding it in a massive fiery explosion, lighting all ammunition on board the vehicle. Slice watches from on high, racking a new bullet into the chamber, watching as the raiders turn tail and flee.\n\n With that, Dice turns to face the friendlies, seeing a large group of haggard and injured ponies, "Who are you?" He notices the symbol of the Fillydelphia Contingent on a few of their pieces of armor, "Fillydelphia? Why are you up here? Where's the rest of you?" One of the ponies, nursing a bullet wound, responds after a second, "We're all that's left. Fillydelphia fell. We're here to help, Brother.""

They enjoy tending to themselves and rarely meddle in outside affairs, and they've even established themselves an honorable reputation of being respectable hunters. Very hospitable to anypony who happens by, no problem has ever seen to have arisen from those ponies. The strangest thing to come from any report seems that they nearly all share the same mark on their flanks. Other than that... is a town like Arbu a reasonable cause for these rumors? Or does it hurt to simply have an actually normal town for once?\n\nThe former question seems to be brought up quite often, and as frequently as the question is asked, it's always answered with the same rumors. The same rumors that they eat their own. Rumors that the townsponies of Arbu are kind and hospitable on the outside, but how they secretly consume meals that come directly from the very same flesh that makes them. There's been at least one old report from a pony who scouted the town with these rumors in mind, only to return with nothing to confirm these suspicions.\n\nSoon after, formal permissions for an investigation were to be sent out to try to follow on these rumors, only for the ponies at Arbu to respond back in quite the repulsive manner. Even then, any pony accused of cannibalism would rightfully respond in disgust... and in good reason. To our eyes, there are no reports of them harming or killing any friendly ponies, and seem to fend off from their own share of mutants and raiders every now and then. In fact, they may even go so far as to hunt down troublemakers for the sake of protecting those who visit their town in fear or desperation.\n\nThese rumors seem to be causing quite the stir, is it rightful to step in and see if they are true?"

They're savages, and must be dealt with, sooner or later. Nearly every building in Arbu holds a basement underneath, all emanating the same foul stench. These basements are always locked, and until now have been kept hidden from the outside world. These basements act as the butcheries of Arbu. It's these butcheries that no doubt give the cannibals of Arbu their meat, the same meat that comes from the innocent ponies they no doubt hunt down and capture, only to lock them away to soon be carved up and eaten.\n\nTurns out those rumors were right after all."

She looks over her gathered legions, a force larger and more well-organized than any force she had seen before, beyond the wildest dreams of even the most optimistic Steel Ranger. Thus, with a cast of a spell on her throat, she would speak loud enough to be heard by all.\n\n "Soldiers! For too long has our nation been tied down by our past, by our connection to the Steel Rangers, and their flawed systems of war! Rangers rejected all who were not one of them, and they fought for only one thing, and that was greed! But no longer, no longer will we fight wars to line the pockets of those above us! No longer will good mares, stallions, cocks and hens march to their death pointlessly! From this day onward, our armed forces is the Equestrian Freedom Army, and with bullets, and with bombs, and with blood and with bodies will we bring justice, freedom, and prosperity to every pony in the wasteland! We are no band of conscripts and mercenaries like the southern republic! We are no band of barbaric xenophobes like the Grand Pegasus Enclave! We are not a roving horde of raiders like Red Eye!

It feels weird, not being in the barracks anymore." She takes a second, before speaking softly, "I keep on thinking about that time we stormed the armory. When River Autumn was stood right there, and I had a loaded gun. I could have killed her."\n\n Dice takes a small bite of bread, looking at her and placing the bread right back down, "You aren't to blame for Crossroads, or Steelhooves, we were just following orders." She frowns softly, "We didn't have to. We could have disobeyed. But we obeyed, like... like tin soldiers." Dice sighs softly and leans back, "Look around you at everything she's done, Slice. I know you liked Steelhooves, but he's gone, even if there are rumors of him being spotted. The Grand Marshal has given everyone work, she's brought back factories, given us a house, and food, and something worth fighting for, Slice. The Speedfreak I stopped was a slaver, and if it wasn't for her, if I was still a Ranger, I wouldn't have thought twice about them. But now? Now they’re free, they have food, and a job, and a life, just like us. I fought for Cottage Cheese because I swore an oath. I fight for Autumn because she's done good, and I want to do good too."\n\n Slice sighs and looks down, "I know. I just keep thinking about it. About Crossroads, and Steelhooves, and every pony I've killed in service to her. Is all this blood really worth it?" She looks back up, "I hear that there are some schools opening up, in need of teachers. They're accepting any Ranger educated ponies immediately. Why don't we retire, go live our lives away from everything?" Dice sits up and looks at her, "Because if I'm not out there, then someone else will be.

Death to your systems, death to your oppression, death to your false promises. For the republics who offer democracy, but never truly count the votes casted, I offer death. To the slavers and mercenary bands, whose whips and machine guns score the flesh of the innocent, I offer death. To the military of the pegasi above, who seek to steal away the Sun, our birthright, I offer death. I am coming, I, and my armies, are coming for you.\n\nAnd for those petty tyrants and false prophets, you may try and run, you may try and hide, but there is no corner in Equestria that I will not scour. To those who fight, I make an offer. When you see my armies, take the arms forced upon you by your overlords, lay them down, and surrender. Prosperity, freedom, and peace to all.

Equestria is a fragile thing, if you don't believe me, then look at the ashes around you. Years ago, here in this city, slaves rose up against Red Eye, demanding their freedom and their rights, but Red Eye crushed them. Many see me as much the same, but they are wrong. For all throughout my Equestria, ponies wake up every day with bellies full of food. They go to jobs and earn living wages, they spend time with friends, and family. They send foals off to schools and live in the shadows of hospitals, ready to stop any disease. No longer do ponies have to worry about raiders riding through their town. Some say I take away freedom, but I ask you, where is the freedom in starving to death in a democracy? Where is the freedom in cowering every day in a lawless anarchy? I offer freedom to each, and every, pony, and I offer the ability to exercise the freedom. I fight against tyrants and here, in the city of tyrants, I give to you all an oath."\n\n From behind her a loyal scribe approaches, offering a silver circlet, which she floats around her neck, "This circlet is made from the remnants of Red Eye's cybernetic eye, the tyrant of all tyrants. And I tell this to each and every one of you. As long as I wear this necklace, Equestria will remain prosperous, Equestria will remain free, and every pony will be prosperous!"

This is because ponies are herd animals, they want a shepherd who will lead them."\n\n A class of attentive foals sits in the Alpha-Omega Hotel, listening intently to River Autumn as she speaks, "Doctor Ion Chandelier, inventor of the psychology of sustainability, wrote about a concept in his writings. Immortality projects. When a pony rejects their connection to nature, their moral nature, and instead seek to control and bend nature to their will, they use immortality projects. Environmental destruction, murder, genocide, war, all of these are often used as immortality projects, to try and forever leave a pony's name in history. Red Eye did much wrong, but one thing he never did wrong, was teach you foals. Indeed, it was a good action he did by teaching you all, but for the wrong intentions, for it was an immortality project."\n\n A Pegasus student scribbles a few notes in a small book as she steps amidst the students, looking each of them in the eyes as she trots past, "But I am not a pony to deny my mortality.

Knight Mango Dice and Knight Hailstorm stand side by side, their miniguns roaring, firing hundreds of bullets into the encroaching horde.

Paladin Shortcake barks orders from the center of the defenses, watching as two knights turn their attention skywards, where a flock of Alicorns bears down upon them. Knight Flak, a large cannon on his side, fires flak into the air, shrapnel sending a few Alicorns down to the ground before their shields can be raised. Knight Chaser steps forward and lights her horn up, magic missiles flying through the air, in hot pursuit of Alicorns. However, lasers from the front would hit against their armor, distracting them from their quarries.\n\n "Clankers, front! Knight Slice, Knight Mannequin, take them out!"

Knight Slice begins to fire her anti-machine rifle, rending through the armor of the machines, while Knight Mannequin begins to shoot lasers right back at them. A loud scream fills the air, as an Alicorn lands a hit right against Knight Chaser's visor, breaking it open, allowing the toxic Pink Cloud to flood her armor. With a moment's pause, Shortcake turns and fires her gun right into the open visor, ending the screams early, "Keep shooting! Hold this position or we're all dead!"\n\nThe sounds of gunfire continue for minutes more, until slowly, all guns come to a stop. The skies are clear as the Alicorns fly back to the palace, losing a few of their number to the attack. The ghouls are nothing more than a pile of flesh and blood on the road, while the robots lay in a heap of scrap. All Rangers turn to look at Knight Chaser, as Paladin Shortcake leans in to her body.

Dice, still within his armor, hisses at her, "What are you doing? We're not supposed to take off our armor!" Slice looks back at him with a small glare, and then at the filly.

Now, ponies from all backgrounds work side by side in a small workshop they've gifted her, where she can teach them all the basics of mechanical and electronic maintenance. She watches the ponies of Friendship City as they give her smiles, and she gives them a bright, beaming smile back."

  MSR_chemevent.13.desc:0 "Mango Slice trots down the streets of Friendship, surrounded by foals who run between her legs, playing with toys fixed up by their parents. Shop owners, with rebuilt shops, give her waves and smiles as she passes by, and she returns them. Up above, the sun is dim behind the clouds, but down below, it's brighter than it's been in over two hundred years.\n\n She trots up to the Statue of Friendship, where Mango Slice stands, a nasty bruise on his side, ordering around some teams of mechanics, "Team B, try and get up to the torch, be safe though! Team C, assist, and Team D, be on lookout, make sure the mechanics don't fail!" Slice trots up next to him, chuckling, "So, what happened to 'we're not supposed to be out of our armor', huh?" He looks over and rolls his eyes slightly, "Yeah, yeah. Can you blame me? You always warm up to ponies quicker than me." He motions to another team, who lifts up polished green metal plate, beginning to fuse it into the statue, while Slice grins, "Seem pretty warm to me."\n\n The two watch in silence, until Slice speaks again, "I didn't know my classes would lead all the way to this." Dice looks over and grins, "You're a natural teacher. One foal's broken toy, and now your lessons are rebuilding the whole Statue of Friendship." She nods, looking up, as a team of ponies in a crane slowly lower a new addition onto the statue, a Stetson hat, "Yeah. That mare the Elder talks about, the one that hat comes from, I wonder how much of what he says is true, and how much is mythology."\n\n Dice looks up, as the final touches are added to the statue, "I don't know, and I don't really care. I'm happy, and you're happy." The two look on as the sun begins to set over the ocean. The Statue of Friendship, stood tall and proud with freshly polished green metal adorning her, a stetson hat on her head, and a torch, looks into the distance."

  MSR_chemevent.14.t:0 "Not Reason Alone"
  MSR_chemevent.14.desc:0 "Mango Slice sits in her small workshop, helping teach the ponies there how to put things back together, though no matter how hard she tries, she can't get into the swing of teaching again. Ever since Dice left months ago, she's felt like she's missing a part of herself, after all, the siblings have never been apart for too long. But she's made friends in this city, friends who have helped her through these times, and helped bring a bit of brightness back to her smile. All brightness, however, would disappear as the door to her workshop opens, and a pony calls to her, "Slice, there's some Rangers approaching, they asked for you."\n\n With a small sigh, she gets up, and trots through the city, where shop owners in mostly repaired buildings watch on, and milita with shaky aim give her reassuring nods, though they are nervous themselves. She reaches the front gate, seeing a group of three Rangers, enough on their own to destroy the town if they truly wanted. At their head is Mango Dice, who looks upon his sibling from behind an armored visor, "Slice, it's time to go home, the Elder isn't going to wait any longer. I know you care for these ponies, but you aren't helping them by wasting your talents here. We're Steel Rangers, Slice, we keep the Wasteland safe, we don't rebuild it."\n\n Slice looks at him with a small, defiant glare, "If that's what Steel Rangers are, then I'm not a Steel Ranger, Dice. Steelhooves was right, what use is protecting ponies if we don't help them? I'm more than a trotting gun, I can do more, so much more, than Crossroads could ever imagine. In five years, the Statue of Friendship will be rebuilt, her torch lit, a beacon of what we could have been, because of me. And if you're here to bring me back one way or another." She sighs out, looking down, and then looking up, "Then you'll be bringing me back to Crossroads dead. This is my home now, and I'm going to protect it to my last breath from bullies like the Rangers."\n\n Dice looks at his sister for a long, silent minute, before he looks away, "Okay. I understand, and I'm not going to stop you. I might not agree, but you're my sister, and I would never harm you. I. I might not be able to see you again." He takes a deep, shuddering breath, before letting it out, "I love you, Slice." She stands, tall, before she looks away, "I love you, Dice. Goodbye.""

  MSR_chemevent.15.t:0 "A Broadcast from Manehattan"
  MSR_chemevent.15.desc:0 ""Greetings, ponies of Equestria, and beyond. I’m sure many of you have heard the news that we, the New Equestrian Enclave, have liberated Tenpony Tower from those who ruled over it. Many of you were likely worried that your music would play no longer, but worry not, all the tunes you're sick of will play again. I am Grand Marshal River Autumn, and I invite you all to listen closely."\n\n"To the slaves of Fillydelphia, to the abused of the New Canterlot Republic, to all pegasi, ponies, griffons, thestrals, or even alicorns who hear this, I promise one thing. Freedom. Freedom from hunger, from deprivation, freedom from danger, and sickness, and death. Freedom to live a safe, prosperous life. To the false prophets of the Wastes, to Gawd, to Red Eye, or whatever underling might be listening, to the Goddess, and to any other pony who seeks to oppress your population, I promise this. Death. Death to your systems, death to your oppression, death to your false promises. For the republics who offer democracy, but never truly count the votes casted, I offer death. To the slavers and mercenary bands, whose whips and machine guns score the flesh of the innocent, I offer death. To the military of the pegasi above, who seek to steal away the Sun, our birthright, I offer death. I am coming, I, and my armies, are coming for you."\n\n"And for those petty tyrants and false prophets, you may try and run, you may try and hide, but there is no corner in Equestria that I will not scour. To those who fight, I make an offer. When you see my armies, take the arms forced upon you by your overlords, lay them down, and surrender. Prosperity, freedom, and peace to all. Until we next meet, ponies of Equestria, this is where I sign off.""

His leadership has always been a highly conservative one, with the Rangers doing little more than pursuing their mission under his steady rule. Because of this, he has become to many the glue that holds the Steel Rangers together.\n\nHowever, recent years have seen his rulership increasingly challenged. First by the Scribes under River Autumn and now by naive idealists inspired by tales of heroism from out in the Wasteland. Elder Cottage Cheese will have to play his cards carefully if he wishes to remain in power for the foreseeable future."

  POLITICS_RIVERAUTUMN_DESC:0 "Little is known about River Autumn's rise to power beyond the conditions surrounding it being suspicious at best. Many whisper of her being a murderer, a Brotherslayer, and far worse, although none would dare speak it where she could overhear.\n\nHer rulership has already proven to be stern, in a manner far more threatening than her predecessor ever could of achieved. Of those that disapoint her, they are lucky if they are only cast down the ranks. Those who truly anger her often have a habit of either disappearing or being found guilty of a severe offence against the Contingent.\n\nAs the Steel Rangers move into the future, they will grow to fear their own leader more than any threat that could exist outside of their fortified walls."
  
  POLITICS_GRANDMARSHALRIVER_DESC:0 "Grand Marshal Autumn is considered one of the most feared mares in the Equestrian Wasteland. Her rule is in equal measure benevolent and absolute, with few daring to even slightly step out of line lest they attract their rulers wrath. With a power-armored army under her command and an ambition greater than any of her predecessors could dream of, her rule will have an impact on Equestria for generations to come."
  
  POLITICS_STEELHOOVES_DESC:0 "Elder Steelhooves is hooves-down the oldest member of the entirety of the Steel Rangers as well as being one of the most respected. He was outside of Canterlot on the day that the world ended, aiding in the evacuation efforts in Zebratown and surrounding communities. When the Pink Cloud poured down from the ruins of the capital city above, Steelhooves would be among those directly exposed to the necromantic toxin.\n\nAs a direct result of his exposure, he became fused to his armor and was turned into a Canterlot ghoul. This has rendered him effectively immortal and extraordinarily difficult to kill, leading to him becoming a valued advisor and soldier to the Steel Rangers in equal measure.\n\nAs a result of his experiences out in the Wasteland, Steelhooves has grown more idealistic than what many expected. His return to the Manehattan Contingent was quickly followed by a political power struggle, one which he has come out on top of. With the contingent stabilized again, he seeks to reform the Steel Rangers to follow the ideals of their founder and his once-upon-a-time lover, Ministry Mare Applejack."
  
  POLITICS_CROSSROADS_DESC:0 "Where Steelhooves was idealistic, Crossroads is practical. Where he was ambitious, she is realistic. Where he was an awe-inspiring figure, she is little more than just another Steel Ranger.\n\nHowever, she has found herself now in command of the Manehattan Contingent. Her policies are often more conservative than her predecessors, which has made her an appealing option to many of those who still held sympathies towards Elder Cottage.\n\nDespite the uncertain future that appears to face the Steel Rangers, she is determined to make sure that they come out intact on the other side."
