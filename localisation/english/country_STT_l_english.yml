STT_glory_afe_desc:0 "This war may have cost us dearly, but it was worth it for the continued survival of the AFE and Stable 32. With the entirety of stable now under our control, it is time for us to begin rebuilding our once fractured lives."

STT_new_way:0 "A New Way Forward"
STT_new_way_desc:0 "We failed to prevent the Great War because we failed to take the initiative. If Equestria had focused more of her resources on advancing scientific research rather than war mongering, then we could have created the means to prevent the war from ever happening."
STT_talk_com:0 "Talk to the Committee"
STT_talk_com_desc:0 "The heads of all the major scientific departments, along with any extra personnel deemed necessary, shuffled their way into the small auditorium for another round of boring meetings.

STT_unrest_amongus:0 "Unrest Among the Populous"
STT_unrest_amongus_desc:0 "Even after the six hour war and the formal surrender of the AFE, many of its ponies are still attempting to fight on by any means necessary. They must be made to understand that they have lost."
STT_info_wars:0 "Knowledge Truly is Power"
STT_info_wars_desc:0 "Who says scientist can’t win wars; we surely disproved that. After too long, Stable 32 stands united once again. For the first time in over two generations, we feel like we have the chance to truly rebuild what was broken all those years ago."

STT_balance_act:0 "Balancing Act"
STT_balance_act_desc:0 "This senseless fighting has done nothing but ruin what was once a prosperous stable. If we want to even have a chance of leaving this vault and returning to the surface than we must put aside our differences and begin working together as one."
STT_opening_chan:0 "Opening Channels"
STT_opening_chan_desc:0 "If we can convince ponies from both sides of the stable to meet one another and converse, it would help to show that we aren’t so different after all."
STT_hand_pamph:0 "Handing out Pamphlets"
STT_hand_pamph_desc:0 "We must do our best to spread our ideas around to the ponies of Stable 32. If we can get even just a few of them to read what we have to say, it will be a step in the right direction."
STT_speech_mass:0 "A Speech to the Masses"

STT_meet_phial_desc:0 "To our surprise, Dr. Phial agreed to meet with us without any issue. If only Moudry Star was so easy to convince."
STT_crisis_averted:0 "Conflict Avoided"
STT_crisis_averted_desc:0 "It was thought to have been impossible to achieve, but we did it. Stable 32 has been reunited under a single banner after over 200 years of constant divisions. Though there are still many who are wary of this new found unity, the future of this stable is looking very bright."

STT_stable_opens:0 "The Stable Door Opens"

STT_techrax:0 "Scrap Their ‘Precious’ Technology"
STT_techrax_desc:0 "The Scientific Committee had quite the number of fancy gadgets and strange doohickeys in their part of the stable. It seems like such a waste to build such seemingly useless devices that serve no real purpose. But, lucky for us, we can at least use many of the materials they were made of for a much better purpose."
STT_penal:0 "Put the Prisoners to Work"
STT_penal_desc:0 "Many of the former ponies of the Scientific Bloc of Stable 32 now sit around under the watchful guard of the AFE. However, we feel that this perpetual laziness will do no good for them. So, we decided to put many of them to work doing menial task in order to give them something to do besides sit around all day."
STT_more_fac:0 "Increase Our Industrial Output"
STT_more_fac_desc:0 "Even with all the workshops and factories we have built over the years, the demand for equipment and goods continues to rise. If we don’t wish to fall behind the growing demands, we must commit to increasing every factory output by at least ten-fold."
STT_all_hooves:0 "All Hooves at the Ready"
STT_all_hooves_desc:0 "Our production lines are at full swing as every able-bodied pony puts in their hours to continue the ever-needed production for the push outwards.

STT_reorg:0 "Reorganizing Our Forces"
STT_reorg_desc:0 "The army of the AFE was built around urban and stable combat. However, with the outside now fully open to us, we must make sure that our forces are well prepared for the conditions they could potentially face beyond the stable door."
STT_stable_rec:0 "Stable Wide Recruitment Program"
STT_stable_rec_desc:0 "Our army is still relatively small and the size of the world outside is beyond that of the stable. If we want to ensure that we have enough soldiers to both defend Stable 32 and explore Equestria, then we need to begin recruiting more ponies into its ranks."
STT_riflemen:0 "A Rifle for Every Soldier"

STT_inc_log:0 "Increase Our Logistics"
STT_inc_log_desc:0 "Logistics is going to be a pain in the ass when most of the infrastructure is beyond repair. It may be seen as a waste of valuable resources, but building new roadways will allow our forces to move with ease and stay well supplied."
STT_warplans:0 "Review Our War Plans"
STT_warplans_desc:0 "Our current war plans are currently out of date or were only made with the stable in mind. Because of this, we are going to have had to begin drawing up new war plans that better fit the areas that we could potentially be fighting in."

STT_combots:0 "Create New Combat Robots"
STT_combots_desc:0 'With so few ponies joining the Security Force, we must supplement out numbers with robots. Since we have gained quite a large number of materials from the now defunct AFE, we can begin to use them to expand the number of combat robots we have."
STT_sim_train:0 "Simulated Training Programs"
STT_sim_train_desc:0 "To our luck, we found a few old combat simulation pods. With a bit of work, we could get these things working once more and use them to increase the amount of training our forces receive."
STT_drugs:0 "Enhanced Combat Stimulants"
STT_drugs_desc:0 "Some may see this as being unethical or as us attempting to play god, but this is sometimes the cost of perfecting science. Thanks to a number of ‘willing’ test subjects, we were able to create the ultimate combat serum. This should hopefully allow any pony to become a strong and able-bodied fighter."
STT_project_dix:0 "Project D-IX"
STT_project_dix_desc:0 "Some may see this as being unethical or as us attempting to play god, but this is sometimes the cost of perfecting science.

STT_china_moment:0 "Reeducate the Narrow Minded"
STT_china_moment_desc:0 "The entirety of the AFE thought that science was their enemy and have forced themselves to be stuck in some kind of primitive past. And though we are taught to respect other opinions, these ponies will only become useful to the stable if they are taught that science is a benefit and not a burden."
STT_bill_nye:0 "Invest in the Future of Science"
STT_bill_nye_desc:0 "Science is something that takes time; time that many of us don’t feasible have. If we wish for our life’s work to continue well after we pass on, we must make sure that there are those willing to take up the mantle."
STT_expand_sci:0 "Expand Research Capabilities"
STT_expand_sci_desc:0 "With the entire stable now open to us, we have the ability to expand many of research facilities. This will greatly benefit us in our continued pursuit of advanced knowledge."

STT_stable_defforce:0 "Create a Stable Defense Force"
STT_stable_defforce_desc:0 "With both the army of the AFE and the security forces of the Scientific Bloc having been disbanded, we must create a brand-new defense force in order to ensure the continued protection of Stable 32 from any threat from the surface."
STT_shore_def:0 "Shore Up Our Defenses"
STT_shore_def_desc:0 "In the stables haste to break out into a civil war, the two sides had built quite a lot of defensive installations throughout their respective sides of the stable. Lucky for us, we can repurpose those installations for the combined defense of Stable 32 itself."

STT_new_equip:0 "Invest in New Equipment"
STT_new_equip_desc:0 "The military equipment we currently have is either to old, too complex to understand, or to cheaply made. What we need is equipment that is both cost efficient, but also rugged enough to survive outside the stable. Let’s just hope the ponies in R&D can make that a reality."
STT_learn_wastes:0 "Learn About the Wasteland"
STT_learn_wastes_desc:0 "The Equestrian wasteland, as many locals seem to call it, is beyond anything we every though. It’s harsh conditions, nonexistent infrastructure, and ever abundant hazards can cause a multitude of problems for any large group trying to traverse it.

STT_reconcile:0 "Begin Reconciliation"
STT_reconcile_desc:0 "Even though the war was avoided, the divided stable is still . . . well, divided. It is going to take a long time before the two sides see eye to eye, but we must start somewhere if we ever hope of reaching that goal someday."

STT_rebuild:0 "Rebuilding Our Home"
STT_rebuild_desc:0 "Stable 32 has not looked like it once had for quite some time. Many of the shops and large common areas were turned into a demarcation zone that separated the two sides. But, with the end to all hostilities, we can begin to return these places back to what they were originally; a place to bring ponies together."
STT_moving_for:0 "Moving Forward"
STT_moving_for_desc:0 "We have done all we can to ensure that Stable 32 is on the right road to recovery, however, there isn’t much else we can do. At this point in time, all we can do now is to move forward."
STT_return_surface:0 "Return to the Surface"
STT_return_surface_desc:0 "It is time we fulfill what we were originally intended to do when our ancestors entered this vault.

One that, hopefully, will not follow the same mistakes we made in the past."

STT_mudburg:0 "The Mudburg Question"
STT_mudburg_desc:0 "Mudburg is home to a strange society of very primitive ponies who have little understanding of technology or of their past. They don’t seem to be a threat and could potentially be friendly towards us, however, they also seem unpredictable and could possibly turn against us."
STT_freeside:0 "Freeing Freeside"
STT_freeside_desc:0 "East of us lies a large group of ponies who call themselves Raiders. This rouge group of ruffians could potentially be a threat to the safety and security of Stable 32. Because of this, they must be swiftly dealt with before they take notice of us."
STT_stajnopolis:0 "Foundations of Stajnopolis"
STT_stajnopolis_desc:0 "Stable 32 has survived. It took a lot of work, but we did what was thought impossible and united as one.

These foundations shall be the beginnings a new nation in Equestria; the nation of Stanjnopolis."
STT_republican:0 "Proclaim a Stable Republic"
STT_republican_desc:0 "Stable 32 has been through a lot, but through the sheer will and determination of the AFE we have survived a bloody civil war and a mass exodus back to the surface. However, after all this existing work we must take some time to rest. During this time, we shall reorganize Stable 32 into a more proper nation. From this day forth, we shall be known as the First Stable Republic of Equestria. "
STT_technocrat:0 "Creating a New Scientific Institute"
STT_technocrat_desc:0 "Stable 32 has gone beyond what many of us had expected. Even with the civil war and a sudden return to the surface, science and reason has guided us through it all. With so many roads ahead of us, we must continue to work with diligence as we determine which road to take. This continuing need to expand our ever-growing research has been used as justification to found a brand-new scientific institute. One who’s sole devotion is to turn the wasteland into a paradise."
STT_rebuilding_equestria:0 "Rebuilding Equestria"
STT_rebuilding_equestria_desc:0 "Equestria lays in ruins. Bands of raiders and bandits attack anypony they can get their hooves on, while ponies struggle to survive the day. This will not do!

STT_phial_project_dix_cat:0 "Project D-IX"
STT_phial_project_dix_cat_desc:0 "Thanks to the vigorous and constant work of our top scientists, we have concocted a serum able to make any kind of equine into their own kind of super soldier! Maybe a pegasus wishes to fly at an even higher velocity? Maybe an earth pony wishes for its constitution to be increased? Or maybe the uptight unicorn desires a completely organized train of thought, so their focus can be as clear as the Stable's artificial lights. Whenever the situation changes, we may switch out the serums every now and then. But, we must proceed with caution, while we know the short-term effects are inaccurate to the serum's true nature, our unfortunate troopers do not realize this. And thus, if we continue the injections, they may start to dissent."

STT_phial_matrix_cat_desc:0 "Due to our natural instinct for war among our own is not the highest, we have resorted to other means to getting our way in this radiation filled, horrid wasteland. Robots. Experimenting with several types of robots have granted us an edge in that field, thus, it is purely reasonable that we use it to our advantage. We may either focus our resources on constructing a powerful, mainly defensive type. Or, we can settle for a type more suited towards in agile support class. Either way, we are far beyond our enemies in terms of robotics research."

STT_moudry_purple_revolution:0 "The Purple Revolutions"
STT_moudry_purple_revolution_desc:0 "With the rise of the Republicans, comes the rise of their ideology, all throughout the wastes. Primitive wastelanders who refuse to see the light of a brighter, better world, deserve a lesson taught to them through force. That's where we come in. We cannot aim to high, but our primitive neighbors, who don't posses much more power than us are plenty available for our agents. We get in, stir up some trouble among the populace and government, spread our message, and light the fire. All according to plan.\n\n\nWe have destabilized our target's population [Root.GetDestabPower].\n\nWe have spread rumours about our targets leader [Root.GetRumor].\n\nWe have decreased war support in our target [Root.GetMorale]."

STT_mass_division:0 "Divided Stable"
STT_mass_division_desc:0 "Our Stable has, ever since the start of its existence in the beginning of the Great War, been completely divided. Before the war began, two towns found refuge in the Stable, but at a price. They would both be completely separated from each other, and be taught radically different ideals. Now time can only tell what the fate of the Stable is.
