 cossacksfree.1.d:0 "As the meeting commenced, the air in the tent smelled like sweat, blood, and of course, the steppe itself.\n\nIn the war-tent stood Burning Steppe alongside two of her generals, completely caught up in a discussion about the next course of action. A small group of soldiers from each army waited outside the improvised command-centre; only those brave enough stood nearby to listen to the discussions inside.\n\n"This is difficult," Yesaul Free Spirit remarked. "We should already be out there, not sitting on our flanks." She had been leading this particular unit since before the start of hostilities began. Her voice carried through the heavy canvas walls separating her troops from the rest of the camp.\n\nStampede, the most recently arrived Yesaul, agreed. He leaned against the table, still towering over the other ponies in the room.\n\nFree Spirit's eyes darted around with precision, meeting each of the other attendants once, her stare determined, as if she could will Stampede and the lesser officers to partake in the discussion by eye-contact alone. The only other ponies that had talked so far were the the Hetpone, Burning Steppe herself, and a junior Officer called Vast Embrace. Everypony else remained silent except for the occasional grunt of nerve. It seemed nopony wanted to take responsibility for making such critical decisions, and Stampede would be happy to let her take the fall for any mistakes in the opening days of this war.\n\nFinally, giving up hope that somepony else might step forward and offer some advice, Free Spirit took the initiative again. With an annoyed look upon her face, she turned towards Stampede and asked if his Scouts had come back with numbers on Limua's forces yet. Stampede shook his head.\n\n"No. All we know is that these mages started operations in capturing our eastern outposts, mainly in Velika. Initial reports suggest they are making heavy use of Robots, and apparently even raising their own dead soldiers to fight again, if you can believe it. I'm afraid we're already losing ground.", ha added with a frown.\n\nWith that, Free Spirit sighed and closed her eyes. "We'll have to move quickly..."\n\nA few seconds of silence fell over the tension-filled tent. Finally, Burning Steppe stepped forward.\n\n"Indeed. It's time to strike back," she proudly declared. "I want all three armies ready to march within the hour!".
 cossacksfree.1.a:0 "To War!"
 
 cossacksfree.2.t:0 "The Hetpone's Speech"
 cossacksfree.2.d:0 "As soon as morning hit, the assembled Cossack host began moving out of their encampment and onto the plaza. In the distance, a single Pony could be seen trotting to the balcony. Adorned in an outfit that symbolized her status, this pony was none other than the highly respected Hetpone of Smoerbott, Burning Steppe. The entire combined host looked on in awe as the mare proudly stood on the balcony.\nBurning Steppe then raised her hoof high into the air. She saluted the assembled ponies and shouted out loud enough for everypony to hear.\n\n"COSSACKS!"\n\nBefore the Hetpone stood an enormous assembled army of ponies, all hailing from different hosts who had come together in the city square. Many of these ponies were former soldiers of the Northern Expeditionary Army, the images of the battles they fought still fresh on their minds. Many other soldiers were simply steppe commoners that had joined the hosts when they heard news of the newly formed state. These hosts were all joined by several  other Cossack families that hailed from outside the Commonwealth. All present were dressed in their finest armor, weapons, and equipment. Every pony wore a proud expression on their faces, and they all held their heads high.\nThe atmosphere was electric as the Cossacks could finally feel vindicated after years of waiting for when they would reclaim their rightful land.\n\n"For the first time in our history, we stand united as an independent nation!" Burning Steppe bellowed, "No longer must we serve the crown that has disrespected our name for far too long! For once, we can truly fight for ourselves!"\nThe sprawling army of Cossacks cheered in unison. After a moment, the cheering died down, and the gathered ponies began chanting.\n\n"HETPONE! HETPONE!"\n\nAfter a few minutes, the Cossack flag came flying through the open gate. An entirely new host followed suit, raising their banners high above them. Banners were handed to all the other units, which then proceeded to do the same. Soon, the entire area was filled with the flags of the various hosts. As one, they all roared out loud in victory and pride.\n\n"Now let's show the Commonwealth what true freedom looks like!" Burning Steppe then held up her own banner aloft for every Cossack to see, the banner of the Smoerbotti Freestate."
 cossacksfree.2.a:0 "A nation of our own."
 
 cossacksfree.3.t:0 "A new Enemy"
 cossacksfree.3.d:0 "Wild Chaser stood from the top of the lookout tower as he kept guard duty. He looked over the tower, scanning the horizon as far as he could see. Despite the peace however, his eyes began to narrow as he spotted something moving out there.\n\n"Hey, I think someone's coming," he alerted his guard partner, Steeldance. They both watched a rather large band of ponies expose themselves from behind cover. They were marching forward in a loose formation, each of them carrying no observable uniforms. Some carried rifles, while others wielded more traditional shotguns. Upon closer inspection, these weren't actually ponies but... ghouls. Their pace was also sluggish as if they weren't used to walking.\n\n"Ghouls!" Wild Chaser said aloud as he turned around and alarmed the entire outpost. Within seconds, the base was swarming with guards rushing outside of the main barracks.\n\n"How many?" A pony from below yelled, "Are they feral?"\n\n"Not as far as I know, mow them down before they get any closer!" Chaser replied.\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking, gunfire seemed to erupt from both sides of the battlefield. The sound of bullets zipping through the air echoed across the outpost. Many of the guards responded efficiently by unleashing a barrage of suppressive fire upon the exposed band of ghouls. Within seconds, the air was filled with smoke and dust. The ponies continued firing until the last ghoul had dropped dead.\n\n"That should be it." Steeldance sighed, "They're done for now..."\n\nYet, something didn't feel right. These ghouls went down too easily... Wild Chaser shook his head and raised a hoof into the air.\n\n"Wait!" Chaser shouted. "Look!"\n\nSteeldance quickly looked over to where the first wave of ghouls fell and noticed something that made him stop almost stop breathing entirely. Despite getting shot numerous times, none of them showed any signs of bleeding. Instead, they slowly began to rise back up to their hooves. As if they never even took a hit.\n\n"No way, I've heard about this..." Steeldance muttered.\n\nThe rest of the outpost kept firing, although a cold panic began to spread through each and all of the ponies.\n\n"Why are these shits not going down?" Wild Chaser blared, "Why are they rising again?!""

 cossacksfree.4.t:0 "The Siege of Limua"
 cossacksfree.4.d:0 "Solid Ground fished another Clip out of the Coat of Early Harvest. That would make 12 she had left now, hopefully enough to see her through this battle. From a few rooms over she could hear Harvest pleading with the medics, his voice being much more shrill than usual.\n\nThose damn necromancers had booby-trapped the corpses of their own fallen, and one such bomb had seared most of the Skin from Harvest's front legs.\nSolid ground re-focused, banishing the thoughts of her commanding officer lying on the ground in a mess of his own blood.\nThis was her time now, and as the new officer it was her duty to see the 17 ponies she was responsible for through this hell.\nThey were almost through the northern ward now, the Spires of the Council's Academy well within their sight. The mages seemed to think that they could still win this war, throwing more and more monsters, traps and conscripts at them.\nAs she made her way trough the factory, staying out of sight of any windows, she tried to recall what the briefing said about the last push to the Academy:\nApparently, their advance force had been engaged by some sort of beast made out of animated Razorwire, big as a truck. Their unit had been wiped out, and the Plaza where it was encountered was thoroughly shelled.\nShe really hoped that was the only of these things the mages had.\n\nWith a deep breath, she calmed herself, and approached her new command."
 cossacksfree.4.a:0 "Magic shatteres against Cossack Might!"
 
 cossacksfree.5.t:0 "Peace at Last"
 cossacksfree.5.d:0 "The guns finally fell silent.\n\nBurning Steppe had barely noticed it over the ringing in her ears, having grown all too accustomed to the constant roar of explosions, the thunderous-staccato of machineguns and the occasional high whistling of magical munitions.\nAt last, its was done.\nAround her, and all over the battlefield her soldiers came to the same realization, many shouting and whooping, while others simply sat down from exhaustion.\nThe last enemy army had been beaten, their final strongholds taken by Cossack might and bravery.\nAnd sacrifice, oh so much sacrifice.\nHer ponies had bled for this victory, and all those that came before it, but at least they had not died in vain. With this thought, a realization hit Burning Steppe:\nFor all this bloodshed, all these cries for independence to mean anything in ages to come, she would have to lay down her sword and forge these disparate territories into a coherent nation...\nWhat use was freedom if her people starved, or the Yaks simply swept them up a few years down the line?\n\nBurning Steppe returned to camp, congratulated her officers, and gave the order to give out the last of their alcohol-supplies. As the Soldiers and officers celebrated, she pulled out the many maps and reports that had accumulated in her wartent over the course of the campaign, and she began drafting an outline, a plan for how she could keep up this unity among her people, even without an enemy to fight.\n\nThis would be a long Night."
 cossacksfree.5.a:0 "Victory is only the first step."
 
 cossacksfree.6.t:0 "A new Way of Life"
 cossacksfree.6.d:0 "With the war finally over, many Cossack families had already begun to adjust to their new life of serving nopony but themselves. While the majority still lived off the land, many towns within Cossack autonomy had slowly begun to embrace a level of autonomy not previously found under the Commonwealth. Many non-Cossack families had also began to grow accustomed to living alongside their new nomadic neighbors. This did lead to many issues, however. Most notably, many of these families didn't understand the culture or customs that drove the Cossacks. A large number of ponies also resented being forced to live by these new standards, and obey a regime that may as well be foreign. Others, though, saw the benefits of having their own land and chose to stay put rather than relocate elsewhere.\n\nRegardless, the real rule that had begun to spread was that whatever or whomever you fought for, you fight with a ferocity that was unmatched throughout the wastes. It wasn't uncommon for a group of Cossacks to gather at the local tavern to share stories about their adventures and lives in the Severnayan Wasteland. A good story was worth its weight in gold, especially if it happened to be true.\n\nNow serving nopony else but the Hetpone, the Cossacks were free to make any decisions that they saw fit. And because most of them didn't need much to survive on their own,  many towns tended to get along quite well. Sure, many might have disagreements, but in time they would grow to be happy with their new way of life.\n\nAnd above all, they knew that their homeland was safe, because what these ponies knew best was fighting for the steppes they have called home for so long."

 cossacksfree.10.d:0 "The Future of the Cossacks, and the Commonwealth in general had hung in the balance for these last few months.\nBut, while the Izbawi and Hetponatists quarrelled and threatened, they never managed to properly threaten the Government.\nBurning Steppe has managed to play her enemies against eachother, and keept control of the military.\nDespite unhappiness from both opposition-parties, neither dared move against the mare that so expertly untangled their plans.\n\nBurning Steppe herself announced the re-formation of the Commonwealth today.\nThis time it won't be a nation governed by a monarch, but by a Hetpone, and the members of the Rada.\nDespite calls by fringe-elements for the Hetpone to become an elected position, Burning Steppe dismissed the notion as an idea for more stable and peaceful times.\nThe end of our Problems might not be here yet, but the Commonwealth is on a path to become a prosperous and unified Nation once more!"

 cossacksfree.11.d:0 "The stiff expression dropped from Free Spirit's face, as soon as she was sure that none of Burning Steppe's staff was watching her.\nIn its place a smile crept across her face, as she could hardly belive it:\nBurning Steppe had offered to step down as Hetpone and name Free Spirit as her chosen successor.\nSteppe had recognized Spirit's popularity, and the massive influence her Izbawi now held in the Rada.\nAs she left the building, Free Spirit waved down one of her Adjutants, who was carrying a two-way Radio.\nShe began calling her supporters in the Rada and the Army, as preparations would need to be made to fully checkmate Stampede, and dissuade him from some foolish attempt at a coup.\n\nAs morning dawned, the police had disarmed the Hetponatist, as Stampede had given his supporters the order not to resist.\nSurrounded by her Guards that shielded her from the cheering ponies, Free Spirit ascended the stairs to the Rada, where she turned to the masses, took of her Sash of office and began a speech she had long been waiting for:"

 cossacksfree.16.d:0 "The crackling of Rifle-fire filled the Streets of Smoerbott, only occasionally interrupted by Sirens or a large explosion.\nVast Embrace and his advisors were huddled around the table with a multitude of maps strewn across it. Some for the City itself, but most for Buildings: The Garrison, Stampede's estate, the Guard-station and even the Rada itself.\n§pNever thought I'd fight in not one but TWO revolutions in my life§! Crystal Drop remarked, as she was drawing plans of entry for the Rada.\nThe former Protegé of the late Vermillion Grace had joined their party only a few months ago, and already proven herself supremely capable.\nAs Vast embrace looked across the room he saw ponies who not two years ago would have killed eachother on sight. Former Royal guards planning together with Commandos of the Vermillion Army. Lady Ingenue was having a heated discussion with Purple Lightning, while Dampffeder was drawing up plans with Aegis to seize the industrial District.\nVast Embrace couldn't help but smile.\nThis is what the first revolution should have been: not a hunt to exterminate your enemies, but a force that brought ponies together. The extremists of the loosing sides had all perished with their armies, fled the country or had been hunted down by the Voysko Prykhova. Now, all that remained were those willing to compromise.\nAnd together, they would stop Stampede, and Free Spirit, and even burning Steppe, who were threatening to plunge the nation into a second civil war.\nTogether, they would bring actual peace, and real democracy to the Commonwealth.\nVast Embrace checked his revolver once more, before ordering everyone to their squads.\n\nIt was time to put an end to madness."
