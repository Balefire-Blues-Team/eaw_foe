He knew this curiosity came from what he was, §rMother§! had explained it to him.\nHe was a *Cerastes Strain* designated scout and infiltrator, naturally curious and small in stature, to aid in his purpose.\nHe chanced a look out of a broken window, and saw the group of Ponies... Collaborators §rMother§! had called them, scurrying towards a flat, squat building.\nThey seemed afraid, spooked by their previous encounter with two *Eurytus Strain* who had already killed four members of this group.\nHe fell into the position to jump, watching carefully...There!\nJust as half the group had entered the building, the rest of his Squad ambushed them, he himself jumping from his window, landing on the back of one of the Collaborators. Something within the pony snapped with a sickening CRUNCH, and they... she, it was a mare, went limp. The rest of the Collaborators had not fared better, being naught but corpses strewn across the floor in the few seconds the ambush lasted."
