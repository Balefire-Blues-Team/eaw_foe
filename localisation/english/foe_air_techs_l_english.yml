balloon_tech:0 "Balloon"
balloon_tech_desc:0 "Airships have existed in the world in one form or another for millennia. From the early wooden-hulled Cloud Trimee of early Pegasus culture to the swift hulls and hardy balloons of the Griffonian Empire.\nIt is no surprise then to find airships among the clouded skies of the Wasteland. Corvettes are small, sometimes comparable in size to large fishing boats, or sloops of the Pre-War era. Regardless of make, quality, or armament, these craft are generally simple, cheaply produced, and easy to maintain compared to conventional aircraft. Skyships of this class are among the most common sighted in service to the factions of the Post-War Wasteland."

blimp_airframe_0_desc:0 "Airships have existed in the world in one form or another for millennia.

Skyships of this class are among the most common sighted in service to the factions of the Post-War Wasteland."

blimp_airframe_1:0 "Cruising Airship"
blimp_airframe_1_desc:0 "Where the basic airship mainly focused on simplicity and ease of production, the Cruising Airship is normally the sight most associated with military powers. Better armored and armed than any low-tech wasteland craft, Airships of this class are the general workhorses of any dirigible airfleet.\nThis greater scale and combat-ability comes at a cost, as the complexity of the craft grows, its reliability and speed suffers, not to mention the significantly higher production costs."

blimp_airframe_2:0 "Zeppelin"
blimp_airframe_2_desc:0 "The Star of any airfleets Ground-attack Corps, airships of the Zeppelin classification sacrifice the adaptability of the Cruising-ship for size, armor, and additional combat capability. Able to devastate enemy ground forces with dedicated military-grade batteries of cannons and lasers, and defend itself against conventional aircraft or rivals in its class.\nZeppelins are the bread and butter of an advanced nations airfleet, able to take on most threats in the Sky."

blimp_airframe_3:0 "Aerofortress"
blimp_airframe_3_desc:0 "Like the wet navies of the Old world, and the grand Airfleets of the wartime superpowers, the question of where to stop building is a difficult one. Aerofortress class hulls consist of some of the heaviest armored, armed, and equipped craft since the unveiling of the tremendously rare Thunderhead-class of Old Equestria.\nFew Wasteland nations are able to field such Airships in significant numbers, but those that do are best treated with caution. Few things can reliably best a well-built Aerofortress, but the most common are time, hubris, and another of its Kind."

helicopter_airframe_4:0 "Anti-Gravity Drone"
helicopter_airframe_4_desc:0 "The 'GiuBLfz 32', or Unmanned Anti-Gravity Airframe was a newcomer to the airplane scene in the late war, developed by the Hive-Federation in Vraks. Due to their removal from the Great War, the Changelings went on a completely different technological route, focusing on lightweight drone-aircraft rather than the Sky-dominating behemoths of Equestria. Speed was traded for superior agility and dogfighting firepower, with no pilot holding back what G-forces the vehicle could endure."


telepuls_engine:0 "Telekinetic-Impulse Matrix"
telepuls_engine_desc:0 "This Cutting-edge technology replaces regular engines with two localized spell-matrices, emulating the telekinetic powers inherent to all unicorns. While an individual matrix can't lift itself, only things outside it's casing, with two matrices, they can alternatingly lift, or propel each other and the rest of the plane. To prevent either matrix being ripped from the fuselage by the imparting of additional momentum, this alternating propulsion occurs between 1700-2500 time a second, feeling like a single, smooth motion to the pilot and observers."

zebra_stealth_field:0 "Isithun Stealth-Field"
zebra_stealth_field_desc:0 "An upgraded and upscaled version of the prevalent Zebrican stealth-talismans. This System provides both optical, as well as magical camouflage, though it diminishes in effectiveness when the enemy is within 1-2Km. Fortunately for Zebrican pilots, at that point it will often already be too late for the enemy, and they can release their payloads and disengage."
