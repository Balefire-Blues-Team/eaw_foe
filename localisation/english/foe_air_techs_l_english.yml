 robot_simple_ai_tech:0 "Simple AI"
 robot_simple_ai_tech_desc:0 "In the early days of the Great War, the Zebrican Empire adopted the practice of binding nature spirits to their equipment. So long as the spirits were compliant, this method could result in self-operating weaponry. As a counter to this, the recently established Equestrian Ministry of Wartime Technology worked alongside the Ministry of Arcane Sciences worked to develop complex spell-matrixes that could simulate the same effect. Though these matrixes saw limited usage by the Equestrian army, they would go on to be crucial in the development of early computing technology."
 
 
 ###Equipment###
 
 light_robot_clock_equipment:0 "Clockwork Automata"
 light_robot_clock_equipment_desc:0 "The Clockwork Automata were the first major self-thinking machines used within warfare. Rather than being invented by either Equestria or Zebrica, they were instead invented by the infamous griffon engineer Leopold Schmeller. Their first usage was in the brief Barrad-Wittenland War, where they formed the bulk of the Barrad forces. Zebrica would go on to copy the design and use their own automata in the earliest battles of the War."
