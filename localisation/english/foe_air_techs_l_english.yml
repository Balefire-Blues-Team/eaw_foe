helicopter_airframe_4:0 "Anti-Gravity Drone"
helicopter_airframe_4_desc:0 "The 'GiuBLfz 32', or Unmanned Anti-Gravity Airframe was a newcomer to the airplane scene in the late war, developed by the Hive-Federation in Vraks. Due to their removal from the Great War, the Changelings went on a completely different technological route, focusing on lightweight drone-aircraft rather than the Sky-dominating behemoths of Equestria. Speed was traded for superior agility and dogfighting firepower, with no pilot holding back what G-forces the vehicle could endure."


telepuls_engine:0 "Telekinetic-Impulse Matrix"
telepuls_engine_desc:0 "This Cutting-edge technology replaces regular engines with two localized spell-matrices, emulating the telekinetic powers inherent to all unicorns. While an individual matrix can't lift itself, only things outside it's casing, with two matrices, they can alternatingly lift, or propel each other and the rest of the plane. To prevent either matrix being ripped from the fuselage by the imparting of additional momentum, this alternating propulsion occurs between 1700-2500 time a second, feeling like a single, smooth motion to the pilot and observers."

zebra_stealth_field:0 "Isithun Stealth-Field"
zebra_stealth_field_desc:0 "An upgraded and upscaled version of the prevalent Zebrican stealth-talismans. This System provides both optical, as well as magical camouflage, though it diminishes in effectiveness when the enemy is within 1-2Km. Fortunately for Zebrican pilots, at that point it will often already be too late for the enemy, and they can release their payloads and disengage."
