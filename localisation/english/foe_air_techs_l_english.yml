balloon_tech:0 "Balloon"
balloon_tech_desc:0 "Airships have existed in the world in one form or another for millennia. From the early wooden-hulled Cloud Trimee of early Pegasus culture to the swift hulls and hardy balloons of the Griffonian Empire.\nIt is no surprise then to find airships among the clouded skies of the Wasteland. Corvettes are small, sometimes comparable in size to large fishing boats, or sloops of the Pre-War era. Regardless of make, quality, or armament, these craft are generally simple, cheaply produced, and easy to maintain compared to conventional aircraft. Skyships of this class are among the most common sighted in service to the factions of the Post-War Wasteland."

blimp_airframe_0_desc:0 "Airships have existed in the world in one form or another for millennia. From the early wooden-hulled Cloud-carriages of early Pegasus culture to the swift hulls and hardy balloons of the Griffonian Empire.\nIt is no surprise then to find airships among the clouded skies of the Wasteland.

blimp_airframe_1:0 "Cruising Airship"
blimp_airframe_1_desc:0 "Where the basic airship mainly focused on simplicity and ease of production, the Cruising Airship is normally the sight most associated with military powers. Better armored and armed than any low-tech wasteland craft, Airships of this class are the general workhorses of any dirigible airforce.\nThis greater scale and combat-ability comes at a cost, as the complexity of the craft grows, its reliability and speed suffers, not to mention the significantly higher production costs."

blimp_airframe_2:0 "Zeppelin"
blimp_airframe_2_desc:0 "The Star of any Airforces Ground-attack Corps, airships of the Zeppelin classification sacrifice the adaptability of the Cruising-ship for size, armor, and additional combat capability. Able to devastate enemy ground forces with dedicated military-grade batteries of cannons and lasers, and defend itself against conventional aircraft or rivals in its class.\nZeppelins are the bread and butter of an advanced nations Airforce, able to take on most threats in the Sky."

blimp_airframe_3:0 "Aerofortress"
blimp_airframe_3_desc:0 "Like the wet navies of the Old world, and the grand Airfleets of the wartime superpowers, the question of where to stop building is a difficult one. Aerofortress class hulls consist of some of the heaviest armored, armed, and equipped craft since the unveiling of the tremendously rare Thunderhead-class of Old Equestria.\nFew Wasteland nations are able to field such Airships in significant numbers, but those that do are best treated with caution. Few things can reliably best a well-built Aerofortress, but the most common are time, hubris, and another of its Kind."

helicopter_airframe_4:0 "Anti-Gravity Drone"
helicopter_airframe_4_desc:0 "The 'GiuBLfz 32', or Unmanned Anti-Gravity Airframe was a newcomer to the airplane scene in the late war, developed by the Hive-Federation in Vraks. Due to their removal from the Great War, the Changelings went on a completely different technological route, focusing on lightweight drone-aircraft rather than the Sky-dominating behemoths of Equestria. Speed was traded for superior agility and dogfighting firepower, with no pilot holding back what G-forces the vehicle could endure."


telepuls_engine:0 "Telekinetic-Impulse Matrix"
telepuls_engine_desc:0 "This Cutting-edge technology replaces regular engines with two localized spell-matrices, emulating the telekinetic powers inherent to all unicorns. While an individual matrix can't lift itself, only things outside it's casing, with two matrices, they can alternatingly lift, or propel each other and the rest of the plane. To prevent either matrix being ripped from the fuselage by the imparting of additional momentum, this alternating propulsion occurs between 1700-2500 time a second, feeling like a single, smooth motion to the pilot and observers."

zebra_stealth_field:0 "Isithun Stealth-Field"
zebra_stealth_field_desc:0 "An upgraded and upscaled version of the prevalent Zebrican stealth-talismans. This System provides both optical, as well as magical camouflage, though it diminishes in effectiveness when the enemy is within 1-2Km. Fortunately for Zebrican pilots, at that point it will often already be too late for the enemy, and they can release their payloads and disengage."

dragonlance:0 "Dragonlance"
dragonlance_desc:0 "The only weapon ever developed to reliably pierce the scales of Elder Dragons at a reasonable range. This enourmous array of Plasma-Emitters and particle-accelerators runs the entire length of a Raptor-Class Cloudship and is usually their main armament. While we are unlikely to fight Elder Dragons anytime soon, a blast from the Dragonlance can just as easily vaporize aircraft or glass whole formations of Ground-troops."

magical_float_engine_desc:0 "The Fabulously Ludicrously Obscenely Awesome Telekinetic Engine was a joint development of the Ministries of Awesome and Image. As the MoA required a new upscaled type of float-talisman for their ever greater Airships, the MoI volunteered the expertise of their Reverse-engineering division, which had already been working on adapting Zebra-talismans on a never before seen scale. The F.L.O.A.T. Engine was the fruitful result of this cooperation."

agrav_angle_engine:0 "Agrav-Angle Engine"
agrav_angle_engine_desc:0 "In their efforts to explore alternate paths of Aircraft-development, the Changelings developed a custom-made engine, specifically for the GiuBLfz 32. A hideously complex array of movement-vector talismans makes this engine capable of not only mimicing telekinetic flight, but actually exceeding some of it's capabilities. While the Agrav-Angle is significantly slower, it was designed to be mass-produced, and requires little to no rare components. Additionally, due to the different talismans feeding off each others waste-heat the engine can function in near-perpetual motion, only requiring a miniscule amount of energy to be fed from the outside, making it exceptionally compact."
