balloon_tech:0 "Balloon"
balloon_tech_desc:0 "Airships have existed in the world in one form or another for millennia. From the early wooden-hulled Cloud Trimee of early Pegasus culture to the swift hulls and hardy balloons of the Griffonian Empire.\nIt is no surprise then to find airships among the clouded skies of the Wasteland. Corvettes are small, sometimes comparable in size to large fishing boats, or sloops of the Pre-War era. Regardless of make, quality, or armament, these craft are generally simple, cheaply produced, and easy to maintain compared to conventional aircraft. Skyships of this class are among the most common sighted in service to the factions of the Post-War Wasteland."

blimp_airframe_0_desc:0 "Airships have existed in the world in one form or another for millennia. From the early wooden-hulled Cloud-carriages of early Pegasus culture to the swift hulls and hardy balloons of the Griffonian Empire.\nIt is no surprise then to find airships among the clouded skies of the Wasteland. Regardless of make, quality, or armament, these craft are generally simple, cheaply produced, and easy to maintain. Skyships of this class are among the most common sighted in service to the factions of the Post-War Wasteland."

blimp_airframe_1:0 "Cruising Airship"
blimp_airframe_1_desc:0 "Where the basic airship mainly focused on simplicity and ease of production, the Cruising Airship is normally the sight most associated with military powers. Better armored and armed than any low-tech wasteland craft, Airships of this class are the general workhorses of any dirigible airforce.\nThis greater scale and combat-ability comes at a cost, as the complexity of the craft grows, its reliability and speed suffers, not to mention the significantly higher production costs."

blimp_airframe_2:0 "Zeppelin"
blimp_airframe_2_desc:0 "The Star of any Airforces Ground-attack Corps, airships of the Zeppelin classification sacrifice the adaptability of the Cruising-ship for size, armor, and additional combat capability. Able to devastate enemy ground forces with dedicated military-grade batteries of cannons and lasers, and defend itself against conventional aircraft or rivals in its class.\nZeppelins are the bread and butter of an advanced nations Airforce, able to take on most threats in the Sky."

blimp_airframe_3:0 "Aerofortress"
blimp_airframe_3_desc:0 "Like the wet navies of the Old world, and the grand Airfleets of the wartime superpowers, the question of where to stop building is a difficult one. Aerofortress class hulls consist of some of the heaviest armored, armed, and equipped craft since the unveiling of the tremendously rare Thunderhead-class of Old Equestria.\nFew Wasteland nations are able to field such Airships in significant numbers, but those that do are best treated with caution. Few things can reliably best a well-built Aerofortress, but the most common are time, hubris, and another of its Kind."

light_plane_airframe_0:0 "Improvised Biplane"
light_plane_airframe_0_desc:0 "Considered the first kind of motorized flying-machine, Biplanes truly opened up the sky to the bold non-pegasus Flyers!"

light_plane_airframe_1:0 "Light Metal Airframe"
light_plane_airframe_1_desc:0 "With the advent of lightweight metal capable of supporting more weight, our biplane design becomes outdated. Speed and low drag is primordial, so a monoplane design is now preferable. Increased weight capacity allows the installation of a third, higher caliber machinegun for gun runs, switching to air cooling for our weaponry, as well as external struts able to support two 50kg high explosive bombs. Specially designed chemical engines for aeronautical purposes allows much higher top speed and better efficiency, giving us the possibility for increased strike range, better sortie rate and interception techniques against enemy crafts."

light_plane_airframe_2:0 "Light Composite Airframe"
light_plane_airframe_2_desc:0 "Until now, materials used in the construction of our planes were mostly wood and metal, but as a need for more tonnage capacity and stiffer construction begins, this will not be enough. What is needed is a light alloy both sturdy and cheap, able to withstand high-G manoeuvers. Experiments with alloy smelting should provide us with such a material, and let us go one step further into conquering the airspace."

light_plane_airframe_3:0 "Light Modern Airframe"
light_plane_airframe_3_desc:0 "Designing our fighters around an experimental jet engine instead of trying to fit said engine in an existing design allows maximum usage of every bit of power available while improving most, if not all flight characteristics. Incorporating pilot feedback from previous sorties as well as considering their demands will let us improve upon our engineering beyond what simple theory could give us. Internal bomb bays with provisions for 250kg bombs as well as fuselage-integrated, high-caliber, electrically-fired machineguns let us shred enemy fighters. It is essential to concentrate on higher rate of fire instead of firepower for our interceptors, as the window of opportunity on interception attempts get smaller and smaller because of the increased speed in engagements. Air-to-air multipurpose rockets on external wing-tip pylons finalises our improvements."

light_plane_airframe_4:0 "Arcanomechanical Airframe"
light_plane_airframe_4_desc:0 "An Arcane core instead of our more standard chemical engines let us lighten our fighters, as we can remove fuel tanks and switch them for more ammunition or avionics. The inclusion of nose radars, rotary autocannons and guided infrared air-to-air missiles massively increases our interception capabilities, letting us destroy anything but the most advanced enemy fighter in a single pass. A mixed ammunition belt, external bomb pylons and integrated ground scanner also increases our ground support ability. Our fighters are the most advanced in the entirety of the wasteland, and we dominate the airspace. No one is safe, be it enemy fighters or ground troops. Our missiles will clear the sky and our light thermobaric bombs will cleanse the battlefield."

light_plane_airframe_5:0 "Zebra Stealth-Airframe"
light_plane_airframe_5_desc:0 "This miracle of Zebrican technology c}M &?FASD'€#fa2!((%öqats&vn--aQoi_,,ZdAtu\n§R[REDACTED]§!"

large_plane_airframe_1:0 "Heavy Metal Airframe"
large_plane_airframe_1_desc:0 "As the need to hit the enemy directly in their land increases, new designs come from ingenuity. We need to be smart when it comes to conflict, strike both at their troops and war machine. Destroying infrastructures and military factories require good range and bomb payload as well as some defensive capabilities from enemy fighters. As such, a monoplace design reinforced by struts and with four engines in a double-line tandem configuration let us create a sturdy bomber design able to carry an impressive payload of upward of fifty-two 50kg bombs in a large internal bomb bay, as well as three machineguns in armored turrets. This configuration allows large autonomy in enemy territory, both in terms of ammo and fuel, as well as defensive capabilities. It is time to strike their homeland."

large_plane_airframe_2:0 "Heavy Composite Airframe"
large_plane_airframe_2_desc:0 "A four-engined, conventional monoplane design around a large fuselage forms our new bomber design. High-powered turboprop engines allow more armament to be carried, and this is put to good use. With defensive armaments increased to heavy machineguns and sometime even autocannons, aimed via gun-laying radars, along with bomb bays able to carry a variety of ordonnance upward of 1 ton, this bomber design can raze entire factories to the ground a single mighty high-altitude attack runs. Bigger fuel tanks let them strike even enemy capitals from our territories, and high-altitude tactics let them bypass most enemy interceptors and AA fire. The final improvement is a complement of flak jackets and helmets given to the crew to protect them against bullets, as well as steel plating protecting critical part of the planes such as gunner turrets, pilot compartment and bomb bay."

large_plane_airframe_3:0 "Heavy Modern Airframe"
large_plane_airframe_3_desc:0 "Jet engines allow for lighter and faster bomber designs, letting them strike their target and come back home safely in record time, sometime before they are even spotted. More sophisticated bomb loads such as fuel-air weaponry, guided glider bombs and hardened bunker penetrators, combined with terrain scanning search radars for accurate bomb runs even in plain darkness, increases their strategical capabilities. Advanced avionics such as pulsed Doppler radars to detect air threats and an astro-inertia navigation system let our bomber formations find the fastest way to and from their target, while a multitude of those informations linked to a rear-facing rotary autocannon provide good defenses even against advanced fighter designs."

blimp_airframe_4:0 "Raptor Cloudship"
blimp_airframe_4_desc:0 "The Pinnacle of Cloudship design, Raptors truly rule the Skies!"

helicopter_airframe_5:0 "Skytank"
helicopter_airframe_5_desc:0 "Thanks to Cloudlift-technology, Skytanks are just that, massive armoured hulks with as many guns as the reactor can power strapped to them. While somewhat slow, they can stay in the air almost indefinitely, needing neither reloading nor refueling."

helicopter_airframe_1:0 "Scrap Helicopter"
helicopter_airframe_1_desc:0 "Using more primitive, and easy to acquire components, we can still build earlier designs of the Equestrian Helicopters."

helicopter_airframe_2:0 "Composite Helicopter"
helicopter_airframe_2_desc:0 "These fearsome machines of War were first employed by the Zebra Empire in the offensive of 1024, sweeping over the Southeastern jungles and raining death upon equestrian troops and their thestral allies."

helicopter_airframe_3:0 "Vertibuck"
helicopter_airframe_3_desc:0 "The signature Air-assault vehicle of the Late war, variants of the Vertibuck were employed by first Equestria, and quickly thereafter the Zebra empire as well, due to successful espionage. It's V-tol capabilities made it faster and than all of its contemporaries, and its heavy armour protected from all but dedicated AA-weapons."

helicopter_airframe_4:0 "Anti-Gravity Drone"
helicopter_airframe_4_desc:0 "The 'GiuBLfz 32', or Unmanned Anti-Gravity Airframe was a newcomer to the airplane scene in the late war, developed by the Hive-Federation in Vraks. Due to their removal from the Great War, the Changelings went on a completely different technological route, focusing on lightweight drone-aircraft rather than the Sky-dominating behemoths of Equestria. Speed was traded for superior agility and dogfighting firepower, with no pilot holding back what G-forces the vehicle could endure."


telepuls_engine:0 "Telekinetic-Impulse Matrix"
telepuls_engine_desc:0 "This Cutting-edge technology replaces regular engines with two localized spell-matrices, emulating the telekinetic powers inherent to all unicorns. While an individual matrix can't lift itself, only things outside it's casing, with two matrices, they can alternatingly lift, or propel each other and the rest of the plane. To prevent either matrix being ripped from the fuselage by the imparting of additional momentum, this alternating propulsion occurs between 1700-2500 time a second, feeling like a single, smooth motion to the pilot and observers."

zebra_stealth_field:0 "Isithun Stealth-Field"
zebra_stealth_field_desc:0 "An upgraded and upscaled version of the prevalent Zebrican stealth-talismans. This System provides both optical, as well as magical camouflage, though it diminishes in effectiveness when the enemy is within 1-2Km. Fortunately for Zebrican pilots, at that point it will often already be too late for the enemy, and they can release their payloads and disengage."

dragonlance:0 "Dragonlance"
dragonlance_desc:0 "The only weapon ever developed to reliably pierce the scales of Elder Dragons at a reasonable range. This enourmous array of Plasma-Emitters and particle-accelerators runs the entire length of a Raptor-Class Cloudship and is usually their main armament. While we are unlikely to fight Elder Dragons anytime soon, a blast from the Dragonlance can just as easily vaporize aircraft or glass whole formations of Ground-troops."

magical_float_engine_desc:0 "The Fabulously Ludicrously Obscenely Awesome Telekinetic Engine was a joint development of the Ministries of Awesome and Image. As the MoA required a new upscaled type of float-talisman for their ever greater Airships, the MoI volunteered the expertise of their Reverse-engineering division, which had already been working on adapting Zebra-talismans on a never before seen scale. The F.L.O.A.T. Engine was the fruitful result of this cooperation."

agrav_angle_engine:0 "Agrav-Angle Engine"
agrav_angle_engine_desc:0 "In their efforts to explore alternate paths of Aircraft-development, the Changelings developed a custom-made engine, specifically for the GiuBLfz 32. A hideously complex array of movement-vector talismans makes this engine capable of not only mimicing telekinetic flight, but actually exceeding some of it's capabilities. While the Agrav-Angle is significantly slower, it was designed to be mass-produced, and requires little to no rare components. Additionally, due to the different talismans feeding off each others waste-heat the engine can function in near-perpetual motion, only requiring a miniscule amount of energy to be fed from the outside, making it exceptionally compact."
