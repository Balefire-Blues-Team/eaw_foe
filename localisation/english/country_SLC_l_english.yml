 SLC_char_starlight_council_name:0 "Starlight Council"
 SLC_char_starlight_council_desc:0 "The §tStarlight Council§! is a truly enigmatic entity in the wasteland.\nThey have united a disparate alliance of raiders and tribals in what can only be called a §OTechno-Cult§!. Nocreature is truly sure where the council came from, or who founded it, but anyone who has interacted with one of the Council's agents knows that they have an awful lot of knowledge about wartime technology and the more §tesoteric magics§! that Equestria employed in the last years of the war.\n\nTheir main facilities seem to be located in a series of §Runderground Bunkers§! all over the Starlight Cabal's territory, though neither outsider, nor even their own Raider-cultists is allowed inside, unless they have been chosen to §tascend and become a member of the Council§!."
