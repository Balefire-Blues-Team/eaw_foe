 alicorns_desc:0 "Being the servants and children of the self-titled Goddess, the incredibly powerful alicorns are considered a rapidly rising force in the Equestrian Wasteland. Their combat potential exceeds anything short of a Steel Ranger; their magic is stronger than almost anypony else's, and their minds are connected within a magical hive-mind to ensure the highest efficiency possible. They are rightfully seen as one of the biggest threats in the wastes."
 tech_alicorns:0 "Alicorn Division"
 tech_alicorns_desc:0 "Artificial alicorns are the ultimate beings. Their immense arcane power and flight capabilities make them extremely effective in combat against almost every possible foe."
 tech_alicorns2:0 "Alicorn Division II"
 tech_alicorns2_desc:0 "Our alicorns natural mental link with one another can be used to enhance their combat potential. Increased communication between our alicorns will allow them to both organize and push an offence much more efficiently."
 tech_alicorns3:0 "Alicorn Division III"
 tech_alicorns3_desc:0 "Making sure that all of our alicorns have knowledge of basic tactics can help improve their combat performance substantially."
 tech_alicorns4:0 "Alicorn Division IV"
 tech_alicorns4_desc:0 "By ensuring that our alicorns are cautious and don't underestimate their enemies, we are also ensuring that they are less likely to be caught by surprise."
 tech_alicorns5:0 "Alicorn Division V"
 tech_alicorns5_desc:0 "Reflexes can be trained. By ensuring that our alicorns are capable of responding almost instantly to any hazard, we can further improve their combat capabilities."
 tech_alicorns6:0 "Alicorn Division VI"
 tech_alicorns6_desc:0 "Imparting knowledge of more advanced tactics to our alicorns can further improve their combat potential."

 tech_alicorn_spec:0 "Shared Memories"
 tech_alicorn_spec_desc:0 "We all share in one Unity of the mind. The mistakes of one alicorn may be learned from, and those lessons may be shared with all others."

 tech_alicorn_blue:0 "Enhanced Invisibility"
 tech_alicorn_blue_desc:0 "Our invisibility isn't perfect. We still make noise and there is still a faintly visible shift as We move. These flaws can be eliminated, though this will require We focus much of Our efforts on the blue alicorns."
 tech_alicorn_blue2:0 "Infiltration Focus"
 tech_alicorn_blue2_desc:0 "We can use Our talents to slip behind enemy lines and strike our foes flanks. However, less alicorns will be available for frontal assaults."
 tech_alicorn_blue3:0 "Invisible Reconnaissance"
 tech_alicorn_blue3_desc:0 "Our invisibility makes Us into natural scouts. The only downside is that fewer alicorns will be available for battle."
 tech_alicorn_blue4:0 "Patient Alicorns"
 tech_alicorn_blue4_desc:0 "We can wait for a very long time. Our alicorns may lie in wait, setting ambushes far in advance or holding scouting positions for a long time. Unfortunateky, this will take even more alicorns away from the front lines."

 tech_alicorn_green:0 "Enhanced Shields"
 tech_alicorn_green_desc:0 "Our shields are capable of providing immense protection to Our children. Further enhancing them will prevent avoidable casualties, but focusing so heavily on them will prevent us from improving the other alicorn subtypes."
 tech_alicorn_green2:0 "Defensive Coordination"
 tech_alicorn_green2_desc:0 "All of Our alicorns must be trained in maintaining defensive formations. Though these formations may not be as effective at blitzing through enemy lines, they more than make up for it by protecting Our children."
 tech_alicorn_green3:0 "Telepathic Organizers"
 tech_alicorn_green3_desc:0 "Taking time to telepathically plan and coordinate every move might make Our alicorns slower to respond in combat, but it will greatly enhance their overall cohesion."
 tech_alicorn_green4:0 "Master Telepaths"
 tech_alicorn_green4_desc:0 "We have perfected Our art of telepathy. Our alicorns are capable of sending their thoughts directly to eachother with but a moments delay. Every enemy movement may now be reported to every other alicorn the moment it happens, though this has led to Our children being even more cautious in their advances."

 tech_alicorn_purple:0 "Enhanced Teleportation"
 tech_alicorn_purple_desc:0 "Rapid teleportation can allow Our alicorns to move across large distances at faster speeds than they otherwise would be capable of. However, this is not perfect, as it will throw Our children into disarray. Furthermore, focusing on providing this ability to as many of Our children as possible will require us to focus much more heavily on purple alicorns."
 tech_alicorn_purple2:0 "Power Blasts"
 tech_alicorn_purple2_desc:0 "A blast of pure arcane energy is more than enough to throw back enemy forces or to crush armored foes. By relying on this application of intense power, We can increase Our combat effectiveness substantially."
 tech_alicorn_purple3:0 "Chain Lightning Spell"
 tech_alicorn_purple3_desc:0 "Lightning is a powerful force that may be used to great effect in combat, especially if We can make it arc from foe to foe. Unfortunately, this comes with a downside of forcing Our own alicorns to remain at a greater distance of one another, lest they get caught in the attack as well."
 tech_alicorn_purple4:0 "Endless Assault"
 tech_alicorn_purple4_desc:0 "We are capable of fighting for much longer than Our foes. A relentless assault will wear down defences and tire infantry, until eventually our enemies lines break."
