NAC_proud_reserve_1_idea_desc:0 "The §OReserve§!, mainly Ghouls hailing from the time of the great war, present the majority of our military might. Most of them were members of the §CCivil Defence Force§!, a paramilitary arm of the Equestrian government, that were called up in the last days of the great war.\nThe §OReserve§! is supremely disciplined, and expert when it comes to tunnel-fighting, but is also heavily opposed to reforming our army, and their strict standards prevent a proper mobilization."

command.1.t:0 "Back into the Sun"
command.1.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Ghouls of the Northern Army command are once more interacting with the surface. The civilian population is for now still kept underground, as threats are dealt with. As all NAC events, this should be written in the style of a propaganda broadcast. They are extremely patriotic for Equestria, and love the Princesses and the Ministries."
command.1.a:0 "Raise the flags high!"

command.2.t:0 "Creeping Change"
command.2.d:0 "WIP\n\nDue to the expansion of our forces, and attrition on the surface, the §OReserve§! is slowly loosing it's relevance, and has to include more and more non-ghouls and conscripts to make up their numbers. Their organization is weakening, but their standards are still high."
command.2.a:0 "Our brave §OReserve§! shall prevail!"

command.3.t:0 "Cracks in the Reserve"
command.3.d:0 "WIP\n\nWith the sheer size of our armed forces, and the losses we have taken in fighting for Princessyn, the original members of the §OReserve§! now make up only a small part of our military. We can still utilize an adjusted version of their training regimen to ensure the superiority of our troops, but their insane standards won't survive in this new Wasteland age."
command.3.a:0 "All together in the §CCDF§!"
