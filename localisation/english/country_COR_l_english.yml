 vermillionists.1.d:0 "WIP\ntalks about the people of Kucyków being up in arms, and any perceived 'Class traitor' being dragged into the streets and beaten to death. Then tells you that the Assembly of Hearts have re-structured the parties, and Lord Vermillion Grace has taken temporary leadership of the new Government."
 vermillionists.1.a:0 ""
 
 vermillionists.2.t:0 "An offer from the Vermillionists"
 vermillionists.2.d:0 "A small delegation from the Revolutionaries in the Commonwealth arrived in our great city today, bearing a document that they wish us to sign.\nThe Document beseeches us to support these 'Fellow Comrades in the fight for Liberty', as Lord Vermillion Grace describes his people, in their war against the Royalists on our eastern border.\nThis support would entail sending fighters and equipment, as well as military advisors, which would return after the war.\n\nIn exchange for such support, the new Government in Kucyków has offered to recognize our claims to the lands surrounding Novochernusk, and acknowledge us an an independant Country. They would also forfeit all prior claims of the Commonwealth towards our lands, for whatever that is worth\n\nWe should be cautious to believe their claims of future support, but this might be a great opportunity to make a very powerful ally.\n\nOf course, there is always the Risk that the Vermillionists loose the civil war, and we'd be caught in a hostile situation against the Royalists, but that should be a neglible concern.\nWe need to decide now, and swiftly mobilize, should we opt for intervention..."
 vermillionists.2.a:0 "We accept."
 vermillionists.2.b:0 "Deny their request"
 
 vermillionists.3.t:0 "Novochernusk accepted our Proposal"
 vermillionists.3.d:0 "Our allies in Novochernusk have accepted our proposal to intervene on our side in the Civil-war.\nThe treaty stipulates that they hand over any Commonwealth land they seize in the conflict, and also promises them that we will never fully annex them in the future, though the future shall see if we truly have to abide by that.\nThis will surely quicken the Civil-war and secure our Victory over the Royalists."
 vermillionists.3.a:0 "The Revolution marches on."
 
 vermillionists.4.t:0 "Novochernusk Mobilizes for Intervention"
 vermillionists.4.d:0 "Those shady Republicans and Lunarists in Novochernusk have recently started to mobilize their army to their eastern Border, no doubt with the intention of intervening in the ongoing Civil-war in the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Dictatorius and his council have decided that such an action cannot stand unanswered, and given orders for general mobilization as well.\nWe will send a missive to Stalwart Shield, leader of the Royalist faction, and align ourselves with her, though she will get nothing but platitudes and moral support from us!.\nInstead of outright intervention, we will use this opportunity to drill our troops and rattle sabers for some minor political concessions. After all, it matters not who wins the Civil war in the Commonwealth, for the rightful ruler of all the Broken Plains already occupies the High seat of the Council of Stratusburg...\n\nSoon, Stratusburg will show the world its strength!"
 vermillionists.4.a:0 "Let them kill eachother"
 vermillionists.4.b:0 "Maybe we should beack down?"
 
 vermillionists.5.t:0 "Stratusburg mobilizes"
 vermillionists.5.d:0 "Our intelligence network has been in upraor for the past few days, as reports of both Novochernusk, and then Stratusburg mobilizing trickled in.\nToday, we finally have confirmation of what is going on:\nNovochernusk seems to have sided with the damned Vermillionists, and is preparing to invade our lands from the west.\nNot wanting to see their rival gain any power, Stratusburg has now mobilized as well, preparing for a war against Novochernusk and the Vermillionists.\n\nA short message from their Dictatorius informed us that Stratusburg intends to act as a loose ally of ours in the fight against the vile rebels. In exchange for their help, they request that we do not interfere with their occupation of Novochernusk, and hand over any territory we aquire from them. They will likewise hand over any Commonwealth-territory back to us, once the war has concluded.\nWhile Stratusburg itself is a traitorous province of the Commonwealth, we don't really have a choice but to accept their offer.\nWe can always betray them at a later point..."

vermillionists.504.d:0 "WIP\n\nStratusburg has refused our call to arms, citing peace, treaties and general unwillingness of their population to die for 'some revolution'."
vermillionists.504.a:0 "Traitors twice over..."

vermillionists.3001.t:0 "The Victors return home"
vermillionists.3001.d:0 "WIP\n\nOur volunteers that were sent to help the [COR.GetName] in their revolution have at long last returned home! Though some of them have fallen, they non-theless bring with them valuable combat experience, and proof that the General's plans are to all our benefit!"
vermillionists.3001.a:0 "Throw a grand feast for our heroes!"

vermillionists.7.t:0 "Innauguration of the Revolutionary Congress"
vermillionists.7.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Government, called the Revolutionary Congress has today begun it's first session as the replacement of the old Assembly of Hearts. Lord-Comrade Vermillion Grace gives a short opening speech about revolutionary unity, and how proud he is to be able to lead this esteemed body. After that the Assembly quickly begins discussing matters of reconstruction and the looming war with the Khaganate."
vermillionists.7.a:0 "This democracy is what we fought for!"

vermillionists.8.t:0 "Salting the wounded Land"
vermillionists.8.d:0 "WIP\n\nRemnants of the Royalist Army have attacked and slaughtered our garrison in Rzedavny. They then proceeded to burn down the houses and fields of any Proud revolutionaries, before dragging 9 of these so called 'Collaborators' into the town square, where they were executed after a mock trial. The local population has been of no help in tracking or identifying the Royalist Scum. §tCrystal Drop§! suspects they still hold strong royalist sympathies, and has ordered and investigation."
vermillionists.8.a:0 "The war continues in the Shadows..."

vermillionists.9.t:0 "Results of the Rzedavny Investigation"
vermillionists.9.d:0 "WIP\n\nOur investigation has revealed that a number of ponies in Rzedavny are actively supporting the Counterrevolution. Some even have family in the Royalist remnant that slaughtered our people. While Light Ray advises we let the counterrevolution burn itself out, and not resort to drastic measures, not everypony is so level headed. The §RRadicals§! under §RPirog Granatov§! demand we send in a Division of the Revolutionary army, drag out every confirmed Royalist supporter into the street and summarily execute them for crimes against the Revolution. §gGolden Deal§! is opposed to such a brutish move, and instead suggests we infiltrate their local cells and buy the loyalty of some of the less fanatical royalists."
vermillionists.9.a:0 "Ignore them for now"
vermillionists.9.b:0 "§RSend in the Troops!§!"
vermillionists.9.c:0 "§gInfiltrate their cells§!"

vermillionists.10.t:0 "Eye for an Eye"
vermillionists.10.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Counterrevolutionary Army has launched mass-reprisals against our executing of their associates in Rzedavny. All across the occupied regions small groups of insurgents launched attacks on small villages and isolated farmsteads. Once more, they are targeting vermillionist supporters, but this time also the families of our soldiers.\nThe §RRadicals§! demand we retaliate in kind, and have the army sweep the land executing everypony we suspect to potentially support the Counter-Revolution. The rest of the Congress favors consolidating our position and preparing for a slow and methodical rooting out of the Insurgents. Of course, this slower approach would allow them to strengthen their position in the short term..."
vermillionists.10.a:0 "Consolidate and prepare"
vermillionists.10.b:0 "§RIf it is blood they want, they can drown in it!§!"

vermillionists.11.t:0 "The Fruits of Patience"
vermillionists.11.d:0 "WIP\n\nGolden Deal's strategy of infiltrating counter-revolutionary cells has turned out to be a full success! After months of infiltration and buying off informants that the insurgents use. the trap finally snapped shut tonight. 261 Members of the Counter-revolutionary forces have been killed or apprehended as our forces moved in on their hideouts. Now it is only a question of who gets to claim the glory of this success. While §gGolden Deal§! was the one who came up with the idea, §tCrystal Drop§! had taken charge of coordinating the strikes that finally apprehended the Insurgents."
vermillionists.11.a:0 "§gGolden Deal deserves the Praise§!"
vermillionists.11.b:0 "§tCrystal Drop should get the Glory§!"

vermillionists.12.t:0 "Caught in the Open"
vermillionists.12.d:0 "WIP\n\nConsolidating after the Insurgents launched country-wide attacks did what we indendet to do. Today, the Counter-revolutionaries attempted another large-scale attack, but this time we were prepared. Instead of being able to attack and slip away before we could respond, our forces directly engaged multiple insurgent cells in combat. Their equipment was run-down and while they fought zealously, mortar-fire and machineguns silenced them quickly. Of special note is an insurgent cell that planned to sabotage the Platinum Heart in Kucykow, which was only discovered thanks to §OLight Ray's§! contacts within the Celestial Church. He is trying to use this fact to improve his own political standing, but we could instead frame this success as the victory of reason over radicalism."
vermillionists.12.a:0 "§OLet Light Ray shine§!"
vermillionists.12.b:0 "Blame the Radicals"

vermillionists.13.t:0 "The Bloodied Frontier"
vermillionists.13.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Insurgents wished to see the Commonwealth bloodied, and now they ahve gotten their wish. What they likely did not anticipate is that the Radicals would systematically go through every city and village with Army units and armed mobs. Everyone with even the slightest bit of doubt as to their loyalty to the revolution was dragged from their houses, lined up in the streets and executed in short order. Nopony on all Equus shall doubt that we are willing to do anything to guard the revolution, no matter how... distasteful. The Counter-revolutionaries will undoubtedly have lost supply lines, supporters and family today, and that is good!"
vermillionists.13.a:0 "Traitor or Revolutionary, the blood runs §RRED!§!"

vermillionists.14.t:0 "Velika Harbor-Skirmishes"
vermillionists.14.d:0 "WIP\n\nA group of revolutionaries unaffiliated with our government, calling themselves the 'Brass Buttons' has engaged and seemingly wiped out one of the remaining Counter-revolutionary cells in Velika. The insurgents appear to have used several decommissioned ships as their hideouts to stoke insurrection throughout the state. The Brass Buttons engaged with them in a shootout lasting nearly 2 hours, culminating in the ships, and a good chunk of the harbour being burned to the ground."
vermillionists.14.a:0 "Affiliated or not, they serve the Revolution"

vermillionists.15.t:0 "Gone in the Night"
vermillionists.15.d:0 "WIP\n\nConcerning developments from the former holdings of the Magocracy. Homesteaders and villagers have started appearing in the night. From the scant few reports we have gotten, they seemed to have willingly walked away from homes and families at a whim. However, now that one of them was caught by her sister before she could disappear, it is clear what is happening. Somepony is mind-controlling these ponies at an impressive distance, and leading them to who-knows where. This leaves us only one conclusion: Unseen Spiral of the Council of Spring is not only still alive, but continues to operate in the Commonwealth. Most likely he is either supporting one of the COunter-revolutionary cells or has started his own insurgent-operation."
vermillionists.15.a:0 "Double the Night-guards!"

vermillionists.16.t:0 "Our best and brightest"
vermillionists.16.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe VKDR is working tirelessly to root out the Counter-revolutionaries. Today, Swift Prance is inducting a new wave of recruits into the organization. Finally they get to see the secret headquaters and renew their oaths of loyalty to the revolution. They are the best and brightest of the Commonwealth, and will surely carry the revolution to new heights! The oath-ceremony is interrupted by strange sounds in the distance, and an agent burting into Prance's room telling her that there have been explosions throughout the city. Prance barely catches one of the new recruits bulling something under his uniform, and manages to throw up a shield before the world turns white and red. Prance survives, but the other recruits and a number of her agents were not so fortunate. Looking through the new hole in the walls of the headquaters, she sees columns of smoke rising across the city."
vermillionists.16.a:0 "How did we not catch this?"

vermillionists.17.t:0 "Untangling the Strings"
vermillionists.17.d:0 "WIP\n\nA month has passed since the bombings across Kucyków and the VKDR has worked tirelessly to investigate the incidents. Most concerning of course, being that one of their own recruits got through their screening processes and managed to detonate himself in the headquaters. Our best Arcane forensics has revealed that all the suicide bomber across the city, 14 in total, were deeply brainwashed, and implanted with subconcious triggers so subtle our screening processes did not catch them. Swift Prance knows that there is only one Pony in the Commonwealth capable of such meticulous mind-control: Unseen Spiral. The Mage had always been the most concerning member of the Spring Council, but now they had witnessed first hoof how dangerous and ruthless he truly was. Now, they would have to decide if they wanted to simply re-screen their agents and other high officials to prevent them from being compromised, or mobilize the resources for a large scale investigation into the hundreds of potential suspects that could be mind-controlled."
vermillionists.17.a:0 "Clear the VKDR and Congress"
vermillionists.17.b:0 "Give them whatever resources they require!"

vermillionists.18.t:0 "No more strings"
vermillionists.18.d:0 "WIP\n\nAfter a long investigation and thorough analysis of the reports of disappearing villagers, we were finally able to narrow the likely position of Unseen Spiral's hideout to 3 locations. In the middle of the night agents of the VKDR led military strike-teams in attacks against all three locations. One location proved a dud, but the other two offered heavy resistance, with mind-controlled ponies fighting without regard for their lives. When team 2 confirmed a sighting of Unseen Spiral, currently in the process of casting a concerningly powerful spell, his location was passed on via radio, and his fate thusly sealed. A team of VKDR mages teleported in on his location and in a brief exchange of spells killed Unseen Spiral, though not before he managed to erase all memories of one of the mages, and turned another to glass. Unfortunately, the ponies that Spiral mind-controlled were not simply released, but instead began killing themselves in a bout of mania likely triggered by some failsafe in the brainwashing. A bitter victory, but one of the greatest threats to the revolution is finally dead."
vermillionists.18.a:0 "These agents are heroes of the Revolution."

vermillionists.20.t:0 "Rise of the Sorceror-King"
vermillionists.20.d:0 "WIP\n\nAfter the bombing of Kucyków we thought we'd seen the worst Unseen Spiral was capable of... we were mistaken. Reports flooded in this morning of strange lights in the sky north of Limua, and outposts going dark one after the other. The terible truth became apparent this morning, as hundreds, maybe thousands of armed ponies took to the streets of every town and village in the States of Velika and Peresniye. Their trancelike movements, and uncanny coordination belies that they are being mind controlled on a scale not seen since the great war. At 09:00 Unseen Spiral took control of a military radio station and announced his intention to the whole Commonwealth:\nThat he had risen as the Sorceror-King to smash the false revolution. That Vermillionism brought no true unity, and that the end of war could only be achieved in conjunction with the end of individuality. All should submit and join their minds under the benevolent reign of the Sorceror-King, so that war and pain are but a faint memory.\nAfter the Speech, Spiral's puppet-soldiers began crossing the border and engaging our troops... It seems we have a another civil war."
vermillionists.20.a:0 "Down with the crazed despot!"

vermillionists.21.t:0 "Our thoughts are free"
vermillionists.21.d:0 "WIP\n\nAfter a brutal battle, the last stronghold of the Witchking was finally broken. Unseen Spiral barely resembled a pony anymore when our elite forces found him, His horn grown overlong and twisted, shards of green crystal sprouting from his body and hundreds of rune marks carved into his flesh. The 'Sorceror King' required an entire elite Special forces team, and some of the finest mages of the VKDR to put down, seemingly transferring any wound he received to one of the ponies he controlled. When the spell was finally unravelled, Unseen Spiral vanished in a great spout of balefire, hopefully incinnerated for good. There exists of course the small possibility that he used some sort of disguised teleportation-spell, but our mages assure that even if he did, the balefire was real and wherever he teleported too, he would still come out as a charred husk of a pony. For safety reasons, the team that confronted him has been put under quarantine, since many of them reported hearing an unsettling singing when fighting the Sorceror. For now though, it is time to celebrate, and Vermillion Grace wishes to name one of the planners of the operation a §dHero of the Revolution§!. The question is just... who?"

vermillionists.23.t:0 "Counter-Revolutionary Uprising"
vermillionists.23.d:0 "WIP\n\nIn former Royalist territories in the north, a new enemy has arisen. The royalists, led by Lady Ingenue, now calling herself the 'Grand Protectress of the Commonwealth', seem to finally have amassed enough forces to face us in the open battle. Their forces are nearly identical in size to the Royalist army of the first civil war, but of course we are much better prepared this time. We beat them when we had to rise up from nothing, and this time we have the entire Industry of the Commonwealth at our backs."
vermillionists.23.a:0 "Time to end this threat for good."

vermillionists.24.t:0 "Victory in the Civil war... again"
vermillionists.24.d:0 "WIP\n\nFor the second time in less than 2 years, we have beaten the royalist menace back into their holes! Whatever scattered remnants of this 'Army of Revolt' remain have scattered to the forests or fled across the border, but not many survived this time. Lady Ingenue, their leader, was captured during the battle for Nyzlamnie, and, though in rough condition from multiple gunshot wounds, has already proposed to be executed by the Revolutionary Congress. In fact, all four major parties have started their own bills calling for Ingenues execution, all seeking to gain the recognition by being the ones to condemn this vile Royalist to death.

vermillionists.25.t:0 "Political mergers"
vermillionists.25.d:0 "WIP\n\nIn a move only the most savy insiders of the Revolutionary Congress could have predicted, the Universal Prosperity Mandate, and the Socialist Innovation League have merged together. The SIL has been formally dissolved, and it's members absorbed by the UPM. Golden Deal, leader of the UPM then gave a short speech before officially stepping down and opening new party-internal elections. First on the table was the name of the new party, which was decided to merge elements of both to be called the §OUniversal Innovation Collective§!. During the election of the new Party leader, Golden Deal was re-elected, and promised to change his policies to take the former SIL's more technocratic ideals into account. The new party stands for a partial re-introduction of controlled capitalism, and a heavy focus on industry and education over military or diplomatic matters."
vermillionists.25.a:0 "They might actually ahve a shot at leadership now"

vermillionists.26.t:0 "The Burning Steppe"
vermillionists.26.d:0 "WIP\n\nA Cossack Army general is terrorizing our northern territories. Burning Steppe and her followers seem to enjoy a good deal of support from local Cossacks, who hide her soldiers and rat out the positions of our outposts and patrols. Every other day, one of our officers goes missing, or a patrol takes fire from masked assailants. Unlike the royalists, Burning Steppe seems less interested in wanton violence, with casualties low on both sides, and disappeared officers often released a few days later, with their coat shaved, and some unflattering facial tattoos. Nevertheless, these humilitations make it quite difficult to hold onto cossack territories."
vermillionists.26.a:0 "Another wannabe Warlord to deal with..."

vermillionists.27.t:0 "The Rayoreyda Massacre"
vermillionists.27.d:0 "WIP\n\nAn unfortunate setback for the revolution, as a local officer in Rayoreyda failed to maintain crowd control during a protest, leading to our soldiers pannicking and opening fire into the crowd. 24 Ponies died, 22 of them protestors, 1 onlooker who was hit by a stray shot, and one soldier who commited suicide during the cleanup operation. In the hours following the massacre, many towns in the region burned revolutionary flags and chased our officials out. It is sad to say, but a single misstep like this, and a good number of the affected are likely to seek out the counterrevolution, though the VKDR is hard at work intercepting them. It will take a long time to win back the trust of our citizens in Rayoreyda."
vermillionists.27.a:0 "Most unfortunate"

vermillionists.28.t:0 "Purges in the Armed forces"
vermillionists.28.d:0 "WIP\n\nNow that the Revolutionary Army is being transformed into a proper standing military, we will need to be careful of the traditionally royalist military. Parts of the army will almost certainly harbour counter-revolutionary elements, and we'll need to decide to which extend we wish to purge them..."

vermillionists.32.d:0 "WIP\n\nOur plans of a completely planned economy have encountered a somewhat serious snag, as they did not account for a drought this year. The great farming collectives turned out to be too slow in reacting to conditions, and measures for drought relief were locked behind too many bureaucratic processes. Luckily, we will be able to stave off starvation wit the reserves we've built up, but it will still be a lean few months. §OGolden Deal§! and the Innovation Collective have taken this opportunity to rip into government policy, and try to steer the Commonwealth towards restricted capitalism isntead."

To prevent a number of important factories from closing, the government had to step in and shoulder the debt acrued. We will have to tighten the budget for the coming quater, but this will pass. However, this was the last straw for non-state lending, as all the banks are being nationalized and put under direct oversight."

The vast majority of them sided with our enemies in the civil war, or simply opted to hide on their estates until the violence was over. Now they shall reap what they have sown! The few nobles that supported the Revolution will voluntarily lay down their titles, in a show of solidarity, and will instead be granted party-positions to ensure their loyalty. Those who fought against us will face a much more grimm fate. The worst offenders will, of course, be executed, but there are still hundreds of lesser nobles awaiting judgement. We could order them all summarily executed, and their estates repurposed as §RGranatov§! and §OGolden Deal§! suggest, as this will most certainly weaken any support the counter-reviolution has. Alternatively, §tCrystal Drop§! and §gLight Ray§! brought forward a proposal to have them all face 10 years of hard labour, in addition to their worldy riches being sold abroad to finance parts of the reconstruction. finance"

From making sure our soldiers had food, to smuggling in arms on behalf of the revolution, we would surely have failed without the red merchants. However, even among the merchants there was a good number that aligned with the royalists, and we will have to deal with those. Their wealth will of course be stripped from them, but the question of whom it shall benefit has arisen. §OGolden Deal§! has presented a plan of consolidating the confiscated wealth in a general fund to be used in the rapid re-industrialization of the Commonwealth, however, he faces strong opposition. The remaining parties, as well as the loyal merchants, want to transfer the assets to the red merchants as a reward for their support, and to ensure their future loyalty when the war with the Khan comes."

Most of the government want to use this first Liberation day to promote unity of the workers who stayed with the refugees who are quickly returning to the Commonwealth. Funds for relief camps and soup kitchens have thusly been allocated, however §RGranatov§! and the Radicals are holding up the motion in the Revolutionary Congress. In the minds of many radicals, the refugees are only one step above the traitors we fought against, and don't deserve handouts until they've proven themselves loyal to the revolution. Therefore, §RGranatov§! put forward his own motion to spend the allocated funds on a lavish military parade, and one-time payments to soldiers of the Revolutionary Army."

They call themselves the §G'Green Devils'§! and mainly attack trade-caravans and the occasional military convoy. Barely better than raiders, they still present a threat to our itnernal security. However, due to them constantly being on the move, and taking great care to cover their tracks, we have not been able to track them down. The question has arisen as to how many resources should be allocated towards tracking this group down. While we could simply ignore them, many argue for taking preventative measures and guard our caravans better, so as to starve them out. Some voices however call a grand military effort be made in conjunction with the increased security, to track them down once and for all!"

We were unable to force them into a decisive engagement, but after finally getting good intel, we were able to track their general location, and engage in several skirmishes over the last months. Their forces have drastically lessened, and today our agents in Bordolis have reported that the remnants of the Devils have fled there and pledged allegiance to the local Gang-lords.

The Socialist, or as they themselves call it 'Vermillionist' government, in the Commonwealth seems to have cemented its power and is now reaching out to other followers of Marks. Among their gifts are a number of books, mainly on military history, but also their political ideology, as well as the parts for a long-range radio station, with which they suggest we stay in contact with their government in Kucyków. Their brand of Marksism is quite different from ours, even still allowing for merchants and former locals to hold some power, but can we really be picky about allies in these times?"

We could keep it to a reasonable level, that doesn't inconvenience our population too much, but we could also take it further. By essentially borrowing against the future, we can mobilize enourmous amounts of capital and ponypower to create a war-machine that could rival or even eclipse Red Eye's Empire.

The first was a rifle bullet enchanted with a scarily effective shieldbreaker spell, and if our historians are right, it is likely of the same, or at least similar, make of the bullets used in the Assassination attempt against Princess Celestia during the great war. The second bullet, fired from the strange plastic pistol the attacker that was beaten to death by the crowd carried, was instead enchanted with necromantic spells. Tests have revealed the necromantic spells powerful enough, that even a graze with the bullet would have led to the targets death within 30 seconds from rapid-onset necrosis. Sadly, the attacker we have was already dead when we got to him, and the second shooter seems to have vanished after firing their shot. For now, the trail has run cold..."

The WLF is by far the most radical of our parties, seeing Vermillions reforms as far too mild, and seeking to exterminate the Nobles and disenfranchise the merchants. Not only that, Granatov wishes to take the revolution global, and intends to eventually attack all of our neighbours in an effort to unify every Creature under the Banner of Socialism.
