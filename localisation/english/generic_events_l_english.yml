generic_law_event.1.t:0 "Profits From Chem Trade"
generic_law_event.1.d:0 "Our government doesn’t care much about the chem use, or trade, of its citizenry, except on how it can profit from the trade. Chem dealers might not be the smartest ponies in the wasteland, but they know well enough to give a cut of their trade to their local authorities, to keep them happy. The local authorities then give a cut of their cut up to those above them, and then those above them, until a small percentage of the chem trade ends up as caps in the bank of the country.\n\n It’s been a particularly good month for the chem traders, selling to citizens, soldiers, and many others, making quite the profit off of it. Lucky for us, that means now we have some more caps to spend on whatever we want. The coffers are more full than before, ready to be used as the government wishes."
generic_law_event.1.a:0 "Profits Are High"

generic_law_event.2.t:0 "Dashers Division"
generic_law_event.2.d:0 "Good news comes from the conscription centers today! There’s been a group of Dash-Heads, though they prefer to call themselves Dashers, from a small settlement who signed up for the military. Apparently this group abused Dash, a drug which speeds one up and makes them feel on top of the world, and traveled around doing quests in their local settlement. Somehow they got their hooves on some ancient swords and went around beating up bandits, saving kidnapped ponies, and helping old mares cross the streets.\n\n Apparently the Dashers, as they call themselves, decided they could do more than help in small quests around the village. So they marched themselves right up to a conscription center, with their ancient weapons, and declared a so-called oath of service to our country. While they might be a bit eccentric compared to the normal soldiers, they’re fresh and eager bodies ready to be sent to the front, and their swords are better weapons than nothing."
generic_law_event.2.a:0 "We Dashers Serve!"

generic_law_event.3.t:0 "Buck Broncos"
generic_law_event.3.d:0 "Some mixed news comes in today from a settlement within our country. One of our settlements is nearby to an abandoned factory from the war, which was filled with some robots and automatic defenses, too much effort to break into and restore. Well, a local group of young stallions and mares, who reportedly were very bored, took some Buck. Buck is a drug that allows one to feel like they’re the strongest pony in the wasteland, allowing ponies to hit a lot harder than before, and take a lot harder hits without even noticing.\n\n After taking the Buck, the group of ponies, ten in number, decided they could clear the nearby factory. So they did, they went in, and despite getting shot and heavily wounded, they managed to destroy all of the security in the factory. However, in the fight, they destroyed much of the factory, making it useless for future production. Luckily, they found a box of guns in storage from early in the war, and they dragged it before the local authority to give to the government. They all then collapsed dead as soon as the Buck wore off. At least the guns can be put to use."

generic_law_event.4.t:0 "Hydra Horrors"
generic_law_event.4.d:0 "Disturbing news comes from a small settlement on the outskirts of the country, about a new group calling themselves The Hydras. They seem to be abusers of the chem Hydra, which enhances natural regeneration and healing rates, to a staggering extent. Hydra, when used properly, can be great to help heal limbs, or broken bones, or even stop fatal wounds. However, this group doesn’t use it for any of those reasons.\n\n Reports from local authorities state that The Hydras have been driven insane by their drug use, to the point that they’ve started to self-cannibalize. According to witnesses, members of the group will take Hydra and then eat their own flesh as it regenerates, a gruesome sight for any who witness it. The settlement has tried to get them all arrested, but since there’s no laws against chem use, there’s not really anything that can be done. Unsurprisingly, the local population is not very happy about that."
generic_law_event.4.a:0 "Well, that’s horrifying!"

generic_law_event.5.t:0 "Illegal Chems Seized"
generic_law_event.5.d:0 "Chems are a poison that infects the very core of a country and rots it from within, luckily, our government knows that. When chem-heads decide they’re going to try to get away with a hit of their poison, we’re there to stop them, when dealers think they’re going to sell their venom, we’re there to stop them, and when chem makers and chem testers think they can craft their miasma to rot away our ponies, we’re there to stop them.\n\n Earlier this week, chem smugglers tried to sneak in a massive shipment of chems over our border, box upon box of Buck, Dash, Mint-Als, and every other chem one can ever imagine taking. Luckily, the smugglers had a mole, and so we were able to crack down on the smuggling attempt, arresting all smugglers and seizing their contraband. While these chems might be poison when abused, they can also serve as valuable medicine to study, so the government has distributed the seized chems to researchers and medical professionals."
