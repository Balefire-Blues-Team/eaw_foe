state_lore_text_container_state_name_532:0 "The §YCity§! of §YSlaves§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_532:0 "§YFillydelphia§!, once the rival of Manehattan in population and industry, overtook the City That Never Sleeps during the war, being the center of Equestrian industrial output making everything from guns, tanks, and planes to toasters, cars, and TV’s. This made it a prime target for the Zebrican Balefire bombs, though it wasn't as hard-hit as Manehattan, leaving much of the city's impressive industry intact. Despite this, the city was still plagued with disease, monsters, and horrific mutations caused by the mix of pollution and balefire radiation. But this didn’t stop §RRed Eye's§! brutal conquest the city, driving out the mutants and steel rangers and wastelanders alike until he claimed the ultimate prize: the famed factories of the City of Sisterly Love.\n\nToday the industrial center and much of the outskirts is under Red Eye's control, being the economic powerbase behind his slavers. Like they did 200 years ago, the smog producing factories churn out tools of war and peace alike, all of the backbreak physical labor undertaken by the thousands of slaves overseen by the cruel and vicious slavers. Love is long lost from this city and all that remains is the smell of smog and the crack of the whip."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_19:0 "The last surviving vestige of the once iconic §YBucklyn Bridge§!, the Balefire bombs and the resulting apocalypse reduced the once mighty landmark to a lone, towering reminder of the city that once was. A near impregnable fortress, it wasn't surprising that when the §CSteel Rangers§! came to the ruins of Manehattan, they chose Bucklyn Cross as their base of operations. The Manehattan Contingent made a home out of the maintenance tunnels that snaked within and under it, barracks and workshops and labs are crammed into every available space. Knights and Initiates train on the open asphalt of the small section of road still standing, while Scribes toil away inside, cataloging and preserving every piece of technology brought back to the Cross. Below, at the water of the Mare River, the Rangers have constructed an impressive winch system, able to lift boats out of the water and deliver ponies and technology to their citadel.\n\nAt the lowest level lies §GThe Vault§!, a massive, protected area that serves to hold the entirety of the Manehattan Contingent's hoard; Water talismans, power armor, prototypes longs thought lost to the wastes, all stored within, all collecting dust in the name of \"preservation\". Perhaps even more impressively, The Vault is a post-war construction, dug out and built up by the Rangers shortly after they moved into Bucklyn Cross."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_39:0 "Friendship City once was known as the §YStatue of Friendship§!, a shining beacon to all who passed by or went into the city of Manehattan that they were entering a place like know other. Even after the Great War came to its devastating climax with the detonation of the megaspells, the Statue of Friendship stood strong. Standing tall as a beacon of hope to all who saw it. As the years went by many ponies began to congregate towards the statue, as they viewed it as not only a beacon, but also as a suitable location for a potentially lasting settlement. A settlement that would become known as §CFriendship City§!.\n\nThe Statue of Friendship, whose body and base have started to decay with time, was patched up and turned into a municipality of various stores, homes, schools, hotels, and whatever else settlers could think of to try any turn this place into a real community. These ponies hard work would culminate over the years with Friendship City turning into one of the most well-known and safest settlements in the whole of the Equestrian wasteland."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_593:0 "Red Eye's §YCathedral§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_593:0 "The §GEverfree forest§! is a hostile place, full of dangerous beasts and dark magic the likes of which are unmatched by the rest of Equestria. In the two centuries following the end of the world, this already wild land only grew more so, quickly gaining a reputation for being one of the deadliest locations in the Wasteland. It would only be fitting that one of the greatest monsters in Equestria was born within it. Deep within the depths of the forest stood a structure from long before the Great War. It was the site of another tragedy, a damning fight that almost plunged Equestria into eternal night. Under its ancient foundations, §YStable 101§! was built. A Stable committed to the 'earth pony way', with ingenuity its core principle. The technology at their disposal was rumored to be nothing short of astounding, with amazing advancements in the fields of cybernetics and medicine that were near unthinkable even by the end of the Great War.\n\nNow, that Stable has been given a new purpose; One bestowed upon it by §RRed Eye§!, to aid him in rebuilding a new world. The ancient ruins above it have been built upon, turned into the foundation for a much greater structure that signifies its Master's rule: §YThe Cathedral§!. A grand tower serving as the seat of power for Red Eye, from which he works on his long term plans for the Wasteland. And perhaps, within the depths of his home, he works on §rsomething even greater§!..."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_518:0 "Maripony"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_518:0 "The §YHome§! of the §YGoddess§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_518:0 "Like the face of Equestria itself, the land on which the Maripony Facility is constructed altered and morphed over the course of the Great War. Originally, the location was known as Splendid Valley, and was the location which Equestria's population of Diamond Dogs called home. Although it did not appear resplendent to the naked eye, to the Diamond Dogs, it was truly beautiful. Deep within the earth were caverns upon caverns of gemstones, which made it a natural magnet for their kind, yet it also made it a target for exploitation when Equestria was at war to fund its conflict or to power matrices for its technological advancement.\n\nAt first the native population resisted, until the military was dragged in and they were forcibly expelled. Within short order, great strip mines dwarfing whatever complexes were initially used by the miners in Old Olneigh were erected, and the valley was exhumed of every scrap of mineral wealth that it still contained. When Equestria was finally through sapping the dregs of the valley, it was left as a barren, lifeless scar upon the region. A few Diamond Dogs attempted to return, but the area was still under the occupation of the military, and there were other plans that they had in mind for it.\n\nWith the vale useless and nearly lifeless, it was the perfect location to erect a new research facility, where nopony could be disturbed. No better condition could be asked for by Equestria's top military scientists. At times, Ministry Mare Twilight Sparkle was seen at the facility, and it was rumored that she was experimenting on a project that could end the war with few, if any lives lost. However, whatever she was working on was no doubt lost when the facility itself was struck directly by a balefire bomb, which if it did not kill all those inside instantly, would have surely left the location in lockdown until their supplies were used up and they starved or perished from dehydration.\n\n After the Last Day, Maripony went dark. As the rest of Equus and Zebrica, it stood as a solemn reminder of the hubris of its leaders. Some of the Diamond Dogs attempted to return to their tunnels and homes in Splending Valley, but the balefire radiation and Taint—something that no doubt spawned from the MAS experiments—mutated them, creating the Hellhounds that plague areas of the Wasteland today. In time, travelers who went near it claimed to see strange creatures, who resembled the Princesses of Equestria, flitting around it. These creatures called the facility home, and in time captured or expelled anycreature who resided too close.\n\nCalling themselves the Unity, they claimed all who they took in the name of their great and powerful Goddess, a being of immense power that resides within the bowels of the ancient laboratory. Maripony and Splendid Valley now lie a ruined, radioactive, toxic cancer, and as any cancer, it may some day grow into something that will be impossible to destroy. "

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_563:0 "New Appleloosa"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_563:0 "§YNew Appleloosa§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_563:0 "§YNew Appleloosa§!: the quaintest, friendliest, and safest settlement in the wasteland (also home to the finest store in the whole wasteland.) The qualities set it apart from pretty much every settlement around, especially from its sister city of §ROld Appleloosa§!, built on the remains of the old town both get their names from. Where as one is the almost picturesque vision of old Mild West town the other is a place where hundreds of ponies are moved to and from every day to feed the slave trade. New Appleloosa plays its part in this lucrative trade as well, lying near smack dab in the middle of the rail line and having some of the only §Ctrain engines§! left in the wasteland. This also means they have some of the only ponies who know how to use and maintain them. It is these things, along with being a watering station for the trains and caravans, that let the city prosper economically. Not to mention the large scrap wall surrounding the city made decades ago out of the old boxcars left rusting in their place all along the railroad tracks keeping nasty ponies and critters out. \n\nWith its position as a vital artery of trade secured and a fairly amiable attitude, the biggest threat that could ever grace the city is the jealousy its neighbors, even its southern sister city, feel about the place."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_808:0 "Junction R-7"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_808:0 "§YJunction R-7§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_808:0 "Before the world was washed in Balefire, Junction R-7 was one of many §Yrailroad junctions§! that dotted the landscape of old Equestria. And, like most junctions of it's kind, it sat in the middle of nowhere, save for the nearby §OShattered Hoof Re-Education Facility§!.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Great War and the over the subsequent years, Junction R-7 slowly grew into a makeshift community for those who found themselves working for the Shattered Hoof Raiders and their mysterious leader, §OMr. Topaz§!. While life might seem rather abysmal in Junction R-7, many still find themselves coming to the area in order to work. The promise of security and the ability to earn some caps makes this place almost seem like a little paradise in the wasteland. Especially, if your security is a group of §gTalon Mercenaries§! who decided to set up shop in the Junction."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_735:0 "Stable 2"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_735:0 "§AStable 2§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_735:0 "Stable 2 is one of the many Stable-Tec fallout shelters that were peppered throughout Equestria before the Last Day, although, like its sister stables, it was part of a grand experiment upon pony society. Were it not for one of Stable-Tec's founders and chief architect, Apple Bloom, it likely would not have been built within the general location of Ponyville, or built at all. As her family's farm, Sweet Apple Acres, was experiencing financial struggles, Apple Bloom used some of her earnings from Stable-Tec to purchase the land and use it as the site for the stable. After it was completed a few short months later, fully customized and designed by herself, she returned the land to her sister and grandmother's ownership.\n\nThere it laid unused, save for minimal staff to keep it functioning, until the balefire bombs fell. Apple Bloom's friend, Sweetie Belle, was appointed Overmare of the stable in the event of the apocalypse and her sister Applejack was provided a slot in the roster in the case of the end of the world. When that day came, the door was sealed, never to reopen.\n\nIn the two hundred years that passed since the bombs falling, Stable 2 has remained a stagnant relic of the old world's society. Descendants of both Applejack and Sweetie Belle can still trace their history to two of the greatest ponies Equestria. The overmare leads the stable with an iron grip, enforcing what was established when the door was first sealed, and that everypony remains unaware of what the surface is like. After all, if they do not know, then why would they ever want to depart? For in Stable 2, nopony ever enters, and nopony ever leaves."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_65:0 "Ponyville"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_65:0 "§YPonyville§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_65:0 "Although it was not close to one of the oldest towns in Equestria before the bombs fell, Ponyville has had a disproportionate influence on Equestrian pre-war history. When it was founded by the Apple Family after discovering a rare fruit there, hundreds and later thousands would call the sleepy village home as the land was tilled and artisan crafts took root. It was the town which all six Ministry Mares called home, as well as all three founders of Stable-Tec, as well as Big Macintosh, the soldier who valiantly sacrificed himself to protect Princess Celestia from an assassination attempt.\n\nDuring the war, Ponyville life remained largely unchanged, save for the the establishment of Ironshod Firearms, which employed a chunk of the town in furnishing weapons for Equestria's troops. After Big Mac's sacrifice, a memorial was established for him to honor his sacrifice and for friends and family to pay respect whenever they wished. However, life went on with little interruption within the settlement, and at least to some, it was like the war never raged beyond their town's borders. Other points of note within Ponyville were Sugarcube Corner, the old employer of Ministry Mare Pinkie Pie; Carousel Boutique, which was established by Ministry Mare Rarity; and the Golden Oak Library, which was home to Ministry Mare Twilight Sparkle after she moved to Ponyville and worked with her then-new friends to stop Nightmare Moon.\n\nSince the bombs fell, ponies have wondered if it might have been better if Twilight Sparkle had simply ended Nightmare Moon rather than reform her, as it was the zebra's belief that Princess Luna was corrupted by the stars and still under their command that partly fueled the war. However, the speculation has been pondered to death, and the only answer that remains is the result of Twilight's act of mercy.\n\nIn the present day, Ponyville has been completely abandoned of any civilian population. While it was not a target of any bombs, a number were shot down over Whitetail Woods, which is near the town. The ensuing fallout polluted the ground and water supply, and much of it still currently taints the land. With the abandonment of its population, roving gangs of raiders have taken up residence, sometimes working together, sometimes duking it out for dominance over their claimed territory. Close to the outskirts of Ponyville lies Sweet Apple Acres, and within it, Stable 2. The stable's doors have remained shut for centuries, but if the residents, if they're alive, were to ever emerge, they would experience a very rude awakening to modern Equestrian life."
