state_lore_text_container_state_name_532:0 "The §YCity§! of §YSlaves§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_532:0 "One of the largest cities of pre-war Equestria and an early hub of the §gIndustrial Revolution§!, the megalopolis of §YFillydelphia§! became one of the most important cities during the Great War. Although smaller than its sister city, §YManehattan§!, the City that Never Sleeps, it in time surpassed it in both prestige and population as the war dragged on, as its factories spread across the landscape and ever demanded more workers to feed the hungry forges. While Manehattan became a hub of §tintelligentsia§! to advance the war, Fillydelphia was the beating heart of the war effort.\n\nIn Fillydelphia it was said that anything and everything could be bought in the strip malls and merchant quarters or built somewhere in the sprawling industrial parks. Although the city was never the cleanest after the Industrial Revolution, with the rapid expansion necessary for a war with the zebras, red tape and regulations were effectively non-existent if an industrialist could argue a case for his or her enterprise being critical to "fighting the Stripes." §LSmog and soot§! was the norm as production churned away such wonders as mass-produced robots and magically-powered energy weapons, or mundane consumer goods such as toasters or TVs.\n\nAs it was such a vital part of the Equestrian war machine, Fillydelphia was a top list of targets for the zebras on the §RLast Day§!. Perhaps it could be said that it fared better than Canterlot, given that it was not poisoned by the §PPink Cloud§!, but the grand City of Sisterly Love was not spared the worst the zebras could offer as §7balefire bomb§! after §7balefire bomb§! rained upon the city. Multiple long-ranged strikes by the zebras decimated the infrastructure, entirely vaporized the pegasi-dominant district of Bells Air, and left a crater the size of multiple buckball fields near the heart of the city.\n\nIn the aftermath of the bombs, unrest swept the survivors as the military and police of the city were overwhelmed with the collapse of order. Further damage from the panicked citizens completely leveled Dragon Town and kicked up some hidden parasprite eggs that had outlasted the purging of the city and Celestia's own efforts to rid the infestation years prior.\n\nSince then, the city has changed hooves numerous times, with the most recent occupants being a mix of raiders and the Fillydelphian contingent of the §CSteel Rangers§!. All were expelled or expunged from the northern half of the city as §RRed Eye§! brutally conquered any and all in his way. Complete domination was not on his mind, however, as his prize that he sought with his limited resources was easy enough to take if one had the foresight and tactical knowledge as him. All that was required were the outskirts and industrial heart, and that was a prize won with much bloodshed, though none his own.\n\nAfter his occupation, Red Eye restored the factories using technical know-how from Stable 101. This didn't come cheap, though. Those that surrendered to Red Eye were enslaved, and other ponies that he had dominated beforehoof were used in the reconstruction effort as well. However, the results were measurable. For the first time in two centuries, the §Oforges§! of Fillydelphia belched smoke and smog into the sky, mixing with the already sickly atmosphere to create a perpetual, hellish haze.\n\nEven the land is unwell, as the heavy radiation from the §7balefire bombs§! has mingled with the pollution and toxic waste of industry to leave anypony who is exposed for more than a few days at best ill, at worst, a sickly, weak, scabby excuse for a slave. In all, the city encapsulates the heart of Red Eye perfectly. The milk of pony kindness has gone sour. All that is left is the husk of a dream."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_19:0 "The §YSteel Rangers' Citadel§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_19:0 "In the pre-war days of Manehattan, the §YBucklyn Bridge§! was one of the brightest stars of the city, spanning the distance across the harbor, and enabling ponies to walk, and later drive, across it in only a matter of minutes. After the §YStatue of Friendship§!, it was the next thing to greet visitors from across the sea as their ships moored and disgorged their passengers to be swallowed by the throngs of citizens simply milling about their day.\n\nThat grandeur lasted until the §Rvery end§!, even outliving the city of Manehattan itself to remain a symbol of the old world and a reminder of Manehattan's lost splendor. In the §7balefire bombs§!, some of the bridge collapsed, but the towers that were further out into the water endured, and they remained a prize waiting for any daring and capable enough claimant. With water surrounding it on every side, and only a maze of tunnels beneath to permit access to the surface, the bridge is an almost unassailable fortress and impossible to penetrate without being provided access or attacking from the air. If the latter would occur, then the full weapons of the Manehattan Steel Ranger contingent would be brought to bear, and no doubt snipe any would be assailant out of the sky before they could say "Horseapples!"\n\nAs the heart of the §CManehattan Contingent§!, §YBucklyn Cross§! was soon turned into a home, where the Rangers could safely catalogue and sequester away any and all technology they found. As the Cross is only a section of the Bucklyn Bridge, space is at a premium, and structures for workshops, mess halls, barracks, and rec rooms dot the asphalt surface and sides of it. It's not uncommon to hear the shout of drill instructors and the clamor of dispatchers mixing with the tones of conversation and laughter from Rangers that are off duty.\n\nAt the waterline, the Rangers have constructed a winch system which can haul any boats out of the water and up to the top of the Cross to deliver supplies or technology for them. However, what is seen above the water is only a part of the Rangers' fort.\n\nTraveling deep into the labyrinthine tunnels underneath the Cross, one would find the most heavily guarded section of the entire base. Nicknamed "§Gthe Vault§!," buried into the network is a massive area meant only for hoarding everything that the Manehattan Contingent has ever collected, all in the name of "preservation." Booty such as power armor of various models, long-lost prototypes, water talismans, advanced weaponry, tanks, and more are all squared away to be studied, collected, and ultimately never used except in dire emergencies. Yet there is one thing impressive about this monument to technological greed: the Vault was constructed after the Rangers moved to the Cross.\n\nIf they could only use that technology for improving the Wasteland, instead of hiding away from it."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_39:0 "Friendship City"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_39:0 "The §YStatue§! of §YFriendship§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_39:0 "Just across the harbor from §YManehattan§! itself, the settlement of §CFriendship City§! welcomes any and all into their midst that wish to keep the peace and who have a warm and friendly attitude about them. True to its name, Friendship City is friendly, welcoming, open, and not likely to shoot you in the face as much as look at you. Undoubtedly, it's an uncommon experience in a land that would otherwise wish to see one's entrails strewn about a random toilet stall or one's head resting gently inside of an oven. Of course, the citizens of Friendship City can afford to be amicable, as their town is almost impossible to breach by conventional means, and they can pick and choose at their leisure who can and cannot enter.\n\nFriendship City is built into the remains of the §YStatue of Friendship§!, the brightest monument of pre-war Manehattan. Only a few hundred feet from the shores of the megalopolis, the statue saluted all who came through the city's port, promising that no matter where one came from, there'd always be somepony who could be chatted with or a friend that could be made. Surprisingly, it was one of the only monuments during the §RLast Day§! that was not directly targeted, and it remained as a ghostly remnant of a bygone era, a sole sentinel staring out at the §YCelestial Sea§!, never to see another visitor come to Equestria's shores.\n\nIn the years that followed the zebra's bombs, various ponies made their camp on the island, but it was some time before a concerted effort was made to utilize the statue itself. Through the combined efforts of free laborers, tradesponies, and engineers, the statue was slowly transformed into a hodgepodge mixture of platforms, box houses, sentinel posts, and control stations, although enough of the statue remains visible that the monument is recognizable from miles away.\n\nIf one is given entrance into the city through the sole bridge, called §GFriendship Bridge§!, then the murmur of discussion, the bubbling of laughter, and the shouts of haggling would great one's ears soon upon coming through its welcoming doors. A grand bazaar, where traders from across the region meet, provides ample selection to choose from. Near the bottom level, there's the §YMare's Tail Bar§!, so called due to its proximity to where the statue's tail would rest, if its makers had recalled to make one. Local governance and laws are debated on and enforced through a general council comprised of officials, another rare sight in a wasteland that rewards dictators.\n\nAs it was and will continue to be, Friendship City remains a lamp of friendship and harmony, even in a bleak and bloody wasteland that would no doubt love to topple the great statue into the sea."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_593:0 "The Cathedral"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_593:0 "§YShrine§! of the §YNew World§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_593:0 "For centuries the §5Everfree Forest§!, while dangerous to the average pony, was kept contained and placid by the efforts of settlements surrounding it. While its weather was unkempt, untamed, and unassailable on the best of days, and the creatures within refused to listen to pony reason, it was simply a footnote in travel guides. The warnings were always to look, but not venture. See, but never experience. It would be foolhardy to go inside. It'd be even more insane to try and live there.\n\nYet it was breached on occasion, most recently in Equestria's past by §PTwilight Sparkle§! and her friends to stop §2Nightmare Moon§!, and shortly thereafter by §gZecora§! the Zebra, who made herself a home there. However, regardless of how dangerous it was before the bombs fell, after the §RLast Day§!, the Everfree Forest's threat has only intensified thanks to unchecked animals and toxic radiation. Manticores gone feral. Cockatrice flocks that could petrify a hundred ponies in an instant. §2Killing Joke§!.\n\nStill, ponies did live there. And some inhabit it to this day. Thousands of years before the Great War, the vale that still resides in the heart of the Forest was home to §YPrincesses Celestia and Luna§!. From their castle, they reigned over an era of peace and prosperity for ponies, until Luna fell to the lies of the Nightmare and became Nightmare Moon. In the violent aftermath, the castle was abandoned, visited only once by the Elements in their quest to stop Nightmare Moon, then forgotten again. At least until §YStable-Tec§! began its project.\n\nAt the time, the Everfree Forest was seen as an isolated, safe location in which to shelter thousands of earth ponies from nearby Ponyville and elsewhere. §YStable 101§!, the culmination of the construction, was dedicated to the earth pony artisans and scientists, who helped iterate and develop much of the technology of Equestria during the War. Ingenuity was its core principle. Unfettered progress its intended result. When the bombs fell and the stable was sealed, the earth ponies there were left to their devices, and in the passing decades, achieved such wonders in medicine and cybernetics that they'd appear like science fiction to any pre-war ponies.\n\nWith progress comes ambition, though, and the stable that birthed miracles of science also bore one of the greatest §Omonsters§! of the Wasteland. §RRed Eye§! hails from Stable 101, and he now uses it as his fortress of solitude, where he may continue his plans for the Wasteland unbothered by the inanities of his followers.\n\nWhere there were once ruins of the alicorn sisters' castle, there is now a sprawling complex, centered around a defensive tower. Inside, Red Eye's followers devote themselves to one day bettering the Wasteland through progress. His progress. It is a superstructure bristling with turrets and lookouts, yet it is not all military. In the grand hall of the castle, the old stained glass of Canterlot's castle has been installed, giving an otherworldly, §Ppinkish light§! to Red Eye's public orations. Deeper within the complex, the old goal of Stable 101 continues with cybernetic work by §YDoc Slaughter§! and more. The lowest levels are top-secret for all but the closest of Red Eye's confidants.\n\nWhatever he plans, though, must surely be best for the Wasteland. After all, how can you improve it without cracking a few figurative eggs in the march of progress?"

state_lore_text_container_state_name_518:0 "The §YHome§! of the §YGoddess§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_518:0 "Like the face of Equestria itself, the land on which the §CMaripony Facility§! is constructed altered and morphed over the course of the Great War. Originally, the location was known as §YSplendid Valley§!, and was the location which Equestria's population of §gDiamond Dogs§! called home. Although it did not appear resplendent to the naked eye, to the Diamond Dogs, it was truly beautiful. Deep within the earth were caverns upon caverns of §3gemstones§!, which made it a natural magnet for their kind, yet it also made it a target for exploitation when Equestria was at war to fund its conflict or to power matrices for its technological advancement.\n\nAt first the native population resisted, until the military was dragged in and they were forcibly §Rexpelled§!. Within short order, great strip mines dwarfing whatever complexes were initially used by the miners in Old Olneigh were erected, and the valley was exhumed of every scrap of mineral wealth that it still contained. When Equestria was finally through sapping the dregs of the valley, it was left as a barren, lifeless §Oscar§! upon the region. A few Diamond Dogs attempted to return, but the area was still under the occupation of the military, and there were other plans that they had in mind for it.\n\nWith the vale useless and nearly lifeless, it was the perfect location to erect a new research facility, where nopony could be disturbed. No better condition could be asked for by Equestria's top military scientists. At times, Ministry Mare §tTwilight Sparkle§! was seen at the facility, and it was rumored that she was experimenting on a project that could end the war with few, if any lives lost. However, whatever she was working on was no doubt lost when the facility itself was struck directly by a §7balefire bomb§!, which if it did not kill all those inside instantly, would have surely left the location in lockdown until their supplies were used up and they starved or perished from dehydration.\n\nAfter the §YLast Day§!, Maripony went dark. As the rest of Equus and Zebrica, it stood as a solemn reminder of the hubris of its leaders. Some of the Diamond Dogs attempted to return to their tunnels and homes in Splendid Valley, but the §7balefire radiation§! and §0Taint§!—something that no doubt spawned from the §tMAS§! experiments—mutated them, creating the §gHellhounds§! that plague areas of the Wasteland today. In time, travelers who went near it claimed to see strange creatures who resembled the Princesses of Equestria flitting around it. These creatures called the facility home, and in time captured or expelled anycreature who resided too close.\n\nCalling themselves §4the Unity§!, they claimed all who they took in the name of their great and powerful §CGoddess§!, a being of immense power that resides within the bowels of the ancient laboratory. Maripony and Splendid Valley now lie a ruined, radioactive, toxic cancer, and as any cancer, it may some day grow into something that will be impossible to destroy."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_563:0 "The §YWasteland Frontier§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_563:0 "Touted as the nicest, safest, and most welcoming—unless you're a raider—community in the Wasteland, the little town of §CNew Appleloosa§! is a breath of fresh air or an oasis of friendliness in an otherwise hostile environment. §GIt even has the best store in all the Wasteland!§! Unlike so many other settlements in the former §YMild West§! and elsewhere, New Appleloosa greets all with open arms. So long as one isn't a raider.\n\nYou AREN'T a raider, right?\n\nSo long as one can answer "yes" to that question, then there is much to see in the bustling community. Although it may be small, even by Wasteland standards, there is a liveliness to New Appleloosa that is §4electric§!. In almost every way, save the train cars that make up the walls and homes of the town, it is a picturesque, perfect recreation of what the settlers of the Mild West would have experienced hundreds of years ago, which is a far cry from life in the sister city, §ROld Appleloosa§!. Unlike New Appleloosa, the latter town, residing in the remains of the original settlement, is a hellish landscape of raiders and slavers, with whom the citizens of New Appleloosa frequently interact.\n\nIf that sounds hypocritical, given the intense hatred of raiders, it is not lost on its citizens. Yet it is necessary, as it is a transit hub between the slaver town and §YRed Eye's§! empire. For the sake of their security from Red Eye and other dangers, the town permits the slavers to travel along the tracks, and given that they are some of the only ponies that know how to work and maintain the trains and crane, actively works with them in their depraved acts.\n\nAs long as the contradiction between actions and values can be ignored, New Appleloosa is a home for anypony—aside from raiders—who seeks shelter in it. With Red Eye's promised protection and an amicable attitude, threats to it are non-existent. Unless, of course, one considers the jealousy of all who know of its position of prominence a danger."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_808:0 "§YHouse§! of §YGawd§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_808:0 "Reflecting its pragmatic founding, §CJunction R-7§! does not carry a fancy name nor does it have much in the way of any draw to anycreature. At least, not any willing creature. As it is merely built around one of the myriad, pre-war §Yrailroad junctions§! of Equestria, it is not in any interesting locale nor does it have much strategic value, beyond being a place to rest one's head. The only location of interest even remotely nearby the junction is the §9Shattered Hoof Re-education Facility§!, which is currently the residence of choice of a group of raiders led by the mysterious §YMr. Topaz§!.\n\nAs he settled in, at times the raiders required more knowledge or bodies than they had, so contracting and employment, in at least strong or oppressive terms, were provided for ponies or griffons that could. To keep the facility secure, Junction R-7 was claimed and set up as a pit-stop for workers and vagabonds that needed money, food, or security. Certainly the view or tourist opportunities wouldn't be a draw, unless one wants to see the inside of one of the Shattered Hoof cells, or perhaps be on the wrong end of a §YTalon mercenary's§! gun.\n\nHowever, if safety is what one is looking for, so long as there are enough caps, it can be bought. As the junction grew, so, too, did its ability to attract hired guns and creatures who would do a job without question. One of those groups have recently set up shop, §YGawd's Talons§!, led by §LGawdyna Grimfeathers§!. Thus far, she has treated the town fairly, but tensions have begun to brew between her and the Shattered Hoof raiders. It only remains a matter of time to see who will bend first, but it is likely to be the ones who live in box cars and don't have reinforced cement walls keeping out unwanted visitors."

Throughout the decades, they have interacted little with the irradiated surface. However, knowing the importance of having a grasp of what is going on in the Wasteland, the Enclave have decided to create a permanent outpost in the middle of the §YHayseed Jungle§!, calling it §CNeighvarro§!.\n\nThis outpost, that poses as a city at the same time, is the only territory the Enclave controls on the Surface, and thus it is heavily guarded, being protected by a magic field that can be deactivated only by Enclave forces. Patrolled constantly so as to ensure its security, Neighvarro is a wonder to the surrounding jungle and marsh tribes, with some of them worshipping these pegasi as gods, while others despising the intruders that have taken their land by force.\n\nFor now, the troops of the Enclave’s sole surface settlement dutifully protect their outpost, while wastelanders watch anxiously as revanchist forces seem to gain more and more power inside the Enclave. Only time will tell how the wind blows, but one thing is certain: if ever roused, the Enclave will prove difficult to be put back to sleep. Whatever opinion one might have, it is impossible to deny that in the near future Enclave will play a decisive role in changing the Wasteland for the better or for the worse."

Were it not for one of Stable-Tec's founders and chief architect, §PApple Bloom§!, it likely would not have been built within the general location of §YPonyville§!, or built at all. As her family's farm, §RSweet Apple Acres§!, was experiencing financial struggles, Apple Bloom used some of her earnings from Stable-Tec to purchase the land and use it as the site for the stable.

Apple Bloom's friend, §6Sweetie Belle§!, was appointed Overmare of the stable in the event of the apocalypse and her sister §8Applejack§! was provided a slot in the roster in the case of the end of the world. When that day came, the door was sealed, never to reopen.\n\nIn the two hundred years that passed since the bombs falling, Stable 2 has remained a stagnant relic of the Old World's society. Descendants of both Applejack and Sweetie Belle can still trace their history to two of the greatest ponies Equestria. The §COvermare§! leads the stable with an iron grip, enforcing what was established when the door was first sealed, and that everypony remains unaware of what the surface is like.

state_lore_text_container_state_description_65:0 "Although it was not remotely close to being one of the oldest towns in Equestria before the bombs fell, §CPonyville§! has had a disproportionate influence on Equestrian pre-war history. When it was founded by the §RApple Family§! after discovering a rare fruit there, hundreds and later thousands would call the sleepy village home as the land was tilled and artisan crafts took root. It was the town which all six §8Ministry Mares§! called home, as well as all three founders of §YStable-Tec§!, and also Big Macintosh, the soldier who valiantly sacrificed himself to protect Princess Celestia from an assassination attempt.\n\nDuring the war, Ponyville life remained largely unchanged, save for the the establishment of §YIronshod Firearms§!, which employed a chunk of the town in furnishing weapons for Equestria's troops. After Big Mac's sacrifice, a memorial was established for him to honor his sacrifice and for friends and family to pay respect whenever they wished. However, life went on with little interruption within the settlement, and at least to some, it was like the War never raged beyond their town's borders. Other points of note within Ponyville were §YSugarcube Corner§!, the old employer of Ministry Mare §PPinkie Pie§!; §YCarousel Boutique§!, which was established by Ministry Mare §0Rarity§!; and the §YGolden Oak Library§!, which was home to Ministry Mare §tTwilight Sparkle§! after she moved to Ponyville and worked with her then-new friends to stop §4Nightmare Moon§!.\n\nSince the bombs fell, ponies have wondered if it might have been better if Twilight Sparkle had simply ended Nightmare Moon rather than reform her, as it was the zebras' belief that Princess Luna was corrupted by the stars and still under their command that partly fueled the Great War. However, the speculation has been pondered to death, and the only answer that remains is the result of Twilight's act of mercy.\n\nIn the present day, Ponyville has been completely abandoned of any civilian population. While it was not a target of any bombs, a number were shot down over §LWhitetail Woods§!, which is near the town. The ensuing fallout polluted the ground and water supply, and much of it still currently §Rtaints§! the land. With the abandonment of its population, roving gangs of raiders have taken up residence, sometimes working together, sometimes duking it out for dominance over their claimed territory. Close to the outskirts of Ponyville lies §RSweet Apple Acres§!, and within it, §YStable 2§!. The stable's doors have remained shut for centuries, but if the residents, if they're alive, were to ever emerge, they would experience a very rude awakening to modern Equestrian life."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_798:0 ""To stroll the streets of Cloudsdale is like walking on Cloud Nine." Such a phrase once described experiencing the bustling city of §CCloudsdale§!, the first, oldest, and largest pegasi city of Equestria before the Last Day. Although a rarity, non-pegasi ponies did occasionally experience the wonders of the metropolis, using spells to temporarily grant them the same cloud-walking abilities as their feathered brethren.\n\nBefore and during the Great War, Cloudsdale was one of the primary weather producers of Equestria, its weather factory churning out various clouds, rainbows, rain, ice, sleet, snow, and anything else that could be described and requested by the weather teams in ground cities across the country. Additionally, Cloudsdale was the center of pegasi culture and politics, tracing its heritage back to the earliest days of the §YThree Tribes§!, when it was a military citizen's republic. Every year, Cloudsdale was the host of the §3Best Young Fliers competition§!, where the fastest and most talented pegasi youth raced to determine who was the most able of their age bracket. This tradition dated back to the time of their heroes, such as Commander Hurricane. The Ministry Mare and Element of Loyalty, §CRainbow Dash§!, was the undisputed champion of her time before she moved away from Cloudsdale.\n\nAs the pegasi had a military background, they contributed much to the war effort in terms of personnel and tactics. After the §OShadowbolts§! were formed by Rainbow Dash, pegasi were front and center in Equestrian life as symbols of pony the tenacity of ponies against the zebra menace and heroes to aspire to be for fillies and colts everywhere.\n\nFor Cloudsdale, the prestige seemed to last a lifetime, until the §RLast Day§!. As a major contributor the war against the zebras and one of the premier cities of Equestria, it was chosen as the first location to be hit by a §7megaspell§!. As there was little warning, only a hoofful of ponies escaped before its populace and many of its critical structures were vaporized in a single blast. What remained of the city, bereft of much of the magic that kept it aloft, crashed to the ground, with most of the remaining cloud infrastructure dispersing as nothing more than mist, and the few harder structures crumbling and collapsing into unrecognizable husks. Of the citizens that survived, some were turned into §Lghouls§! with most turning feral and lingering around their home.\n\nToday, the proud city is nothing more than some piles of cloudy rubble and a walking graveyard. The remnants of the weather factory have leaked magical byproducts from the creation of rainbows into the ground, mixing with the lingering §7balefire radiation§! to occasionally whip up storms that can flay the skin off anycreature foolish enough to venture into its depths. Yet there is still a charm to it, as if glimpsing an image through a shattered telescope at the glory days of the Equestria of yore."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_550:0 "At the heart of §Y[LIT.GetNameDef]§! territory lies the remains of one of the wonders of the pre-war Equestria. Through mettle and grit, they have reactivated one §CCloudsdale's§! original weather factories, although it is no longer used for that purpose. Where its cloud assembly lines were used to create all manner of weather patterns, ranging from snowflakes to hail, cumulus to cirrus clouds, it now manufactures assorted weapons and civilian goods.\n\nAlthough it was the first factory, it was not the last, as §Y[LIT.GetNameDef]§! repaired others used in Cloudsdale, even braving some of the city's ruins for surviving equipment or schematics to construct their own copies. This has led to the land surrounding the weather factory to be comprised of industrial parks, albeit in a poor imitation of the pre-war way of industry. Where the smokestacks of Fillydelphia §Lbelch black, carbonous smoke§!, the relatively clean byproducts of the weather factory and its paraphernalia drift harmlessly into the air to disperse amongst the clouds.\n\nWith the focus on industrial goods, it remains a curiosity that the rainbow generator is still running and providing a de facto river that runs through the settlement surrounding the factories. In truth, there is no secret need for it to work, it is simply because §Y[LIT.GetNameDef]§! have not determined how to turn it off, and why would they bother? Many have voiced their opinion that it looks pretty. The rainbow is harmless enough to boot. In the surrounding area, anyway. It does, however, run all the way down to the §YCloudsdale Ruins§!, where the remaining §7balefire radiation§! has mixed with the soaked ground of the artificial drainage basin, and can be seen from time to time generating explosive storms that peter out before arriving in more populous settlements."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_538:0 "In the center of §YFillydelphia§!, the metal canyon of its downtown core still whispers with the ghosts of advanced industry and the march of steeled hooves, while echoing with the lost dreams and nightmares of a populace wiped out in an instant. Compared to the outskirts and industrial parks of Fillydelphia, the downtown core is like another world, with half-crumbled skyscrapers and skeletal towers the norm, and the bodies of the dead still littering the streets in their final moments before §7balefire§! descended from the heavens.\n\nBefore and during the Great War, the downtown core of Fillydelphia was more a corporate hub than industrial park. Many of the corporations that ruled Equestrian life in the last years had branch offices there, if not their headquarters. It was not uncommon to see representatives of §6Robronco§! in one cafe chatting with employees of one of the different weapons manufacturers, or a government official meeting with §YStable-Tec§! to discuss further integration with everyday pony life. These and dozens more held sway over the heart of the city, where the chatter of life flitted around the squeals and honks of cars. It was a life that felt like it would never end, and a symbol of prosperity that was never marred by the losses and deaths in the Great War.\n\nThat was until the bombs fell.\n\nIn an instant, much of the vibrancy of the downtown was snuffed out. Corporate offices were destroyed, and the lives of thousands were ended in the blink of an eye. One of the surviving structures was §CStable-Tec HQ§!, which was built just outside the core, along the shoreline of §YEclipse Gulf§!. While there was nothing particularly special about its construction, given that it was chosen by Stable-Tec's chief architect, §PApple Bloom§!, it was simply ensured to have been built right. As part of its role as the headquarters of Stable-Tec, it held the first Stable to be designed, §GStable 0§!. While it was not a full-fledged Stable, it showcased to investors and government officials that shelters could be used to protect the populace in the worst case scenario.\n\nAfter the bombs fell, the building was largely abandoned, with only some raider gangs making it their bases from time to time. Not until §CBlueberry Sabre§! led an attack with her Steel Rangers did it come under permanent, steadfast control. Since then, it has become the headquarters of the §CFillydelphian Contingent§!, and is a fortress that dominates the region. To gain entrance would require breaching either the reinforced courtyard walls or attacking directly through the gate, which is constructed from a battleship hull. Either option would be suicide. The Rangers know this.\n\nFrom their place of safety, the Fillydelphia Contingent trains its initiates and keeps a close watch on the Wasteland, especially their new neighbor, §RRed Eye§!. However, their defenses, while extensive, are not unassailable. With enough numbers, it could fall, and then the battle for another scrap of the Old World would simply begin again."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_234:0 "From the earliest days of §YPrincess Celestia's§! sole reign, the city of §CCanterlot§! had been the heart of Equestrian government, the pulse of §GHarmony§!, and the beacon of pony kindness and friendship the world over. Situated on the the end of the §YCanterhorn Mountain Range§!, the city was founded by unicorns hundreds of years before §2Princess Luna's§! banishment, as evident by the still standing, but certainly crumbling supports carrying distinctive enchantment symbols to help support the heavy, jutting platform. Although now empty, the harrowed and hallowed halls of the various buildings still carry a luster that is unmatched anywhere else in the Wasteland.\n\nAfter Luna was banished, Princess Celestia made Canterlot her new home and castle after agreements with the unicorns at the time. Within a century, the city had cemented itself as the prominent settlement of the land, as not one decision for running the country was made without passing through it. Celestia was claimed to have frequently spoken with her subjects directly, and the tradition of the §8Day Court§! was soon established so that any and all who had problems could see them addressed by their benevolent ruler. In time, the peace that was fostered in the courts propagated through Equestria, and the brilliant marble and gilded roofs of some of the most vital establishments of Equestria became a symbol of Equestrian hegemony.\n\nInstitutions like §tCelestia's School for Gifted Unicorns§! became talk of all in Equestria. To receive invitation to any one of the ultra-elite establishments was to be seen as blessed by the Princess herself. In Canterlot, culture thrived like no other, with many fashion trends originating among the aristocracy before filtering its way down to the common masses, who ultimately made it too blasé to be used further. Every year, the §YGrand Galloping Gala§! was a highlight, where anypony who was anypony wished to directly gain the Princess's ear, or to show that they, too, were worthy of recognition among the unicorn upper crust. Likewise, the §OSummer Sun Celebration§! originated in Canterlot, although it soon was a holiday that saw Celestia travel Equestria each year to a different settlement to see her ponies and wish them all well.\n\nHowever, the Canterlot of today is but a hollow shell of that life and vibrancy. During the War, it became the seat of the six ministries that shaped so much of Equestrian life either directly or from the shadows of society. Numerous pre-war corporations either had their headquarters there or branch offices, so that they could keep their interests visible to first Princess Celestia, and after her abdication, Princess Luna. As the city itself was distant from the fighting on Equus, it was believed safe, especially with the alicorns to protect their ponies.\n\nYet that complacency allowed one of the greatest tragedies of the §RLast Day§!. When §7balefire bombs§! crossed the skies, many of them took direct aim at Canterlot as an obvious attempt to kill the Princesses and decapitate the Equestrian government. As both Celestia and Luna were in the city, they rallied to the defense and prevented the bombs from impacting, but that only played into the zebras' plan. An infiltrator unleashed the §PPink Cloud§!, a toxin designed to kill even the hardiest of ponies, like alicorns. The shield held the cloud until it was too late: an entire metropolis, killed at the hooves of their leaders.\n\nNow, Canterlot is nothing but an empty graveyard. Its north section is what most ponies think of when they hear its name, as it still contains the old castle grounds, the ministry plaza, and various other cultural sights. If one were to somehow walk the storied streets without succumbing to the §PPink Cloud§! that consumes the city, one would see cafes, restaurants, theaters, and other reminders of the culture that once thrived here. §tMinistry Plaza§! itself still maintains a terrifying visage of the different ministries, and there are doubtless untold treasures that can be claimed from them.\n\nVenturing into the city is not for the faint of heart, as the §PPink Cloud§! is still so concentrated, it can kill a pony on contact. It would be foolhardy to even consider going inside, but for those who wish to see the Old World in an eerie, preserved majesty, that is only way it can be done.\n\nJust don't let your first breath in Canterlot be your §Rlast§!."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_180:0 "To the south of the grand promenades of central and north §YCanterlot§!, the simple and mundane suburbs of the city stretch on for hours. Although none of the inhabitants who once lived there were high-ranking or important members of Equestrian society, they, like their Princesses, were condemned by the zebras upon the launch of their §7balefire bombs§! and the infiltration that ultimately unleashed the §PPink Cloud§! upon the city. South Canterlot, like the northern section, is covered in a permanent haze of the poison, which drapes and clings to every building like a fungus.\n\nYet there is life, in a way, among the almost certain death that awaits any who travel in the billows of zebra necromancy. Enclosed within the §PPink Cloud§! there lies a lone town, one which has been part of the city since its destruction. §CStable City§!, so called due to it being built around the location of §YStable 1§!, is a port of safety in the otherwise hostile ruins of Canterlot. However, few willingly go there, unless they are already dead, as the city itself is nothing more than a §Lnecropolis§! in the literal sense of the word.\n\nStable 1 itself is a different beast, as like the other Stables, it was ostensibly designed to protect its inhabitants and keep them locked up until it was once more safe to travel along the surface. Yet that was not the true intention of this stable. As punishment for their crimes of fueling the War, Stable 1 originally was to remained sealed for all eternity, forever trapping the aristocracy, corporatists, ministry mares, and even the Princesses themselves, so they could languish in guilt. Yet that mission was never carried out, as the Princesses died protecting Canterlot and the ministry mares never went to that stable. Some of the Canterlot elite were trapped, but they too, were able to one day escape.\n\nThat was into another certain doom, though, as the only reason the stable's door was able to be unsealed was due to a malfunction. The cause of that, as those that remember the day say, was because of the §PPink Cloud§! eating its way through the stable door itself. In a few hours, the entire stable was flooded with the toxin, and most of the populace died. Those few that could get to environmentally sealed suits escaped, but most perished in agony.\n\nThen they got up again.\n\nA number of the residents, instead of succumbing to the §PCloud§!, were instead transformed into ghouls. In the decades since the breaching of Stable 1, they have established a larger settlement around its exterior, and left the husk of the vault mostly empty, save for whenever they need to salvage something. Due to their ranks containing a number of high-class ponies from before the war, they remain wary of outsiders, but for anypony brave enough to wander there, they will at least keep them stocked up on ammo and supplies.\n\nSometimes, after all, the dead wish to be left in peace."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_596:0 "Welcome to one of the finest, premier, high-tooting settlements of the §YMild West§!! Now enjoy the stay for the §Rrest of your life§!, or until you're sold.\n\nIf that's something you want to hear, then make a stop in §CAppleloosa§!, or as more and more are calling it, §COld Appleloosa§!. The town can directly trace its founding to the waves of settlers that slowly encroached upon the south-western desert, in search of new land to claim for Harmony and to plant new farms to feed the hungry nation. Appleloosa was not overly special, and was simply another one of the settler towns that sprung up at the turn of the millennium.\n\nAs its land was quite fertile for the arid region, with a little bit of earth pony magic, it soon was home to hundreds of apple trees by which the town earned its name. Although the town didn't have much, it was another idyllic home for ponies to travel to, no matter where they came from in Equestria. The sheriff's office was more a formality than necessity, since the little town still knew everypony by name. Most of the time it was common to see the office closed down, with the sheriff either making rounds chatting with citizens or meeting at the local saloon, the §YSalt Block§!, to discuss the happenings in and around Appleloosa.\n\nOther sights included a clock tower that later was claimed to have been erected in one week—it was not—and a small stage, called the §YSwinging Spotlight§!, to be used for open-air musical performances and dances, a staple of the Mild West.\n\nIn its time, there was a small disturbance with the local buffalo known later in the history books as the §RApple War§!, but it was peacefully resolved thanks to the intervention of the §PMinistry Mares§! and quick thinking by a buffalo and one or two residents. This compromise lasted until the end of the Great War, when desperation on the part of the buffalo meant that the truce had to be called off. For months, the land of Appleloosa was less irradiated than locations closer to Equestria, and the town struggled to protect it from groups of raiders.\n\nYet evenetually, the radiation from Las Pegasus and nearby Rockville drifted south, and the apple orchards began to wither and die. Now only a few sickly stumps are all that's left of the vivid and vibrant pride of the town. For a while, it lay abandoned before raider bands dispelled by survivors in Rockville fortified it, and in exchange for food and money, provided access to their captives, no matter the age, sex, or species of prisoner. Through agreements with §CNew Appleloosa§! only a few hours away, transport was facilitated for any prospective clients.\n\nWhat little there is that remains of the town has been twisted into a caricature of what life in the Mild West was once like. Slavers and raiders sometimes brawl in the streets, as long as local order is otherwise preserved, and cages and pens dominate the landscape. The clock tower itself, although decrepit, still keeps time, but has also been turned into a tower from which to survey the entire town, to ensure that any slaves who get ideas of freedom are quickly dealt with.\n\nAs a reflection of harshness of the Wasteland, it is advised the average traveler avoids Old Appleloosa at all costs, unless one has the caps for buying a slave or two. Even then, don't always believe that you'll make it out without a collar around your neck."

Although it appears to be, as the citizens themselves say, a little on the rustic side from the exterior, inside, one is greeted by some of the nicest and friendliest ponies this side of §YFriendship City§!. For many visitors, it's been claimed to be extremely off-putting, especially since there are always the raiders and bandits around the town to worry about.\n\nLike many settlements in the Wasteland, Arbu didn't exist before the War. Although technically a subdivision in §YManehattan§!, there was no defining feature that denoted when somepony entered and when somepony left. It was just another stretch of roads and houses, where ponies could meet with neighbors, gossip, and keep up with the Appleses. What little is shared by the current residents of Arbu indicates that their founders discovered the subdivision mostly undamaged, and went quickly from there to make it as safe as possible.\n\nGiven its proximity to the coast, the town relies mostly on trading the meat of §Gradigators§!, which has made them popular enough with griffons and other carnivorous creatures, as well as the occasional pony who must relent to the unappealing call for sustenance while on an empty stomach. Inside the town itself, there are some of the usual suspects. It has a small office for its mayor, a clinic, and a couple of bars. Nothing is too out of the ordinary, save the extreme friendliness of the ponies living therein.\n\nHowever, since it is near only irradiated water, the citizens tend to be exposed to more than is healthy, and have at times petitioned the nearby §CSteel Rangers§! for some of their water, in exchange for either radigator meat or hides. While it has always been turned down by the Rangers, it has not deterred them. To this day, the radigator hunt is a right of passage for the youngest of ponies there. According to locals, an adult or two watches the young filly or colt who wishes to become part of society as they stalk their first prey and subdue it with only minimal weaponry. After that, it is the time-honored activity of flaying and carving the radigator that they must do alone, then cook a delicious stew or soup with it to serve to the rest of the community.\n\nIf accepted, then they may eat the §Rheart§! of their first prey, thereby signifying that they have fully embraced the way of the hunt, and can be treated as an equal with the other citizens of town. For their efforts, they receive a brand on their flanks, to tell the world and the town that they have bravely fought and bested a radigator on their own.\n\nThere have been complaints of some of the food making pony visitors ill, however, the town says it's merely because they were herbivorous and not used to eating large quantities of meat. The town is perfectly safe, and friendly, as they love to remind any and everycreature who stops by."
