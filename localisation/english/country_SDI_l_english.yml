shadowdisciple.1.t:0 "Dreams and Scrap"
shadowdisciple.1.d:0 "WIP\n\nExplains the basics of the Scrapper Syndicate and the Disciples of the Balefire Shadows factions and what they are seeking in Princessyn. Umbral Zap, a dashite, is the leader of the Disciples, and obsessed with the the Balefire shadows left behind from the bombs in Severyana, due to it's interaction with the Zone. He used to work for the Scrapper Syndicate before founding his current cult. The Syndicate was convinced by Zap to fund this expedition with a promise of unimaginable wealth, and a political territory of their own. The Syndicate is a large organization operating throughout Severyana and parts of northern Equestria, functioning like a sort of union for Scrappers and Salvagers to negotiate large scale contracts with cities and nations. They are pretty de-centralized, and lack any real political influence, but have a lot of money to throw around. The Syndicate has also hired a contingent of Talons from the Blackwater Coalition to support the expedition."
shadowdisciple.1.a:0 "Let's hope this doesn't fall apart..."

shadowdisciple.2.t:0 "Scrapyard Scrap"
shadowdisciple.2.d:0 "WIP\n\nA group of Talons and a small unit of Disciples got into a fight while trying to secure an advanced energy rifle that a Syndicate slavager had recently discovered. Luckily, no-creature died, though a lot of bruises, black eyes, broken bones and at least one bite-wound that needed a healing potion, were logged. Captain Gulda of the Talons is demanding the offending Disciples be tried for assault, claiming ehr Talons ahd already paid for the weapon when the Disciples arrived. Umbral Zap of the Disciples claims that the Talons seizing the gun is in violation of their contract, which speciefies what type of loot they are allowed to freely take. Forepony Testy Toaster of the Syndicate will have to decide which of them to side with on this relatively minor issue."
shadowdisciple.2.a:0 "Side with the Disciples"
shadowdisciple.2.b:0 "Side with the Talons"

shadowdisciple.3.t:0 "Command Consolidation"
shadowdisciple.3.d:0 "WIP\n\nCaptain Gulda of the Blackwater Talons has begun a major effort to streamline their command structure, and centralize military command around herself. Currently lerge elements of the Talons operate as little more than raiders under our Flag, more interested in pressing the locals for caps than actually fighting. While it is always risky to give military leaders more authority, in this case it might very well be warranted, if we want to improve our combat performance, and stop civilians being robbed."
shadowdisciple.3.a:0 "Allow the Consolidation"
shadowdisciple.3.b:0 "Prevent the Consolidation"

shadowdisciple.4.t:0 "Shadowchasers"
shadowdisciple.4.d:0 "WIP\n\nAfter some exploration, members of the Disciples report having seen groups of Balefire Shadows acting uncharacteristically passive, often ignoring even direct contact. Umbral Zap and his priests have seized on this as a sign of favour from the shadows, and are pouring copious amounts of our resources into trying to establish a way to communicate with the shadows, in addition to building small shrines to them all over our territory. With the Disciples so busy chasing their gods, many of their administrative and guard duties will need to be temporarily filled by either the Talons or the Syndicate... Which one do we choose?"
shadowdisciple.4.a:0 "The Talons can fill the role"
shadowdisciple.4.b:0 "Let the Syndicate handle it"

shadowdisciple.5.t:0 "Renenwed Negotiations"
shadowdisciple.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nRepresentatives from Blackwater have approached us to re-negotiate their contract. Blackwater Central command seems more than satisfied with our current rate of progress in the expedition, and is in fact offering to expand the contract. This would allow us to recruit additional Talons, and Blackwater would send us a dedicated Corps of Drill-seargants and recruitment officers. Of course, this expanded contract would be a fair bit more expensive than our current one, but it might be worth it..."
shadowdisciple.5.a:0 "Keep our current Contract"
shadowdisciple.5.b:0 "Expand the Contract"

shadowdisciple.6.t:0 "Call of the Dark"
shadowdisciple.6.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Disciples have been spending a truly concerning amount on their 'research' of the Balefire shadows, as well as building small shrines and proseletyzing the locals. Now, Umbral Zap has requested an even bigger package of caps and equipment be devoted to the Disciples, though the Syndicate and Talons ahve blocked it for now. Denying it would likely lead to more internal division as Zap would undoubtedly undermine our authority as revenge. Allowing it on the other hoof is likely to hamper the war effort, as even more resources are dedicated towards the Disciples' projects."
shadowdisciple.6.a:0 "Block the Package"
shadowdisciple.6.b:0 "Allow the funding"

shadowdisciple.7.t:0 "Black Letters"
shadowdisciple.7.d:0 "WIP\n\n[BLA.GetLeader] has sent one of the famed Black letters. In the deep of night, a group of Blackwater operatives entered Princessyn by wing and made their way to the local Talon Headquaters. A Black letter can mean only one thing: That Blackwater wants us to break our current contract and betray our employers to benefit the Company as a whole. Captain Gulda does not like the idea, as it completely goes agains the code of honor most Talons hold to. As she reads the letter, she gets increasingly astounded, as her orders are not only to betray her employers, but to Seize the city of Princessyn in the Name of Blackwater and found a new subsidiary Talon company that will support Blackwater operations throughout Severyana. Gulda is heavily playing with the idea of ordering her guards to simply capture the Operatives, destroy the letter and pretend it never arrived..."
shadowdisciple.7.a:0 "The Operatives and Letter are quietly 'disappeared'"
shadowdisciple.7.b:0 "Captain Gulda prepares herself for this new mission"

shadowdisciple.8.t:0 "Bending binary wills"
shadowdisciple.8.d:0 "WIP\n\nWe have managed to seize the Administration tower, and with it one of the most powerful AIs still active in the wasteland. Sadly, it is also utterly hostile to our intentions. Syndicate Engineers end up giving the Ai the computer-qeuivalent of a lobotomy, leaving it much less capable, but also utterly loyal to us. On the plus side, our expertise in salvaging has led us to recover a number of databanks with blueprints for Robots, as well as the re-activation of a room sized 3d-printer capable of creating complex machinery"
shadowdisciple.8.a:0 "This city is a den of Wonders"

shadowdisciple.9.t:0 "Unusual Recruits"
shadowdisciple.9.d:0 "WIP\n\nWith the recent defeat of Punt and their Red Stalkers raider-gang, we are short one competitor for Princessyn. However, Captain Gulda and her Talons seem to have picked up a sizable chunk of the more proffessional Raiders and seem intent on integrating them into Talon forces. This would surely strengthen our military, but is also a bad look, and would give GUlda even more political influence."
shadowdisciple.9.a:0 "Allow her to recruit Raiders"
shadowdisciple.9.b:0 "Ban Raider-recruitment"

shadowdisciple.10.t:0 "Salvage-Assessment: Princessyn"
shadowdisciple.10.d:0 "WIP\n\nA salvage report by Syndicate Scavengers and engineers, trying to give a rough asessment of the amount of raw salvage and technology that is available. It is an enourmous amount, with a major metropolis so relatively untouched, Princessyn alone could more than triple the Syndicates profits if they manage to fully seize the City."
shadowdisciple.10.a:0 "A worthwhile investment"

shadowdisciple.11.t:0 "Communion with the Apocalypse"
shadowdisciple.11.d:0 "WIP\n\nEvent to give the player a deeper look into the motivations of the Disciples. Umbral Zap was marked a Dashite from the Skyfreeze Enclave for his insistence on studying ghouls and the remnants of ponies exposed to balefire radiation. For this, he illegally ventured to the surface (this was before Skyfreeze came down) multiple times, and was eventually caught. He, and the disciples, believe that the Balefire bombs have trapped the souls of all the creatures that were killed by them, and that ghouls are the result of particulately sticky souls refusing to vacate their bodies. Essentially, they want to release the Shadows from their perceived suffering, either by releasing them intot he beyond, or by finding some way to give them new bodies. The cult exalts wartime equestria as a time of plenty and might, and sees the Princesses as an ascendant goal to strive towards (were they located further south, they might well have joined RedEye in his quest of new ALicorns). In Princessyn, they intend to study the untouched ruins, and massive amount of Balefire shadows and feral ghouls to further their goals of communion with the shadows."
shadowdisciple.11.a:0 "Let's save our gods!"

shadowdisciple.12.t:0 "Annales Umbra"
shadowdisciple.12.d:0 "WIP\n\nShort event that describes that Umbral Zap, in a fugue state after consuming copious amounts of hallucinogens, writing a dozen or so pages of 'prophecy'that he Calls the Annales Umbra. He proclaims the shadows spoke to him and told him of his destiny. He is to be the saviour of ponykind, and will defeat death itself. If he succeeds, all the dead shall be resurected and given new, immortal bodies to join with the living, or so he claims. The Talons and Syndicate look at this proclamation with a mix of bemusement and worry, but the Disciples take it as fact, and celebrate this revelation"
shadowdisciple.12.a:0 "Prophecies, eh?"

shadowdisciple.13.t:0 "A Lasting Presence"
shadowdisciple.13.d:0 "WIP\n\n§r|Disciple Victory|§! Princessyn has been seized by the Expediton.\nWhile celebrations where ongoing, the Disciples of the Balefire Shadows covertly moved to arrest prominent leaders of the Syndicate, and put Captain Gulda under house arrest. Whent he next dawn rose, the Disciples where in de-facto lone control of Princessyn. However, their hold is strenuous, and they can't flat out kick the Talons and Syndicate out of the country. For now, they are merely suppressing their power, and trying to use them for all they are worth. Now, Umbral Zap finally has the resources to research Balefire phenomena, and maybe even find a way to give form to the Shadows"
shadowdisciple.13.a:0 "Victory for the Faithful"

shadowdisciple.14.t:0 "A Lasting Presence"
shadowdisciple.14.d:0 "WIP\n\n§O|Syndicate Victory|§! Princessyn has been seized by the Expediton.\nIn the black of night, a large Syndicate force entered the city, and promptly secured most major points with little resistance. The Syndicate Council has decided to relocate their main operations to the city, and make it it's official seat of power. Violence was contained, as only a scant few cultists were awake or sober enough to resist, while the Talons were generously paid off. Umbral Zap has been captured, and is currently being held in the new Syndicate HQ. The Disciples seem paralyzed without their leader, and will likely only pose a minor threat to our new regime. Captain Gulda has congratulated us on our victory, with Blackwater sending a transmission, reaffirming our alliance and contract. With Princessyn seized, the Syndicate can properly embark on it's mission to become even more fabously wealthy, and start and era of peace and trade in Severyana."
shadowdisciple.14.a:0 "Peace under the Syndicate"

shadowdisciple.15.t:0 "A Lasting Presence"
shadowdisciple.15.d:0 "WIP\n\n§F|Talon Victory|§! Princessyn has been seized by the Expediton.\nIn a surprising upturn, Talon operatives started this morning with a series of political assassinations and bombings. Among the dead are Umbral Zap and many of his inner circle, as well as several of the more 'inconvenient' members of the Syndicate. Barracks and shrines were bombed, and the military and Cult are in disarray. Only an hour later, Captain Gulda announces herself over the radia, claiming the title of Interim Administrator of Princessyn. After more hours of tense negotiations, the Syndicate and Blackwater negotiate a new deal, this time much more favourable to Blackwater. While it is unspoken, everycreature knows that Princessyn has just become a Protectorate under Blackwater. What the future holds is uncertain, but the Cult will most certainly retaliate for the deaths of their leaders."
shadowdisciple.15.a:0 "The Talons bring order"
