shadowdisciple.1.t:0 "Dreams and Scrap"
shadowdisciple.1.d:0 "WIP\n\nExplains the basics of the Scrapper Syndicate and the Disciples of the Balefire Shadows factions and what they are seeking in Princessyn. Umbral Zap, a dashite, is the leader of the Disciples, and obsessed with the the Balefire shadows left behind from the bombs in Severyana, due to it's interaction with the Zone. He used to work for the Scrapper Syndicate before founding his current cult. The Syndicate was convinced by Zap to fund this expedition with a promise of unimaginable wealth, and a political territory of their own. The Syndicate is a large organization operating throughout Severyana and parts of northern Equestria, functioning like a sort of union for Scrappers and Salvagers to negotiate large scale contracts with cities and nations. They are pretty de-centralized, and lack any real political influence, but have a lot of money to throw around. The Syndicate has also hired a contingent of Talons from the Blackwater Coalition to support the expedition."
shadowdisciple.1.a:0 "Let's hope this doesn't fall apart..."

shadowdisciple.2.t:0 "Scrapyard Scrap"

Luckily, no-creature died, though a lot of bruises, black eyes, broken bones and at least one bite-wound that needed a healing potion, were logged. Captain Gulda of the Talons is demanding the offending Disciples be tried for assault, claiming ehr Talons ahd already paid for the weapon when the Disciples arrived. Umbral Zap of the Disciples claims that the Talons seizing the gun is in violation of their contract, which speciefies what type of loot they are allowed to freely take. Forepony Testy Toaster of the Syndicate will have to decide which of them to side with on this relatively minor issue."
