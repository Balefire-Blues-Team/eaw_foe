goldendawnrevolt.1.d:0 "WIP\nThe Golden Dawn and their allies are now in open war with the Yak Forces. Due to clever deception, and the replacement of some Yak commanders, there are a decent number of very confused Yaks fighting for our Side as well. In the City of Morningstar, the Golden Dawn has eastablished their base of Operations. They are now spending every favour and Cap they have acquired, hiring Mercs, buying foreign guns and offering large benefits for Conscripts."

goldendawnrevolt.2.t:0 "The War in Heaven"
goldendawnrevolt.2.d:0 "This event describes the Conflict between Celestia and NMM in biblical sort of way, and how it was the trial of darkness. Celestia is not a goddess herself, but an avatar of the Golden Sun."

goldendawnrevolt.3.t:0 "Peace in the land of God"

Dawnlight gives a speech over radio to the ponies of the realm, promising peace and prosperity under his new regime. Quietly, agents of the Golden Dawn are making lists of potential dissenters and earmarking certain individuals to be liquidated later on."
goldendawnrevolt.3.a:0 "The Sun shines on Equestria... metaphorically."
