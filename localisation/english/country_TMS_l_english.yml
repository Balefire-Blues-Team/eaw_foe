 ###Events###
 
goldendawnrevolt.1.t:0 "Heed the Call"
goldendawnrevolt.1.d:0 "WIP\nThe Golden Dawn and their allies are now in open war with the Yak Forces. Due to clever deception, and the replacement of some Yak commanders, there are a decent number of very confused Yaks fighting for our Side as well. In the City of Morningstar, the Golden Dawn has eastablished their base of Operations. They are now spending every favour and Cap they have acquired, hiring Mercs, buying foreign guns and offering large benefits for Conscripts."
goldendawnrevolt.1.a:0 "Onwards, soldiers of heaven"

goldendawnrevolt.2.t:0 "The War in Heaven"
goldendawnrevolt.2.d:0 "This event describes the Conflict between Celestia and NMM in biblical sort of way, and how it was the trial of darkness. Celestia is not a goddess herself, but an avatar of the Golden Sun."
goldendawnrevolt.2.a:0 "Thus, the first trial Concluded"

goldendawnrevolt.3.t:0 "Peace in the land of God"
goldendawnrevolt.3.d:0 "The Yaks are defeated, and the Northern Liberation Front stands victorious. Dawnlight gives a speech over radio to the ponies of the realm, promising peace and prosperity under his new regime. Quietly, agents of the Golden Dawn are making lists of potential dissenters and earmarking certain individuals to be liquidated later on."
goldendawnrevolt.3.a:0 "The Sun shines on Equestria... metaphorically."

goldendawnrevolt.4.t:0 "Repentance before the Light"
goldendawnrevolt.4.d:0 "WIP\n\nSome of the Yaks that we have tricked to fight for us in the uprising have genuinely converted to the Dawnite Faith. Dawnlight decrees that they may find absolution for their crimes against Equus by serving faithfully in the armies of the Golden Dawn. He also proclaims that every race is welcome to join in the golden light, if they are willing to fight for the faith."
goldendawnrevolt.4.a:0 "For the Light!"

goldendawnrevolt.5.t:0 "Addressing the Faithful"
goldendawnrevolt.5.d:0 "WIP\nIn a grand ceremony, Dawnlight holds a mass before a massive crowd in morningstar, which is transmitted over Radio to the entire nation. Near the end of the sermon, an assassin tries to shoot Dawnlight with a Laser-Rifle. As the crowd tears the assassin apart with their bare hooves, Dawnlight falls, his assistants rushing to him.\nContinued in second event."
goldendawnrevolt.5.a:0 "Sir, are you OK?"

goldendawnrevolt.501.t:0 "The Eternal Prophet"
goldendawnrevolt.501.d:0 "A confused Dawnlight rises, only having sustained a light burn to his chest. He stops the ponies trying to calm the crowd, and instead begins to whip them up further, Claiming to have been saved by God, that he is God's eternal Prophet, and that this act of attempted Assassination proves their enemies aim for the destruction of the faith. Therefore it is paramount that the faith strikes out first, and destroys all who have been infected by the sin of this world."
goldendawnrevolt.501.a:0 "God is with us!"

goldendawnrevolt.6.t:0 "The Marketplace Massacre"
goldendawnrevolt.6.d:0 "WIP\n\nDawnite militias are roaming the streets of [Capital.GetName], destroying any symbols of the old order. The faithful are dragging the owners of gambling dens and brothels, as well as anyone engaging in apostate-professions out onto the streets and towards the central marketplace. The worst offenders are shot, and their bodies tossed onto a great pyre, while the lesser offenders are giving the choice between renouncing their entire wealth and way of life, becoming acolytes of the faith, or to be killed as well. The City will become a place of virtue, fit for the Eternal Prophet."
goldendawnrevolt.6.a:0 "A cleansed City, a clean People"

goldendawnrevolt.7.t:0 "The Mother of Invention"
goldendawnrevolt.7.d:0 "WIP\n\nBoiling Brew, master-alchemist and one of the members of the Council of Spring has joined the Dawnites. While she is far from a true believer, she still serves the Dawn, so long as the Society provides for her research. Recently, Brew has apporached Dawnlight with an unusual proposal. To resume the megaspell-program of Equestria, and work towards replicating the powers of old. As we lack Magical Crystals, we will find alternative sources of Energy though..."
goldendawnrevolt.7.a:0 "Authorize the Program"

goldendawnrevolt.8.t:0 "Let there be fire... §Nagain§!"
goldendawnrevolt.8.d:0 "Sirens blared throughout the labs.\n\nPonies were panicking, some running towards, or away from the fire, others having fallen to their knees and praying to their Golden Dawn for some sort of salvation.\nWhat a downgrade from the professionals in Limua this place was... Boiling Brew banished the thought from her mind. The Academy was no more, this was her life now, at least until... no, no reason to even think about it.\nBrew bit into one of the packets of Rad-Away and let the orange-flavoured liquid run down her throat.\nA Radiation-leak was no joke, but ponies tended to forget the myriad method old Equestria had developed to deal with such things. Ignoring the incoming headache from the Sirens, Brew began calling up the results from this latest test on her terminal. With every line, her eyes widened a bit more, the Rad-Away dropping to the floor, as she checked the number again in disbelief.\n\nHe had been right.\n\nSick Shine's theory on radiation-cascades was right!. Oh, if the old ghoul was still alive, he would be jumping with joy.\n\nBrew compiled the research, making sure to insert a few extra components.\nCouldn't move around these fanatics without a failsafe, and what better way to do that than a dead-man's switch for a second apocalypse?"
goldendawnrevolt.8.a:0 "Brew moved to present her findings to Dawnlight"

goldendawnrevolt.9.t:0 "The end of C.A.R.E."
goldendawnrevolt.9.d:0 "WIP\n\nOh god, Oh fuck, the crazy cultists have nukes now, Celestia Help us.\nUnder supervision of Boiling Brew and Dawnlight, Apocrypha conducts it's first successful Megaspell-test, detonating a Balefire-bomb over Alpha-Site. Dawnlight sees this as a clear sign that God is on their side, and they are now able to purge the land in divine Light. Boiling Brew is less Happy..."
goldendawnrevolt.9.a:0 "We have become the Angel of Death"

goldendawnrevolt.10.t:0 "Apocrypha achieves Balefire-Bombs"
goldendawnrevolt.10.d:0 "WIP\n\nNews-Event\n\nThe Golden Dawn Cult has achieved the construction of a new, fully functional Balefire Bomb, and tested it in their territory. Many wasteland powers are concerned, and worry that a new apocalypse is approaching, now that a bunch of crazy cultists possess such weaponry."
goldendawnrevolt.10.a:0 "Quite Concerning"





goldendawnrevolt.999.t:0 "The End of Suffering"
goldendawnrevolt.999.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Third Trial is complete, we are the only nation left on the Continent!"
goldendawnrevolt.999.a:0 "Neat"
