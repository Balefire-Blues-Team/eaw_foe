 talon_pa_tech:0 "Talon Power Armour"
 talon_pa_tech_desc:0 "Power armor based off of the old Ministry of Awesome designs, which has been adapted specifically for griffon use."

 knight_pa_tech:0 "Knight Power Armour"
 knight_pa_tech_desc:0 "Based on a pre-war design intended for the Equestrian Royal Guard, Knight PA is bulky, slow, and cumbersome, but provides unparalled protection for its user."
 
 raptor_tech:0 "Raptor Cloudship"
 raptor_tech_desc:0 "The Raptor-Class Cloudship was designed by the Ministry of Awesome during the Great War to provide ground support and deal with singular large aerial targets. This later purpose led to them being nicknamed 'dragon killers', as they gained a reputation for being used to counter Zebrican-aligned dragons. They achieve flight through cloud generators, which unfortunately leaves them vulnerable to weather related accidents."
 
 x01_pa_tech:0 "X01 Power Armour"
 x01_pa_tech_desc:0 "X01-Class power armour was designed towards the very end of the War by the Ministry of Awesome, in conjunction with the Ministry of Wartime Technology. Unlike the sleeker model designed prior with the aid of the Ministry of Image, the X01 model was designed with durability over mobility in mind. This made it unpopular among the pegasus soldiers. As a result, this armour wouldn't rise to popularity until the early days of the Enclave, when the greater protection it afforded became greatly desirable."
 
 x02_pa_tech:0 "X02 Power Armour"
 x02_pa_tech_desc:0 "The X02-Class power armour is far more closely related to the original pegasus power armour than the X01 model. As resources grew scarcer, the Enclave was forced to design a less resource-intensive armour. The end result was the X02 model, which was much sleeker and lighter than its predecessor."

 balloon_tech:0 "Ministry of Morale Balloon"
 balloon_tech_desc:0 "During the War, the Ministry of Morale designed hot air balloons that looked like Ministry Mare Pinkie Pie. These balloons were used for a large variety of purposes, from monitoring suspicious activity to transporting soldiers for a raid. Though their visage is more than a little unnerving, they allow us to both monitor our own skies and to perform aerial reconnaissance."
 
 MAS_driver_mag_rifle_tech:0 "MAG-X Supercharged Rifle"
 MAS_driver_mag_rifle_tech_desc:0 "The MAG-X Supercharged Rifle was an experimental arcane weapon developed during the War. The kinks have never been worked out, but it has proven itself to be more than capable of laying waste to our foes."

 alicorn_folder:0 "Alicorn Technologies"
 alicorn_folder_desc:0 "Technologies specific to the alicorn race."

 tech_alicorn_eq:0 "Alicorn Body"
 tech_alicorn_eq_desc:0 "The physical body of an alicorn. However, it is useless until a mind occupies it."
 
 air_alicorn_equipment:0 "Flying Alicorn"
 air_alicorn_equipment_desc:0 "An alicorn in flight. It's just having a good time. Don't disturb it."

 foe_special_folder_desc:0 "Special technologies relating to various races and unique techs."
 
 category_special_units:0 "Special Units"

 ### Pony Techs
 TITLE_PONY_EP_SUBTITLE:0 "EARTH PONIES"

 tech_pony_foe_misc2:0 "Earth Pony Ingenuity"
 tech_pony_foe_misc2_desc:0 "Due to their inherent lack of magical manifestation, earth ponies have always had to push harder to innovate, especiallialy in the fields of arcane matrix technology such as robotics and computing."

 tech_pony_uni_misc:0 "Advanced Telekinesis"
 tech_pony_uni_misc_desc:0 "While every unicorn can use telekinesis, not every unicorn can use it to manipulate fine objects or carry many things at once. By starting widespread training programs to help our unicorns master this talent, we could increase their capabilities substantially."

 tech_pony_uni_misc2:0 "Matrix Repair"
 tech_pony_uni_misc2_desc:0 "Most spell matrices around today were made during the Great War. Needless to say, many of them have seen better days. By training specialists in the repair of these intricate arcane constructs, we should be able to restore and utilize many wartime technologies that were only good for scrapping before."

 tech_pony_uni_misc3:0 "Weapon Enchantment Talismans"
 tech_pony_uni_misc3_desc:0 "During the Great War, Equestria and Zebrica alike experimented with using enchantments to enhance their weaponry. Recoil elimination, ammunition enhancement, and increased durability were just a few of the many applications seen over the course of the War. By rediscovering how to cast these enchantments, we could similarly enhance our own weaponry."

 tech_pony_uni_misc4:0 "Magically Augmented Defense"
 tech_pony_uni_misc4_desc:0 "We could take our experiments into enchanting a step further by using this field to improve our own armour. Through the miracles of magic, we could allow our soldiers to carry three times their body weight as if it were nothing, or make them unnaturally resistant to hazards such as fire or acid."

 tech_pony_uni_misc5:0 "Rad Removal Spells"
 tech_pony_uni_misc5_desc:0 "Radiation is an ever-present threat in the Wasteland. Though precautions may be taken to limit exposure, and medicine may be used to purge it from ones system, we often don't know we're exposed to it before it's too late, and Rad-Away is rare. By developing spells that can be used to at least partially purge radiation, we could deal with surprise exposure far more effectively and reduce our reliance on wartime medication."

 ###Expanded Industry Tech###
 
 extraction_industry_tech_4_2:0 "Soundwave Extraction"
 extraction_industry_tech_4_2_desc:0 "Utilizing ground sonar to locate deposits in order to scout out scavenging sites will speed up the process a lot. Additionally, dedicated sound bays are able to use super-low frequencies to pulverize certain materials, while leaving others unharmed, making extraction childs play."
 
 construction_industry_tech_4_2:0 "Glass and Steel"
 construction_industry_tech_4_2_desc:0 "While certainly not the most aesthetically pleasing, we have an abundance of steel, and glass is pretty simple to manufacture. Not being reliant on time-consuming bricks will certainly make construction easier, but this should only be a temporary solution until we come up with some less labour-intensive methods."
 
 habitation_industry_tech_4_2:0 "Military Construction"
 habitation_industry_tech_4_2_desc:0 "During the Great War, the Ministry of Wartime Technology worked in conjunction with the Ministry of Peace to design temporary housing complexes, which could be used to house soldier and civilian alike. While they were not the most comfortable of living spaces, the ease in which they could be built made them fulfill their purpose exceptionally well. We will study their methods and modify them to be of use in our own projects."
 
 maketool_engineering_7:0 "Arcano-Mechanical Tools"
 maketool_engineering_7_desc:0 "Powered tools are nice, but what about tools that do most of the work by themselves? These arcano-mechanical constructs dynamically adapt themselves to whatever situation they encounter, changing size, shape and hardness as needed. This advancement would allow a single universal tool to fulfill the tasks we'd need a dozen others for before."
 
 universal_industry_tech_cap:0 "Atomic Rearrangement Process"
 universal_industry_tech_cap_desc:0 "By using extremely advanced spell-matrices and ludicrous amounts of energy, we are able to literally rearrange objects on the atomic scale, transumuting base elements into one another like lesser civilizations thought impossible before. Truly this is the cutting edge of production technology."

 extraction_industry_tech_6:0 "Matrix Powered Alchemy"
 extraction_industry_tech_6_desc:0 "Utilizing the latest advances in spell-matrix research, we are able to pinpoint imperfections that arise as a result of our production and extraction processes. We may then use targeted alchemy to transmute the faults into usable material. No longer will a poorly forged piece of metal or a defunct circuitboard need to be thrown away!"

 construction_industry_tech_7:0 "Ether Materials"
 construction_industry_tech_7_desc:0 "Naturally, materials that are physically impossible in our world could theoretically be much more resilient and easier to work with than even our best composites. Using arcane reality-bending, combined with cutting-edge summoning spells, would allow us to literally pull such impossible materials from the Ether and into our world."

 agriculture_industry_tech_8:0 "Self-Improving Crops"
 agriculture_industry_tech_8_desc:0 "Through the miracles of unrestrained artificial intelligence, we believe it is entirely possible to create a crop that is both capable of adapting to any environment and fully self-improving. Some people express concerns regarding the potential dangers of such technology, but ending world hunger is more than worth the risk. After all, the odds of a 'crop singularity' occurring are extremely low."
