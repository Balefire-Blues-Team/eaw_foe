 talon_pa_tech:0 "Talon Power Armour"
 talon_pa_tech_desc:0 "Power armor based off of the old Ministry of Awesome designs, which has been adapted specifically for griffon use."

 knight_pa_tech:0 "Knight Power Armour"
 knight_pa_tech_desc:0 "Based on a pre-war design intended for the Equestrian Royal Guard, Knight PA is bulky, slow, and cumbersome, but provides unparalled protection for its user."
 
 raptor_tech:0 "Raptor Cloudship"
 raptor_tech_desc:0 "The Raptor-Class Cloudship was designed by the Ministry of Awesome during the Great War to provide ground support and deal with singular large aerial targets. This later purpose led to them being nicknamed 'dragon killers', as they gained a reputation for being used to counter Zebrican-aligned dragons. They achieve flight through cloud generators, which unfortunately leaves them vulnerable to weather related accidents."
 
 x01_pa_tech:0 "X01 Power Armour"
 x01_pa_tech_desc:0 "X01-Class power armour was designed towards the very end of the War by the Ministry of Awesome, in conjunction with the Ministry of Wartime Technology. Unlike the sleeker model designed prior with the aid of the Ministry of Image, the X01 model was designed with durability over mobility in mind. This made it unpopular among the pegasus soldiers. As a result, this armour wouldn't rise to popularity until the early days of the Enclave, when the greater protection it afforded became greatly desirable."
 
 x02_pa_tech:0 "X02 Power Armour"
 x02_pa_tech_desc:0 "The X02-Class power armour is far more closely related to the original pegasus power armour than the X01 model. As resources grew scarcer, the Enclave was forced to design a less resource-intensive armour. The end result was the X02 model, which was much sleeker and lighter than its predecessor."

 balloon_tech:0 "Ministry of Morale Balloon"
 balloon_tech_desc:0 "During the War, the Ministry of Morale designed hot air balloons that looked like Ministry Mare Pinkie Pie. These balloons were used for a large variety of purposes, from monitoring suspicious activity to transporting soldiers for a raid. Though their visage is more than a little unnerving, they allow us to both monitor our own skies and to perform aerial reconnaissance."
 
 MAS_driver_mag_rifle_tech:0 "MAG-X Supercharged Rifle"
 MAS_driver_mag_rifle_tech_desc:0 "The MAG-X Supercharged Rifle was an experimental arcane weapon developed during the War. The kinks have never been worked out, but it has proven itself to be more than capable of laying waste to our foes."

 ### Pony Techs
 TITLE_PONY_EP_SUBTITLE:0 "EARTH PONIES"

 tech_pony_foe_misc2:0 "Earth Pony Ingenuity"
 tech_pony_foe_misc2_desc:0 "Due to their inherent lack of magical manifestation, earth ponies have always had to push harder to innovate, especiallialy in the fields of arcane matrix technology such as robotics and computing."

 tech_pony_uni_misc:0 "Advanced Telekinesis"
 tech_pony_uni_misc_desc:0 "While every unicorn can use telekinesis, not every unicorn can use it to manipulate fine objects or carry many things at once. By starting widespread training programs to help our unicorns master this talent, we could increase their capabilities substantially."

 tech_pony_uni_misc2:0 "Matrix Repair"
 tech_pony_uni_misc2_desc:0 "Most spell matrices around today were made during the Great War. Needless to say, many of them have seen better days. By training specialists in the repair of these intricate arcane constructs, we should be able to restore and utilize many wartime technologies that were only good for scrapping before."

 tech_pony_uni_misc3:0 "Weapon Enchantment Talismans"
 tech_pony_uni_misc3_desc:0 "During the Great War, Equestria and Zebrica alike experimented with using enchantments to enhance their weaponry. Recoil elimination, ammunition enhancement, and increased durability were just a few of the many applications seen over the course of the War. By rediscovering how to cast these enchantments, we could similarly enhance our own weaponry."

 tech_pony_uni_misc4:0 "Magically Augmented Defense"
 tech_pony_uni_misc4_desc:0 "We could take our experiments into enchanting a step further by using this field to improve our own armour. Through the miracles of magic, we could allow our soldiers to carry three times their body weight as if it were nothing, or make them unnaturally resistant to hazards such as fire or acid."

 tech_pony_uni_misc5:0 "Rad Removal Spells"
 tech_pony_uni_misc5_desc:0 "Radiation is an ever-present threat in the Wasteland. Though precautions may be taken to limit exposure, and medicine may be used to purge it from ones system, we often don't know we're exposed to it before it's too late, and Rad-Away is rare. By developing spells that can be used to at least partially purge radiation, we could deal with surprise exposure far more effectively and reduce our reliance on wartime medication."

 ###Expanded Industry Tech###
 
 extraction_industry_tech_4_2:0 "Soundwave Extraction"
 extraction_industry_tech_4_2_desc:0 "Utilizing ground sonar to locate deposits in order to scout out scavenging sites will speed up the process a lot. Additionally, dedicated sound bays are able to use super-low frequencies to pulverize certain materials, while leaving others unharmed, making extraction childs play."
 
 construction_industry_tech_4_2:0 "Glass and Steel"
 construction_industry_tech_4_2_desc:0 "While certainly not the most aesthetically pleasing, we have an abundance of steel, and glass is pretty simple to manufacture. Not being reliant on time-consuming bricks will certainly make construction easier, but this should only be a temporary solution until we come up with some less labour-intensive methods."
 
 habitation_industry_tech_4_2:0 "Military Construction"
 habitation_industry_tech_4_2_desc:0 "During the Great War, the Ministry of Wartime Technology worked in conjunction with the Ministry of Peace to design temporary housing complexes, which could be used to house soldier and civilian alike. While they were not the most comfortable of living spaces, the ease in which they could be built made them fulfill their purpose exceptionally well. We will study their methods and modify them to be of use in our own projects."
 
 maketool_engineering_7:0 "Arcano-Mechanical Tools"
 maketool_engineering_7_desc:0 "Powered tools are nice, but what about tools that do most of the work by themselves? These arcano-mechanical constructs dynamically adapt themselves to whatever situation they encounter, changing size, shape and hardness as needed. This advancement would allow a single universal tool to fulfill the tasks we'd need a dozen others for before."
 
 universal_industry_tech_cap:0 "Atomic Rearrangement Process"
 universal_industry_tech_cap_desc:0 "By using extremely advanced spell-matrices and ludicrous amounts of energy, we are able to literally rearrange objects on the atomic scale, transumuting base elements into one another like lesser civilizations thought impossible before. Truly this is the cutting edge of production technology."

 extraction_industry_tech_6:0 "Matrix Powered Alchemy"
 extraction_industry_tech_6_desc:0 "Utilizing the latest advances in spell-matrix research, we are able to pinpoint imperfections that arise as a result of our production and extraction processes. We may then use targeted alchemy to transmute the faults into usable material. No longer will a poorly forged piece of metal or a defunct circuitboard need to be thrown away!"

 construction_industry_tech_7:0 "Ether Materials"
 construction_industry_tech_7_desc:0 "Naturally, materials that are physically impossible in our world could theoretically be much more resilient and easier to work with than even our best composites. Using arcane reality-bending, combined with cutting-edge summoning spells, would allow us to literally pull such impossible materials from the Ether and into our world."

 agriculture_industry_tech_8:0 "Self-Improving Crops"
 agriculture_industry_tech_8_desc:0 "Through the miracles of unrestrained artificial intelligence, we believe it is entirely possible to create a crop that is both capable of adapting to any environment and fully self-improving. Some people express concerns regarding the potential dangers of such technology, but ending world hunger is more than worth the risk. After all, the odds of a 'crop singularity' occurring are extremely low."

### Vehicles ###

  vehicle_restoration:0 "Vehicle Restoration"
  vehicle_restoration_desc:0 "Advanced study of powerpacks, vehicular infrastructure and a general improvement in restoration of those components will allow us to salvage, repair and refit powered vehicles to equip our infantry divisions with, which should considerably improve the effectiveness and speed of our army."

  motorbike_equipment_1:0 "Scrap Motorcycles"
  motorbike_equipment_1_desc:0 "Tubings and househould appliance-type engines have given us the opportunity for the development of motorized vehicles. While not suited to the wasteland, terrain and lacking in subtility, it should give our soldiers a noticeable increase in both tactical and strategical mobility"
  motorbike_equipment_2:0 "Salvaged Motorcycles"
  motorbike_equipment_2_desc:0 "A lightly armored housing to protect sensitive equipment and better filtration systems will let our motorcycle divisions ride in the wasteland terrain with close to no problem. Drivers weren't forgotten, and specialized anti-dust goggles, mouth covering and shock-resistant helmets as well as a high visibility shield will let them take full advantage of their newfound mobility."
  motorbike_equipment_3:0 "Wasteland Motorcycles"
  motorbike_equipment_3_desc:0 "A lightly armored housing to protect sensitive equipment and better filtration systems will let our motorcycle divisions ride in the wasteland terrain with close to no problem. Drivers weren't forgotten, and specialized anti-dust goggles, mouth covering and shock-resistant helmets as well as a high visibility shield will let them take full advantage of their newfound mobility."

  tires_vehicle_tech:0 "Tyre Profile"
  tires_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "By changing the pattern of our tyre's contact surface and adding improvised knobs, we can help our vehicles gain more traction on the sandy and rocky terrain of the desert wasteland, letting them access difficult terrains more easily and gain momentum faster."
  tires_vehicle_tech_1:0 "Rubber Refinement"
  tires_vehicle_tech_1_desc:0 "Particular care is to be taken to a multitude of factors for our rubber compounds, such as hardness, external profile, and grip on both the blasted wasteland desert and the new infrastructure we are trying to build. Complimented by thicker tire profile with bulletproof properties, it will allow all of our vehicles to have better speed both on and off road."

  car_equipment_1:0 "Salvaged Car"
  car_equipment_1_desc:0 "Wastelander vehicles are certainly not pretty, but like us they are tough and reliable. While the scrap metal bolted to the frame won't stop aimed rifle fire, it should still provide our troops with some measure of protection. And no one will complain about not being subjected to the horrible weather of the wasteland."
  car_equipment_2:0 "Wasteland Car"
  car_equipment_2_desc:0 "The addition of pre-war technology, like improved engines and simple optics combined with wastelander thinkering to replace overcomplicated parts makes it so we can push our motorized forces even harder. Tight maintenance schedules and increased driver training is in order to maintain our strategical mobility and reduce accident rate."
  car_equipment_3:0 "Military Car"
  car_equipment_3_desc:0 "Now that our engineering capabilities are at an almost pre-war level, we can upgrade our motorized divisions to boast faster, more reliable and well protected vehicles. New armor plating and engine thinkering combined with classic wasteland tactics should give us an edge over any other unit short of armored divisions."

  plating_vehicle_tech:0 "Plating Addon"
  plating_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Crude, yet effective, making use of the vast number of scrap metal found around the wasteland could reinforce key weak-points in the armor of our vehicles. Protection is increased but take care to keep in mind the weight increase too."
  bumper_vehicle_tech:0 "Impact Bumpers"
  bumper_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Specially-made cowcatchers and other such styles of ram will give our troops the opportunity to partake in some rather unconventional tactics. Expect both a new way to break fortified lines and a higher disobedience rate."
  gasoline_vehicle_tech:0 "Volatile Fuels"
  gasoline_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "It might be best to not question the addictive and mixtures dumped into our fuel supply, but it is indeed effective. Engine roars, and sometimes sadly a bit more than that. It might be best to avoid the maintenance bay for bit while our maintenance crew calm down."
  sealed_vehicle_tech:0 "Environment sealing"
  sealed_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Entirely sealed hull weldings with air filtration systems and humidification equipment provides our vehicle crew and mobile divisions with a clean, fresh, and revigorating atmosphere to fight and recover in. While this would decrease the speed of our vehicles from the increased power draw and weight, our troops would get back in the fight faster with such upgrades."
  armoured_vehicle_tech:0 "Armour reinforcement"
  armoured_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "While previous armor upgrades were done only at key critical weak-points to preserve weight, we now have the option to go all-in thanks to improved suspensions and shock absorbers. Treated armor plating and even simple composite armor should keep our motorized and mechanized divisions relevant on the modern battlefield"

  tracks_vehicle_tech:0 "Simple Tracks"
  tracks_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Simplified track links and suspension systems is a key element to mass manufacturing of tracked vehicles. Such improvements would reduce vehicle down time, maintenance difficulty and workforce requirement, increasing the general reliability of our tanks."
  tracks_vehicle_tech_1:0 "Return Rollers"
  tracks_vehicle_tech_1_desc:0 "The addition of return rollers to our propulsion system let us keep a constant track tension, leading to less friction between them and the armor plates as well as other propulsion components. Less track replacements and noise as well as reduced wear on the battlefield improves the reliability of our tracked vehicles."

  tank_tech_1:0 "Scrap Tank"
  tank_tech_1_desc:0 "While gun truck and APCs provide light armor and firepower to our mechanized divisions, the enemy is beginning to field better anti-armor weaponry. The solution is a simple one. A tracked chassis rebuilt from plans for industrial construction vehicles armored with slabs of concrete as well as spaced steel layers sandwiched between them provides protection against even simple rocket launchers, while firing ports and armored ball mounts let our vehicles be armed with a choice of small arms, heavy machineguns and anti-tank rifles. The forward bulldozer blade also let our crew demolish fortified positions and ram enemy AFVs."
  tank_tech_2:0 "Wasteland Tank"
  tank_tech_2_desc:0 "Completely cutting out the improvised superstructure and beginning from the hull base again lets us design a much more efficient AFV. Angled armor for better protection at a lesser tonnage, securized ammo storage, a hull mounted and coaxial machinegun as well as an actual powered turret with an infantry support gun improves their efficiency against soft and hard target alike, while the lighter armoring made of hardened steel plates let the same engine achieve higher speeds and take our enemy by surprise."
  tank_tech_3:0 "Great War Tank"
  tank_tech_3_desc:0 "While the design process of the tank itself is very straightforward, considering the amount of plans and intact vehicles found in bunkers, the manufacturing and supply is not. Pre-war technology requires advanced manufacturing capabilities or very creative thinking. Replacing the extremely advanced depleted uranium plating by a much simpler alloy front plate, unifying the four-tracked system into a two-tracked one and replacing extensive internal electronics by simpler substitutes such as mechanical devices and uncomplicated fire control modules allows our military factories to build a fearsome product of the past."

  truck_equipment_1:0 "Scrap Gun Truck"
  truck_equipment_1_desc:0 "Cobbled together from scrap found in junkyard or old military bases, those gun trucks aren't much to look at. But while the scrap metal can barely hold against small arms fire and the engine has trouble keeping up with the increased weight, they make for effective protection for our infantry elements, which would never be caught complaining about not being shot. A mounted automatic rifle on a pintle mount provides supporting fire during disembarking, but the crew of these vehicles are expressly told not to engage in direct combat otherwise."
  truck_equipment_2:0 "Salvaged Gun Truck"
  truck_equipment_2_desc:0 "Another product of our salvage network, those trucks are a mismatch of rusted armor plating taken from dilapidated vehicles and engine units trying to work together through a hastily-designed transmission. Sporting better defenses than previous models, these trucks are also armed with a proper mounted machine gun with it's crew protected by a gun shield. Better provisions are also made for the embarking infantry to let them stock more firepower inside and be more comfortable riding in and out of battle."

  storage_vehicle_tech:0 "Additional Storage"
  storage_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Providing welded metal baskets for our vehicles will let our crew store their gear more safely than if it was just thrown on it. More equipment into battle allows our mobile divisions and tracked vehicles to go much longer without needing refuelling and rearming, lessening the strain on our supply network."
  overclock_vehicle_tech:0 "Engine Overclocking"
  overclock_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Transforming the powerpacks of our armored vehicles into gas guzzlers might seem like a bad idea, but open valves, wider fuel pipeline, and scrapped protective casing for better cooling will give an impressive burst of speed to even the heaviest tank. Such changes will of course require a better fuel manufacturing network, but the tactical and strategical advantage cannot be ignored."
  gunport_vehicle_tech:0 "Gun Ports"
  gunport_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Cut-out gun ports in the passenger compartment of our APCs, as well as pistol ports for our tanks, will add every available firepower on board to the fight. Pistol ports allows our tank crew to defend themselves from infantry assault, while gun ports in our vehicles will let rifle fire slam into any soft target foolish enough to get near. The vehicle crew, however, has to slow down to allow accurate fire."
  high_tech_fuel_vehicle_tech:0 "Advanced Fuels"
  high_tech_fuel_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Advanced chemical manufacturing, such as molecular filtering, result in fuels with higher octane rating and thus much more suited to tuned engines with better compression ratios. Less dirt and impurities will also increase the service duration of our fuel filters and combustion chambers, increasing the service life of our powerpacks."

  apc_equipment_1:0 "Salvaged APC"
  apc_equipment_1_desc:0 "Salvaged heavy trucks clad in armor provides a much more suitable base to our mechanized divisions. Thicker armor plating supported by better suspensions and high-torque engines can now resist rifle fire, laser attacks and even anti-tank rifle projectiles. A forward-mounted heavy machine gun with provision to move it to other firing ports throughout the vehicle brings suitable firepower for frontline combat, and all these features combine finally allow our vehicle crew to directly support our infantry division, resulting in much better combined-arm defenses and assaults."
  apc_equipment_2:0 "Wasteland APC"
  apc_equipment_2_desc:0 "A tracked chassis to navigate the blasted wasteland much easier, together with a twin coupled engine drive and reinforced armor platings is the result of our engineers' effort into better AFVs for our mechanized divisions. A ramp system allowing disembarking under armor protection, an external communication system for infantry support and a new mixed machine gun belt with incendiary and armor-piercing projectiles continue to improve the cooperation potential between vehicles and infantry."
  apc_equipment_3:0 "Great War APC"
  apc_equipment_3_desc:0 "Pre-war APCs are the top of the line in matter of what we can manufacture currently. Composite armor plating with spall liners, as well as kevlar protection for crew and mounted infantry alike will save the lives of many foot soldier, while the short infantry support gun will blast apart any fortified position or enemy that our boys on the ground may encounter."

### Courier Kit ###
 
 courier_equipment_1:0 "Courier Kit"
 courier_equipment_1_desc:0 "Traditionally, couriers in the wasteland carried only messages or small packages, anything larger needed a full fledged caravan. Nowadays, couriers operate out of supply hubs across the wasteland, where caravans bring large shipments, and the couriers distribute the goods to various units and towns."
