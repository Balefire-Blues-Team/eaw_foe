 flavour.7.t:0 "The §NBlight§! Spreads"
 flavour.7.d:0 "A strange illness has been reported in our territories, infecting both Creature and land alike.\nA brief investigation has reported several small villages suffering from unexplained coughs, sunken eyes and thinning Fur. More concerning, Healing potions and conventional medicine seem to have no effect on this mysterious disease.\nInterviews with the infected pointed our team in the direction of suspicious plant life that patient zero in our territory had contact with. A scout team sent to investigate found a grove of rotting plants emitting some sort of green miasma. We have taken care to exterminate this grove, but new reports of infections are still coming in on the daily.\nOur foreign contacts suggest that this §NBlight§! hails from Trotsylvania, and §ODumbrava Mointain§! to be specific. Until we have further information, we cannot confirm this, but measures still must be taken.\n\nWe will have to send the military to enforce quarantines in the affected areas, if we want to contain the spread!"
