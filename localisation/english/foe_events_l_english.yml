 flavour.7.t:0 "The §NBlight§! Spreads"
 flavour.7.d:0 "A strange illness has been reported in our territories, infecting both Creature and land alike.\nA brief investigation has reported several small villages suffering from unexplained coughs, sunken eyes and thinning Fur. More concerning, Healing potions and conventional medicine seem to have no effect on this mysterious disease.\nInterviews with the infected pointed our team in the direction of suspicious plant life that patient zero in our territory had contact with. A scout team sent to investigate found a grove of rotting plants emitting some sort of green miasma. We have taken care to exterminate this grove, but new reports of infections are still coming in on the daily.\nOur foreign contacts suggest that this §NBlight§! hails from Trotsylvania, and §ODumbrava Mointain§! to be specific. Until we have further information, we cannot confirm this, but measures still must be taken.\n\nWe will have to send the military to enforce quarantines in the affected areas, if we want to contain the spread!"

flavour.8.t:0 "The Black Village"
flavour.8.d:0 "Disconcerting news reached Napoca today:\nOn a routine sweep, one of our cleanser-squads has come across the village of Ecrish on the outscirts of Purda. The last inspection 2 weeks ago saw the village still healthy, and to the best of our knowledge, Purda itself, as well as many nearby homesteads are still mostly unaffected by the Blight.\nEcrish, however has succumbed to it fully, and at a much faster rate than any previously recorded cases. It's inhabitants range from deathly sick ponies, to pulsing masses of black goo, weaving an intricate web of tar-like strings between the buildings of the village.\nCuriously enough, the Blight-creatures of Ecrish do not attack on sight like their brethren, but will only defend themselves when attacked.\n\nOur Magi want us to isolate but preserve the village, to study this strange strain of the Blight, and maybe gain some insight.\nThe Cleansers, as always, advocate for wiping Ecrish from the map for good."

flavour.9.t:0 "A new Evil"
flavour.9.d:0 "2 days ago, our Magi reported a massive surge of magical energy from Dumbrava Mountain. Preliminary analysis from our own Magi, as well as those of friendly sects within the Toll were able to quickly classify it as a mixture of both necromantic and hydromantic magics.\nWhile there was a brief burst of panic, we were soon elated when reports came in that all Blight-creatures both within our nation and elsewhere had suddenly collapsed and were no longer attacking. For 2 days we had the faint but growing hope that the nightmare was over, that whatever caused the Blight had burned through whatever source fueled it and would at last leave us in peace.\n\nThe rain this morning banished any such happy thoughts, as the droplets were brackish and carried with them miniscule amounts of Blightseeds. To our horror, this rain has also effected most of the small rivers and wells in our nation, spreading the bight further than ever before.\nFor the moment, we have water-reserves and purifiers, but this new vector of infection is sure to make things much worse in the long run..."

flavour.10.t:0 "Ides of March"
flavour.10.d:0 "Soilside, one of the districts of Napoca, was once a bustling hub of activity, full of the sounds and smells of a thriving community. But now, the streets are empty, the buildings are in disrepair, and an eerie silence hangs over the area. The Blight has taken over, infecting the residents and wreaking havoc on their bodies and minds.\n\nThis strain is unlike anything the city has ever seen before. It spreads quickly, causing high fever, coughing, and severe fatigue, but it also has a more insidious effect. Those who are infected by the Blight seem to lose touch with reality, experiencing vivid hallucinations and delusions that drive them to the brink of madness and incite violence.\nThe district is now a shadow of its former self, a place of fear and desperation. The few remaining residents huddle together, hoping to avoid infection, but knowing that their fate is uncertain. The city has cordoned off the area, hoping to contain the spread of the illness, but it is only a matter of time before the Blight spills over into the wider community.\nAlready the first few are beginning to show symptoms of late-stage infection, oily blightstuff running from eyes and nose, while their thirst drives them to drink so much that their flesh gets puffy and their stomachs bloat.\n\nThe Cleansers have been called in, but this will have to be a slow and careful operation, so as to not endanger the rest of the city. Chances are, some of the other districts already carry the Blight anyways..."

flavour.11.t:0 "Cost of Progress"
flavour.11.d:0 "Our Magi have extensively studied the strain of the Blight that dwells within Ecrish.\nEvery single one of the former inhabitants has now turned into a Blight-creature, though they thankfully continue their uncharacteristically peaceful behaviour. While they don't seem to be alive by our usual definitions, they nontheless seem more aware and active than your typical undead construct. They are, however, still undeniably necromantic creatures.\nOver the last few weeks, the Ecrish-strain has also started to exibit wholle new behaviours, namely the crude mimicry of Pony-forms. Where normal Blight-creatures are little more than an animated mass of Inky tendrills and black liquid, these are slowly learning to shape themselves into something approximating a pony.\n\nThe Magi are fascinated by this development, and are requesting that we provide a number of dead bodies to be infected in isolation, and 'taught' to be more pony-like."

flavour.12.t:0 "Freedom in surrender"
flavour.12.d:0 "The Magi's findings have been highly disturbing...\n\nThe Blight is indeed necromantic, though it is a reanimated fungus that is rapidly spreading within all organic life it comes into contact with. Frankly, the idea of reanimating creatures that never possessed a soul in the first place still seems ludicrous to most of us, but the Magi's findings seem conclusive. Much less reasonable however is their suggestion. Apparently, the Ecrish-Strain is showing a strong abbility to mimic the organic lifeforms it devours, and even displays a rudimentary intelligence in simple tasks it has been taught. Not only that, but carefully selecting specimens of live Radroaches, along with properly taught Blight, can seemingly enter into some sort of symbiosis, where the Ecrish-strain feeds of the host's nutrients, without fully devouring them. Additionally, the Ecrish strain has proven highly territorial, sterilizing any other Blight-strains that enter its host's body.\nThe Magi believe, that this benign Strain could be used as an innoculation, though it would require deliberately infecting our whole population.\n This whole proposal is frankly ridiculous, but nontheless there are a few optimists in our government that believe we should give it a shot.\n\nThe Magi will require a year and much of our countries resources to make it happen, but they promise to fight Blight with Blight."
