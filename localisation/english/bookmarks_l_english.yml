  BM_HISTORY_TITLE: "Brief History"
  FOE_NAME: "Fallout: Equestria"
  FOE_DESC: "Once upon a time, in the magical land Of Equestria...\nThe world was bathed in radioactive balefire, and the world was nearly wiped clean. Ponies survived, but they did not thrive. Those who survived were greeted by a new world, a world of ashes and suffering, but they kept going. Some were twisted by the wastes into killers or monsters, some were not. Those who were not had to find new ways of surviving, from both the wasteland and those that it had transformed."
  EYE_FOE_DESC: "Through wit and charisma, Red Eye has amassed one of the most formidable armies to ever trot across the Equestrian Wasteland. His conquest of Fillydelphia was followed with a largely successful campaign of expansion and enslavement, growing his already formidable slaver state into a formidable empire.\n\nWhile his army and fame have grown, his ambitions have remained the same. While he now holds onto the industry resources needed to further his goal, only Red Eye himself knows the future of what lies ahead of not only him, but the entire Heartland."
  MSR_FOE_DESC: "Out of the ruins of Manehattan stands another mighty Steel Ranger contingent: the Manehattan Steel Rangers. Tracing their roots back to the original foundation of the Ministry of Wartime Technology, these Rangers operate out of the mighty fortification known as Bucklyn Cross.\n\nStill, just like its sister contingents, the Manehattan Rangers face many problems of their own. While the contingent itself hosts a considerable amount of renowned individuals, Elder Cottage Cheese's isolationist attitude has kept the contingent quiet yet stagnant. It's up to the Steel Rangers of Manehattan to either continue to keep to themselves, or finally set hoof on the Wasteland."
  SHA_FOE_DESC: "The Shattered Hoof Raiders have cemented themselves as the powerhouse of Azuria. But just as they have earned their victories, the raiders do not truly realize what troubles surround their leader.\n\nUnknown to most, Deadeyes rules his gang in a fickle position. He knows his boss, Mister Topaz, regards him as nothing but a lackey. Meanwhile, the Junction R-7 Talons have also began to worsen their relations with the raiders, no doubt thanks to their new principled leader Gawdyna Grimfeathers. Either way, only fate has a say in what happens to Azuria as a whole."
  UNI_FOE_DESC: "The telepathic hivemind known as the Unity stands as one of the most unique forces to arise out of the Wasteland. Originating from Maripony, the once fabled Ministry of Arcane Sciences facility, the Goddess has always had a simple yet ambitious objective: transform all ponies into the superior Alicorn.\n\nThe Goddess herself has quite the unique problem to deal with, however, as she shares the consciousness with other personalities. Whether this will be a problem for the Unity, or a hidden boon, it is up for the Goddess to decide as she works toward her goal of saving the Wasteland."
  NEV_FOE_DESC: "Neighvarro serves as the largest military base the Enclave has on the Wasteland. Using unrivalled technology and superior Pegasi discipline, the Enclave have had little issue defending itself from the outside world. Yet while Neighvarro functions as a formidable headquarters for surface operations, it also serves as its only significant one.\n\nHaving set their sights on Equestria once more, it will take a considerable amount of effort for the Enclave to establish their influence on the surface and subjugate the mutants that still tread on Equestrian soil."
  FSR_FOE_DESC: "Backed into the southern corner of Fillydelphia, the Fillydelphia Contingent still holds against Red Eye's forces. Despite their superior technology and better training, the slaver army continues to pressure the Steel Ranger contingent by day and night.\n\nWhen not dealing with slavers, the contingent deals with its other problems. While they still work towards their original founding purpose, there is a considerable amount of rising strife in the leadership, as all who serve the chains are content with the current objective."
  TEN_FOE_DESC: "There is no place more isolated from reality than Tenpony Tower. All who reside from within live in their own world of luxury, while those who remain  outside have little hope of interacting with the citizens within.\n\nWastelanders may know about the life of luxury within, but know little about its true rulers, the secretive Twilight Society. As the tower holds a unique number of individuals, it also holds the famous athenaeum built by Twilight Sparkle. While the Twilight Society keeps this information hidden from the outside, what they choose to do with this power remains up to them, or some others..."
  OAP_FOE_DESC: "A haven for slave trade and a place of dread for all who oppose the slaver system, Old Appleloosa stands as one of the most economically prosperous hubs in the Wasteland.\n\nWhile the Shackles family still holds power, they are not the only faction that wishes to use the nation's prosperity for greater use. Some seek to use the prowess of the Desert Rangers to aid our cause instead of harming it, while others may seek to transform the entire nation as a whole into something more... traditional."
  LIT_FOE_DESC: "Out of the ashes of the Old World arose a community that challenged the morals of all other nations in the Wasteland, the tribal confederation known as the Lightning Scavengers.\n\nFormed out of a purpose to restore hope and, perhaps even harmony, the confederation still faces many challenges: both inwards and outwards. The three races of ponies have found reasons to quarrel, while the Thunder-War has caused the tribe to lose a harsh war to Featherbrush's Talons to the north."
  MAS_FOE_DESC: "Tucked away in the middle of Wasteland, The Ministry of Arcane Sciences still remains. Once regarded as perhaps the most powerful of all the ministries, it now remains as the only official ministry left.\n\nAs a stable with a relatively quiet history thanks to the skillful leadership of its ministers, it wasn't until the General Strike of 1162 that the stable was sent into chaos. Since then, our administration has slowly recovered, but the aftereffects of the strike still linger."
  HIT_FOE_DESC: "Many would tell you not to expect much out of any tribe located in the Foal Mountains, but that's only because they've never met Overhill.\n\nWith the arrival of the sorceress known as Inky Lotus, Overhill only needs time to properly prepare. First the tribes of the Foal Mountains shall tremble, then the rest of the Wasteland."
  GRV_FOE_DESC: "Much of the Green Valley tribe's history is shared with their infamous Elder, Sun-Above-Clouds. He has guided his own tribe for dozens of years, if not far more, all for the very purpose of satisfying the Moon's wishes while yearning for its true blessing.\n\nNot all within the tribe share the same opinion of their Elder, however. A considerable amount still see his talks with the Moon as utter nonsense, and would much rather desire to introduce a far more impressive thing to the tribe: the world of industry."
  FTR_FOE_DESC: "In the northern forests of the Wasteland lie the Foal Valley Tribe. While left alone from most outside affairs, these tribal ponies hold a quaint history of their own.\n\nA tribe of hardy warriors, their new leader, Burnt Aspen, has dreams of uniting her tribe with her isolated foals to the north. While this may seem like a goal that may help restore the two tribes, Red Eye's empire to the south may force this cause to take a back seat."
  FTP_FOE_DESC: "Isolated from the rest of the Wasteland in the mountain peaks, the foals of Foaltopia have managed to stay strong and united under Lamp Light's leadership, as boring as he is.\n\nAlthough, running a society solely consisting of foals has definitely proven to be a... unique experience. After all, nopony wants to take the time to coordinate and order others around. But somehow, these foals have managed."
  WNF_FOE_DESC: "Located on the eastern edge of the Foal Mountains, the Winsome Tribe has had a slow yet careful history. Dark Cloud is a young Warchief, yet he has already earned the respect of his warriors through his speeches to unite the entire valley.\n\nTheir recent conflict with Foal Valley has led them on the weaker end in terms of power, causing a faction of revanchists to form. There are rumors of their desire to turn the tribe into a republic, and perhaps unite the rest of the valley through diplomacy."
  MRA_FOE_DESC: "Most if not all of the chaos stirred in Manehattan is caused by none other than the Manehattan Raiders. Even with a long history of killing any pathetic wastelander that dare trots on raider grounds, they are nearly always beaten back.\n\nOnce upon a time, these raiders had the ruined city under their hooves. Now, it's up to their infamous leader known as the Bonecrusher to restore the gang to its former glory."
  MWY_FOE_DESC: "New Mareway's best days lay behind it: a long standing beacon of stability and civilization since the end of the Great War, the feudal realm has struggled against the changing times. 15 years ago, Mareway was plunged into a quick but brutal civil war, sparked by the previous Queen's sister, Golden Star (now known as Blood Mane), and her attempt to take the throne for herself.\n\nNow lead by the young and optimistic Star Gazer, New Mareway must adapt if it is to survive, but it remains to be seen if tradition will survive as well."
  NCG_FOE_DESC: "Investment, Capital, Prosperity...\nMany in the wasteland have forgotten these words that once held sway over the Equestrian economy. Not so in Neocastle, where the descendants of Wartime corporations waited out the apocalypse in the mines and tunnels.\nThe Three Guilds rule with a golden hoof over employee, indentured servant and mercenary soldier alike, their goals always aligned with maximum profit.\nBut how rich can you get before greater ambitions beckon?\nThe Rise of Red Eye might just be the ultimate opportunity for some...Hostile Takeovers."
  ERA_FOE_DESC: "There are many reasons a pony would join the Bloody Army: loyalty to it's would-be Queen, Blood Mane, a desire to fight the injustices of New Mareway, or the simple urge to beat the shit out of other people. 15 years ago, the Army was pushed to the northern side of the Ponytomic River, and it's had eyes only for revenge ever since.\n\nBlood Mane, once a member of the royal family of Mareway, has made a deal with Red Eye. In exchange for helping her reconquer her claims, the Army will swear fealty to Fillydelphia; although it's commander may have other plans..."
  CAL_FOE_DESC: "Once we were one, now we are many\nOnce we were slaves, now we are free\nOnce there was the Goddess, now there is Nightseer!\n\nSent out as an expedition of Alicorns by the Goddess, we were supposed to find the Black Book and aid in her domination of the Wasteland. The Pink Cloud, bane that it is to the living, became our savior: Where it melts the flesh of our lessers, it merely scoured away the influence of the Goddess from us.\nA reckoning is coming, and the false Goddess shall pay for our enslavement with her life, for only one is truly divine: NIGHTSEER!"
  OTHER_FOE_DESC: "The Great War plunged the world into seemingly eternal darkness and threw everything into chaos. Creatures struggled to survive and over the decades the survivors banded into larger and larger groups.\n\nSettlers continue on in an attempt to retain the morals of the old world. Tribals stalk the lands of their ancestors, hunting and avoiding the technology left behind by the old world. Raiders continue to dominate the wasteland, killing, pillaging, and burning. Resources are scarce and the numerous communities of the wasteland are always struggling to survive."
