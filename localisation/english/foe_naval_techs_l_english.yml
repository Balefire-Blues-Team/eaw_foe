foe_nautics_tech_1:0 "Fishing Boat"
ship_hull_foe_light_1_desc:0 "OUTDATED!\nWith a lack of modern machinery and suitable dockyards, many have been forced to use old wooden ships as the backbone of their navy. This old simplistic design has allowed various nations to produce them in large quantities. The speed of these ships varies depending on the quality of its sail and the strength of the wind.This allows them to play a multi purpose role, ranging from simple transports and gunboats, to the more ambitious Galleon Warships. Reliable as it might be, against any other more powerful warships, its survivability drops drastically."
nautics_tech_2:0 "Reinforced Hulls"
nautics_tech_2_desc:0 ""

foe_light_navy_hull_tech_2:0 "Yacht"
ship_hull_foe_light_2_desc:0 "Small, light and most importantly fast, it's a favorite for many traders, smugglers, and especially raiders. Because of its light design, it can easily be carried by a small group allowing them to move to different waterways with little effort . Using small motor engines, these boats have both the speed and maneuverability to outrun most heavily armored ships. It's these strengths that are its greatest weakness. With little to no armor, much less armament to defend itself, its use as an actual fighting ship is dangerous, but the denizens of the wasteland have made it work."
foe_light_navy_hull_tech_3:0 "Patrol Boat"
ship_hull_foe_light_3_desc:0 "Having the relative speed of a motor boat but with enough firepower to handle any small armored ship, the patrol boat serves that multi-role goal. Its purpose is to protect the nation's waters against raiders, smugglers and if need be, serve as a light assault ship . Slightly better armored, it is armed with multiple mounted weapons which can vary from Grenade Machine Guns to Rocket Launchers. With two motor engines, it still has the speed and maneuverability required to protect its waters."
foe_light_navy_hull_tech_4:0 "Frigate"
ship_hull_foe_light_4_desc:0 "The first real step into building a true fleet and becoming a major naval power on Equus, frigates are the backbone of any modern navy. Using old models found in navel scrap yards and surviving wrecks that survived the nuclear calamity, we can reverse-engineer blueprints. These ships serve as escorts and scouts becoming the eyes and ears of the navy. "
foe_light_navy_hull_tech_5:0 "Destroyer"
ship_hull_foe_light_5_desc:0 "While playing a similar role to frigates, destroyers have far more firepower which makes them a staple in most fleets. Carrying an array of torpedoes and deck-guns, it has enough firepower to engage numerous ships including battlecruisers. However, their missile capability is what makes them so dangerous to any adversary, as it enables them to hit targets at long distance both on land and sea with the added bonus of potentially carrying balefire warheads."

heavy_navy_hull_tech_1:0 "Barge"
ship_hull_foe_heavy_1_desc:0 "Nicknamed “Barrack Ships”, these support ships serve a variety of roles ranging from transporting troops, supporting naval landings and providing overwhelming firepower. As the largest ships in a wasteland navy they often serve as Flagships and fleet anchors. Their heavy armor and broad hull design makes them significantly slower than smaller hulls."
heavy_navy_hull_tech_2:0 "Battle Tanker"
ship_hull_foe_heavy_2_desc:0 "Battle Tankers provide support for any naval invasions with a variation of indirect weapons such as Cannons, mortars, and rockets. They can also serve the role as merchant raiding vessels, conducting  convoy raiding across the sea by disguising themselves  as any regular merchant ship. This gives them the element of surprise allowing them to approach enemy vessels and inflict heavy damage upon them."
heavy_navy_hull_tech_3:0 "Battlecruiser"
ship_hull_foe_heavy_3_desc:0 "This Behemoth of a ship is the pride of any fleet, a retrofitted and rearmed battlecruiser of Equestria’s past, this ship is a terror on the ocean and has the weaponry to back that up. Battleships sport howitzer guns, an array of numerous Missile defense systems with the latest of AI technology, and late war models even host a massive energy based railcannon that can easily penetrate the thickest of armor. Only the best and the most elite are given the honor of serving on this legendary vessel."

carrier_hull_tech_1:0 "Cargo-Carrier"
carrier_foe_equipment_1_desc:0 "Used once to transport large amounts of cargo from one country to another via sea routes. This ship acts like a miniature fortress, giving it the ability to transport and launch planes as well as serve  as a supply dockyard. It can also be used as  a command vessel that can maintain standoff distance thanks to its planes, allowing the vessel to focus much of its time on organizing and coordinating with the fleet."
carrier_hull_tech_2:0 "Aircraft Carrier"
carrier_foe_equipment_2_desc:0 "Using the hulls of late war warships, this design sacrifices armor and firepower in exchange for providing air support for the navy. Able to carry a large assortment of fighters, bombers and flying personnel, it allows it to fill multiple roles ranging from anti-ship to close air support. While these ships went out of favor in the war due to the rise of Cloudships, they will be invaluable for any Wasteland navy."
