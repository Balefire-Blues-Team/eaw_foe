### MEGASPELL EVENTS ###

 megaspells.1.title:0 "A Bomb"
 megaspells.1.desc:0 "The Lightbringer has placed what seems to be an undetonated balefire bomb in our care..."
 megaspells.1.a:0 "What are we supposed to do with this?!"

 megaspells.3.title:0 "New Appleloosa's Bomb"
 megaspells.3.desc:0 "Word has finally made it to us that New Appleloosa has an undetonated balefire bomb stored away. They are obviously completely unequipped to deal with such power, and it is only logical that we take that burden off of their backs..."
 megaspells.3.a:0 "Send the demands."

 megaspells.4.title:0 "A Demand from [RED.GetName]"
 megaspells.4.desc:0 "Our old \"friend\", [RED.GetLeader] has sent us a short demand. They want very little, just our recently acquired Balefire Bomb..."

 megaspells.4.b:0 "No!"

 megaspells.5.title:0 "New Appleloosa's Response"
 megaspells.5.desc:0 "Like we predicted, New Appleloosa caved, and handed over the bomb to our envoy, who has successfully brought it back to our territory for our \"safekeeping\""
 megaspells.5.a:0 "Wonderful!"

 megaspells.6.title:0 "New Appleloosa's Response"
 megaspells.6.desc:0 "Surprisingly, New Appleloosa refused to hand over the bomb, and turned our envoy away..."
 megaspells.6.a:0 "There is little we can do..."

 megaspells.7.title:0 "The Lightbringer's Bargain"
 megaspells.7.desc:0 "We have been contacted by none other than the Lightbringer herself, who has made a very convincing argument as to why we should give her our balefire bomb for her own use against our common enemy. Surely this cannot backfire."
 megaspells.7.a:0 "It's an offer we can't refuse!"
