 unification.9.t:0 "Rise of the S.D.A."
 unification.9.d:0 "Today, officials from all members of the Military alliance, known as the S.D.A. have met in Chernusk and decided on a fateful course of action:\nThe Members of the S.D.A. have officially renounced their independence, and announced that the Severyana-Defense-Alliance will from now on carry all functions of Statehood these former nations held.\n\nSeveryanan Radio cited threats from the South and East as the reason for this deepening of ties.\nAs the various members of the S.D.A. had already spent years integrating their economies and militaries, many expect this transition to be seamless.\nWhat the future might hold for this fledgeling Nation is unknown, but S.D.A. leaders are confident that they can weather whatever is to come.\n"
