  SLV_our_origin:0 "An Unlikely Alliance"
  SLV_our_origin_desc:0 "Thirty years ago the settlements of Silver Fang Shanty, The Roof, UPSville, and its many disparate residents joined together under one banner for the purpose of bringing down a renegade Enclave Cloudship who's crew had captured a local Wasteland Hero. Organized by the husband of said hero, the Battle that followed was hard fought, and not without its share of losses, but in the end the Alliance proved victorious. The most notable of these losses were the entire regional assosiation of Regulators under a Legendary Regulators's command, who's loss was felt for months after the battle. In this time of vulnerability many looked for an answer as their tenuous unity frayed, when one of the Local Hero's companions returned from the northern territories."

  SLV_walking_relic:0 "The Walking Relic"
  SLV_walking_relic_desc:0 "On crimson wings the soldier came to The Roof, accompanied by another red pegasus, both wearing the unmistakable purple battlesuits of the Ministry of Awesome and wielding impressive weapons, as though they had stepped from the paper of an Old World poster. Markerlight was his name. He offered weapons, training, and protection in return for the ability to recruit from among the population. Many scoffed at his request, but not all. Some chose to join this strange pegasus and learn his ways. He taught them cohesion of purpose, valor in battle, and selflessness in duty. He taught them Unity, Harmony, and to Trust the creature beside them. He instilled in them the morality of Old. Then he taught them how to Kill."

  SLV_living_roots:0 "The Living Roots of a Dead Tree"
  SLV_living_roots_desc:0 "At first it was unnoticed, a few less raider attacks here and there, less eventful caravan runs, but eventually rumors started to circulate of groups of five creatures wiping out entire raider parties with impressive regularity. As the rumors swelled over the months with details and first-hoof accounts the number of Raiders swiftly declined. When the crimson pegasus came to Silver Fang Shanty with the same offer he'd given The Roof, at the head of a half-dozen well armored creatures, he was met with a challenge. The leader of the settlement refused him the right to recruit unless he could beat her in single combat. Unwilling to back down, both pegasi met the other overhead in flurry of hooves, feathers, and weather. In the end, the fight was one-sided, the mare defeated at the stallion's hoof. True to her word, she allowed him to recruit from among her mercenaries. With such a public show of skill, recruitment skyrocketed from among the towns-creatures. Gryphons, earth ponies, unicorns, and pegasi. Regardless of species or race he treated them as one and the same, even Zebra and Zonies found no malice for their stripes among his followers."

  SLV_industrial_fires:0 "To Reignite the fires of industry"
  SLV_industrial_fires_desc:0 "When he came to UPSville it was not with a rank of soldiers and weapons, but with engineers, salvage experts, and scouts. He sought to win their admiration with a grand gesture first, and deliver his request after. When he arrived however the town was under siege, Raiders from across the river had come, intent on ravaging the population and taking what they wished. Outnumbered, outgunned, and unprepared he led the scouts into the fray and scattered the blood-loving attackers to the four winds, before rushing to aid the survivors. His offer was accepted without much consideration, and with the help of his engineers the town began not only scavenging materials once again, but even forging it into new equipment. For the first time in a century industry kindles itself on the shore of a thousand battles."
  
  SLV_awesome_vigil:0 "and the Vigil of Awesome"
  SLV_awesome_vigil_desc:0 "As the region unified and more creatures joined his ranks, others left to settle back down with the morals he'd instilled in them firmly in mind. The stallion took a step back from leadership and allowed a mare who fully embodied those principles take the reins: Prism Blitz, a mare many could confuse for Rainbow Dash herself given her resemblance and attitude. For twenty-five years she has molded her soldiers into a determined fighting force. No single Raider or Slaver could best them in battle, they carried the best weapons and armor that could be produced, and had such tactics, strategies, and plans that none could stand against them. For the last twenty-five years... They held the line. As for Markerlight, eventually he moved on. Taking a team of his most skilled soldiers to repeat his efforts elsewhere. But his efforts, his determination to help others better themselves, his legacy, and that of the Founding Heroes? For better or ill it remains to this day."

  SLV_Rallying_the_Sand_Dogs_desc:0 "Hellhounds hate ponies, thats just a well established an known fact. What most creatures like to forget is that not every canid is a Hellhound. There are still plenty unmutated Sand Dogs, Diamond Dogs, and depending on how far north you go... Snow Dogs, if something were to happen to the Hellhounds of Pleasent Valley, those less violent dogs living among them will probably run. While its not ideal, passing up on a signifiant population of Sand Dogs is a fools play. We just need to take care not to drive them away"
    
  SLV_Increase_hunting_and_livestock_industries:0 "Increase Hunting and Livestock Industries"
  SLV_Increase_hunting_and_livestock_industries_desc:0 "Sand Dogs eat meat and gems, fair enough. Most folk eat meat alot. Unfortunately they eat almost exclusivly meat, like a good number of gryphons. Promoting an increase to the number of Ranchers and Hunters providing meat products can only imrove their view towards us"
    
  SLV_Offer_safe_warrens:0 "Offer Safe Warrens"
  SLV_Offer_safe_warrens_desc:0 "Most Sand Dogs prefer not to live among ponies, thats just normal. Fortunately we have pleanty of underground territory left unexploited. With hoof-ful of surveys near the ruins of Yellow Sign, we could mark out land that the Dogs could potentially use for their underground settlements."
    
  SLV_Promote_Sand_Dog_inclusion_in_industry:0 "Promote Sand Dog inclusion in our Industries"
  SLV_Promote_Sand_Dog_inclusion_in_industry_desc:0 "When it comes to mining, demolition, and energy technology Sand Dogs, Diamond Dogs, and the rare Hellhound are beyond the veil compared to most of our engineers. This specialization lends itself well to mining, and more importantly to the locating of rare gem veins deep beneath the surface that even the most skilled of unicorns would be pressed to find."

  SLV_Open_volunteer_service_to_the_Hounds_desc:0 "While the medical and mining fields are invaluable services to our people, the Militia serves as a public face of security and protection in the Alliance.

  SLV_Offer_admission_to_Officer_Schools:0 "Offer Admission to Officer Schools"
  SLV_Offer_admission_to_Officer_Schools_desc:0 "Higher Education is a goal that most in the wasteland wouldn't really think about very often. But among those with a background in fighting and leadership, our Officer Schools are among the best around. Allowing the Dogs the ability to learn from the best, and potentially become Officers in their own right, and potentially lead their own formations into battle one day. "
    
  SLV_Opening_Mercenary_Contracts:0 "Opening Mercenary Contracts"
  SLV_Opening_Mercenary_Contracts_desc:0 "With the destruction of Featherfalls Talons, his gryphons have taken to the wind and scattered. Many of them are low on caps, low on ammunition, and in desperate need of a place to rest and recuperate. With Silver Fang's long tradition as a Mercenary Safe Haven, many will likely come to us. At least for a time, given the circumstances it might be worthwhile to authorize a number of mercenary contracts to these desperate bands to draw them over to our side."
    
  SLV_Securing_Contract_Agreements:0 "Securing Contract Agreements"
  SLV_Securing_Contract_Agreements_desc:0 "'By signing this agreement, you agree to provide local assistance to the town of __________. Including assisting local law enforcement, providing defensive support for _________, and commiting to assisting its local population in cases of danger.' A simple line on paper to some, but an oath of honor to any Talon. So long as we provide them with contracts, and stay good on our payments to them. The new Alliance Branch of the Talons should prove a decisive advantage."
    
  SLV_Moving_the_Dependants:0 "Moving the Dependants"
  SLV_Moving_the_Dependants_desc:0 "Mercenary or not, Gryphons are living beings, and a fair number of them have families of their own. Families that have been displaced just like them by Featherfalls defeat. By offering them a safe place to settle, they'll be less likely to take contracts that could directly endanger their chicks, and to a lesser degree make the mercenaries more amniable to our contracts and offers."
    
  SLV_Military_Aid_Contracts:0 "Military Aid Contracts"
  SLV_Military_Aid_Contracts_desc:0 "While not much different from the usual defense contracts, the payout one can expect from a Military Aid contract is signifigantly higher, especially during times of war. No self respecting Talon would turn one down out of hoof, especially one from such an outwardly 'Clean' organization like ours. After all, we have rules and morals on how we conduct war... sure it makes us seem 'Soft' to the Talons, but 'Soft' to them is the same as 'Easy Paycheck'. Either way we come out ahead. Even if a few caps lighter."
    
  SLV_Limited_Autonamy:0 "Limited Talon Autonamy"
  SLV_Limited_Autonamy_desc:0 "Reducing the military overview to advisory personnel and authorizing greater independant action in the name of the Alliance should lower the time it takes to perform operations for our new Talons. Though we will keep a close eye to ensure those leading them don't step over the line and become the next Featherfall."
    
  SLV_Death_of_Unity:0 "Death of Unity"
  SLV_Death_of_Unity_desc:0 "We all heard it... the death of the Goddess wasn't exactly hard to miss, even to those far away. But everyone could feel her anguished cry, with her death the Alicorns have fled in every cardinal direction. Some have been spotted in the skies near our territory, others have been seen walking in small herds, dazed. Shellshocked even. Yet the most shocking are those who's wits remain. Among them was a mare named Whimsy Wandering... a mare who disappeared from the caravan trails nearly a decade ago. Now she's back... but she sure isn't a unicorn any more! Worse still, she's probably not going to be the only one of her kind seeking shelter."
    
  SLV_or_should_we_leave_them:0 "...or should we leave them?"
  SLV_or_should_we_leave_them_desc:0 " While most consider Alicorns to be just as dangerous and unpredictable as Hellhounds, without Unity providing the Guidance of the Goddess, they're just as dangerous as the average wastelander. Granted, they're certainly better looking than most monters, and certainly are far more agreeable than even the calmest of Hellhound, but still. They are Alicorns...                                                                                                                           so we will be better off with their kind removed!

  SLV_Merciful_Goddesses_desc:0 "It seems that despite their status as 'The Boogymare's of the Wastes', many of the Alicorns who have joined us are happy to lend their services when capable. For the most part folks are starting to grow more neutral towards their presence. and like most things in the wasteland, many just shrug their shoulders and keep on keeping on. Still, its odd to find yourself in a medical bed being cared for by a gentle Green Alicorn or four, who seem to know exactly what you want, when you want it.                         Creepy? Yeah... but shockingly effective too."
    
  SLV_Sisters_in_need:0 "Sisters in Need"
  SLV_Sisters_in_need_desc:0 "After some poking and prodding, we've managed to put together several parties of creatures to help intigrate the Alicorns, though one of them has run across a unique issue. The Alicorn they brought in was apparently one of those who had simply collapsed after the Death of the goddess, kept alive only by the gentle applications of magical radiation by one of her 'Sisters'. None would dare tell her that they could do nothing, as that would merely invoke the wrath of a Green... who are known for smashing things with their powerful telekinesis spells. Things nearly came to a head until a doctor passed by with a lucky charm made from magical crystal... which breifly roused the comotose Green. It seems that with the proper application of crystal, they can be revived! Future patrols have been ordered to recover any Alicorns they can find in similar states.... and most curiously, this very obvious act of equine behaviour seems to have chipped at the icy exterior of most ponies. After all, who can still call something a merciless monster when she's crying over the body of her sister?"
    
  SLV_Harmony_in_Motion:0 "Harmony in Motion"
  SLV_Harmony_in_Motion_desc:0 "Helping the Alicorns is the right thing to do, if we don't they might end up settling down amid our hostile neighbors, or worse still, join up with some of the Raider gangs still plaguing the land. Letting them settle among us is the better of two evils. Heck, it might even turn into a positive if handled with care. But preparing to help them will take time, and effort to gather the necesarry materials."
    
  SLV_Demigods_of_War:0 "Goddesses of War"
  SLV_Demigods_of_War_desc:0 "Normally its not unusual for large creatures to volunteer for military service, but having a trio of Alicorns strapped with enough armor plating to make a Steel Ranger jealous come marching... barging really, into a recruiters office and ask for a chance to serve in the way they know best... well, are you going to tell the towering mare carrying a pair of battle-saddle mounted Grenade Machineguns 'No'? Of course not. Though it seems this single act has acted as a tidal wave of sorts, as many of the Alicorns who previously were providing simple services have begun coming forward to offer their services. Be it as mercenaries, as soldiers, medics, scouts, and communications officers. The requests are becoming so frequent in fact, that we're being forced to consider forming specialized units for Alicorns. Further more, the willingness to protect our people seems to have finally helped melt the hearts of those who opposed the intigration of Alicorns into our society. Some may not like it, but they're becoming the minority."

Be it news and interesting stories, warnings of attack, or simple general messages between local leaders. Investing time and Caps into improving such a system will win us alot of good will among the population, and spread the word to the wasteland: 'We are here, we are established, and we are capable.'

The Powerful Stingwings of the North, the Red Rabbits of the Southern Shores, and beyond them their occasional ally in the Stormlands. Each are dangerous alone, and its only through our strength that keeps the Raiders from moving in great force against the last walls of South Shore, or storming Stable Phi."
        
  SLV_FuckAroundFindOut:0 "A Great Risk"
  SLV_FuckAroundFindOut_desc:0 "In the last Decade the Raiders of the North and South have grown bolder in their raids, and worse still... they have been growing stronger, year by year. Unless we take action soon they will likely strike and over-run not only us, but our close partners in the region. We must act to sunder at least one of these large Raider Bands, though any move we make against one side will surely provoke the other into attacking.  Whatever we choose to do, we must be ready. Failure is not an option!"
          
  SLV_to_the_Dead_Plains:0 "...to the Dead Plains"
  SLV_to_the_Dead_Plains_desc:0 "If we choose to support South Shore and strike at the Stingwings, the Southern Raiders will likely attack Stable Phi in force. While they can button up to protect themselves for a time, we will have to fight hard and fast to keep the Stingwing's from overrunning our positions. We're going to be sending a pretty clear message with this change in doctrine, and it probably won't take the Raiders down South to put together that they're next, so we should be prepared for them to potentially work together against us."
          
  SLV_Our_Friends_From_Beyond:0 "For our Friends from Beyond!"
  SLV_Our_Friends_From_Beyond_desc:0 "Attacking the Southern Raiders is going to be a difficult task to be certain, the biggest issue being the Canterine River itself. While we can certainly ford it in boats, we won't be able to focus as heavily on the Northern Raiders, leaving them to run amuck near South Shore. While they may have some amazing laser weapons, those walls of theres won't hold up long against determined Raiders. In addition, the odds of the Rabbits and the Stormlanders working together is concerningly high, especially if rumors of their bosses courting in secret is true."

  SLV_Across_The_River:0 "...and Across The River!"
  SLV_Across_The_River_desc:0 "We should have known that the Stormriders and the Rabbits would take advantage of our lapse in focus. Shifting resources back to the South will take time, and theres no telling if the T'Doshan surface facilities will survive until we can launch a counter-attack. Even if they don't, we'll finish these Raiders Once and For All!"

  SLV_Marching_North:0 "...and our Friends across the River!"
  SLV_Marching_North_desc:0 "The Stingwing's are overrunning South Shore, if they haven't done so already. We MUST mount a counterattack as soon as we can. Every second wasted means the destruction of invaluable Pre-War and Wartime knowledge. For the sake of a better future, WE MUST MARCH!"

  SLV_TalonOperationsHub_desc:0 "After a signifigant amount of effort, a local branch of Talon Mercenaries has been established within our territory, with some oversight to ensure the contracts issued don't bring them into conflict with our interests."

  SLV_TheGoodBois:0 "The Good Boi's"
  SLV_TheGoodBois_desc:0 "Including Diamond Dogs and Sand Dogs in leadership positions among our frontline forces has proven suprisingly effective, especially for units required to rapidly fortify locations!"

  SLV_MiraclesApples:0 "Miracles Apples"
  SLV_MiraclesApples_idea_desc:0 "While it may not have been intentional, the irresponsible actions of Dr. Horny Miracle have contaminated a bountiful portion of farmland soil with an extermely long lasting, minor aprodisiac. Though there are no negative effects outside of the obvious, it has contaminated the food grown at that particular farm. Rather than clear out the contaminated soil, the orchard owner simply started marking their Apples for 'Adult Consumption Only", and raising the price slightly... and the worst part is, Her Profits margins AND our population seem to be on the rise.  

  SLV_EverythingTreeOrchards:0 "The Breakfast Club 'Everything Tree' Orchards"
  SLV_EverythingTreeOrchards_desc:0 "Originally designed in a Stable to enable a variety of fruit choices for residents while minimizing Light requirements, the Everything Tree outwardly appears to be a simple Apple Tree. The Difference is in the fruit it bears, that being one of 34 different types, with no tree being exactly the same beyond: Apples, Pears, Bannana, Oranges, Mango, Red Grapes, Green Grapes, Lemons, and Strawberries. Beyond these standards the tree's produce a seemingly unlimited variety. With enough trees, every fruit one could imagine might be just a market-trip away."

  SLV_MercifulGoddess:0 "Merciful Goddess's"
  SLV_MercifulGoddess_desc:0 "Alicorns have integrated themselves into non-combat services, such as medical, mail, merchantile and exploratory. But the one most will recall is the Medical profession, as many have chosen to simply wear the pony-sized labcoats and nurses caps rather than get personalized outfits made to their scale."

  SLV_SkyfighterProgram:0 "Skyfighter Program"
  SLV_SkyfighterProgram_desc:0 "Initially designed for the purpose of creating anti-spiritual armor, for engaging Legion Battle-Shamans during the Great War, these days the Skyfighter program facilities iare used for Material testing and research."

  SLV_DemigoddessofWar_desc:0 "When it comes to heavy firepower, few can out-do that of an Alicorn. Now that they are included in military formations the amount of firepower each unit has is signifigantly improved."

  SLV_HerosintheShatteredSky_desc:0 "The skies lie broken and open, Even guarded by the Enclave, the pilots of the Alliance are all to a mare willing to take to the skies to ensure that the Enclave's claim to control is both 'Past Tense' and 'Deeply Contested' Its a good day in the Alliance!"

  SLV_RootsofaDeadTree_desc:0 "This region has been affected by the machinations of Long Dead designers, and more recently by the actions of Wasteland Heroes working with Wandering Sunrise of Stable 43, and her Renegade Companion Martini Markerlight; who's effects have been felt over the last two decades. " 

  SLV_BountyOfTDosh:0 "The Bounty of T'Dosh"
  SLV_BountyOfTDosh_desc:0 "While the machinery of Stable Phi was initially designed for the purpose of etching and engraving extremely high quality artificial gemstones for use in Project Nackenbart, the T'Doshan scientists and engineers who took over have adapted them for many more mundane tasks by their standards. By our standards though this is easily a league or two ahead of even the most advanced labs of the old MoAS. The gem matrixize produced here are of such quality that even lower end machines utilizing them are vastly improved. Everything from our primative detection equipment to factory computers. It is truely out of this World!"
