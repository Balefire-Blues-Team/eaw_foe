tribal_past:0 "Our Culture"

tribal.1.t:0 "A Distant Memory"
tribal.1.d:0 "Long before the Great War, Equestria was a beacon of harmony and peace. Their ideals went on to shape the world as a whole, as they became one of the strongest nations to ever exist. However, their power was challenged by another nation, one built on militaristic expansion: Zebrica. This would result in a war that spanned continents, which could only be brought to an end by such widescale death and destruction that we're still living in the aftermath to this day. \n \n This terrible and horrible war would be what led our ancestors to forming our tribe. When they set about forming our tribe, there were several competing visions for our future in mind. Some called for them to hold on to the Equestrian ideals that they had grown up and lived with. Others pointed out how well that went and instead called for them to mimic the clear victor in the war, the zebras. And yet another group instead proposed that they look at the griffons, who did nothing but profit off of both sides. Though their arguments raged on for quite a long time, they did eventually conclude to make one ideal the basis for their society."
tribal.1.a:0 "Harmony, like Equestria of old!"
tribal.1.b:0 "Militarism, like the mighty Zebrican Empire!"
tribal.1.c:0 "Greed, like the griffons."

tribal.2.t:0 "Who are we?"
tribal.2.d:0 "Harmony and peace are the greatest ideals anyone could strive for. Our ancestors knew this, and took it to heart in those early days of our tribe. As the centuries went on, we developed into a peaceful society that doesn't want to bother anyone. As a result of this, our people relied on peaceful ventures to make a living. One field in particular ended up growing to become the most common profession within our tribe and defining us for generations to come."
tribal.2.a:0 "Farming."
tribal.2.b:0 "Trading."
tribal.2.c:0 "Scavenging."

##### Second focus about method how tribe is surviving today, for zebra race
tribal.21.t:0 "Who are we?"
tribal.21.d:0 "Harmony failed. It burned up and perished in the balefire that consumed our world. Our ancestors saw this and decided to abadon the ideal entirely, instead turning to the ideals of those who had defeated it: Zebrica. Their militarism allowed them to unite a continent, establishing themselves as the mightiest empire to ever exist. And do we not desire that? To grow mighty and to conquer all who stand before us? It was decided that this should be our destiny. Over the centuries, we have stayed true to this ideal. Our warriors are honored, with every child dreaming of being one when they grow older. However, one famous warrior went on to drastically shape our tribes culture as a whole."
tribal.21.a:0 "A brave warrior who died a heroic death."
tribal.21.b:0 "A cruel warrior who enslaved his enemeies."
tribal.21.c:0 "A popular war chief who cemented his power."

##### Second focus about method how tribe is survivng today, for griffon race

tribal.22.t:0 "Who are we?"
tribal.22.d:0 "As the foolish nations of Equestria and Zebrica waged war upon one another, a third side gazed on with interest. This interest was spurred by the potential for profit, which they quickly exploited for all it was worth. Griffon mercenaries fought on both sides, just as griffon guns were sold to the highest bidder and griffon businesses operated out of both nations. Even following the war, the griffons lost little compared to those who had brought ruin to our world. Our ancestors looked upon them and decided that it was only wise to follow their lead, so that we too may prosper and grow rich without risking our own lives. Over the centuries, our tribe has worked hard to amass wealth, and the wealthiest of us has always been honored and respected. How do we go about amassing this wealth though?"
tribal.22.a:0 "We became mercenaries."
tribal.22.b:0 "We traded with those around us."
tribal.22.c:0 "We embraced the slave trade."

tribal.3.t:0 "A Dream of Harmony"
tribal.3.d:0 "You can't survive alone, not in the Wasteland. A group cannot survive without food. A farm can not survive without protection. A guard can not do his job without a weapon. It is all interconnected, with each part serving each other part. Only with everyone helping everyone else can we seek to achieve prosperity and peace. How many must be involved though? Should we keep just to our closeknit village, where everyone knows everyone else? Or do we seek to build a proper nation, one to stand as an example of harmony and peace? Perhaps we can go even further, making it our goal to be the new saviors of the world and all who inhabit it."
tribal.3.a:0 "We will stick to our small village."
tribal.3.b:0 "We will become a beacon of harmony."
tribal.3.c:0 "We will save the Wasteland!"

##### third focus about how tribe is prospering nowadays and what it's people is dreaming of 
tribal.31.t:0 "The Pursuit of Profit"
tribal.31.d:0 "As our wealth grew, the ideal of harmony that we had once followed grew more and more distant. All that seemed to matter was profit, and the pursuit thereof. Friendship and peace became only conditions through which profit could be achieved, and our people increasingly forgot themselves as the years went by. That is, until a respected merchant tried to set us on the right path. They appealed to their tribe by speaking of the ideals of our ancestors, promising that we could still profit but in a way that would be more in line with what our founders had envisioned. Another merchant challenged them, claiming that we are not going anywhere near far enough in our pursuit of profit. Our tribe was torn between the two, but eventually a consensus was reached."
tribal.31.a:0 "Honest wealth is where it's at."
tribal.31.b:0 "The pursuit of profit is the most noble one."

tribal.321.d:0 "Fire, that's what the world was cleansed with. Now it is nothing more than a giant arena for our warriors to test themselves in. Even now, those who come of age journey out into the Wasteland. Those that return often bare scars of their first kill showing they're worthy of being in our tribe.\n\nSome of us have questioned what kind of warriors we should be. Our warriors prove themselves early, surely they would be able to conquer the wasteland. Yet, a wise warrior will know when they're outmatched, we will keep to ourselves and defend ourselves against any aggressor.\n\nBut many of our warriors remember glory of the past from the stories and legends about the mightiest empire - Zebrica and about it's invincable legions. Maybe we should search for remnants of it in the Wasteland and restore our honor by rejoining it... Or we can create our own new legion so everyone can see our might and glory."
tribal.321.a:0 "We shall conquer the Wasteland!"

tribal.322.t:0 "The Most Valuable Commodity"
tribal.322.d:0 "Slavery has been a great boon to us. Why should our own people toil away when we can force our enemies to do so for us? However, we were not the only ones to see the potential in slavery. All across the Wasteland, countless nations have begun to take slaves. Many of them have had interesting ideas on how to handle them, such as forcing them to fight or trading them for profit. Perhaps we could learn from these examples?"
tribal.322.a:0 "They shall fight for us! Better they die than our warriors."
tribal.322.b:0 "We shall get involved in the slave trade."
tribal.322.c:0 "We must use them to fuel our industry."

tribal.323.d:0 "One of our oddest War Chiefs sought to turn us from a simple band of warriors into something much more. Towards this end, they pursued all sorts of methods of improving our capabilities. From chems to slave labor, he experimented with many different things. This became their obsession and sole pursuit until the day they died. Following their death, the next War Chief decided to honor his legacy by continuing one of his pursuits."

tribal.332.t:0 "Profit or honour?"
tribal.332.d:0 "As our wealth grew, the methods we used grew more and more cruel. All that seemed to matter was profit, and the pursuit thereof. Common morals and decency were thrown to the wayside, giving way for pure unfiltered greed. That is, until a respected merchant tried to set us on the right path. They appealed to their tribe by speaking of the ideals of our ancestors, promising that we could still profit but in a way that would be more in line with what our founders had envisioned. Another merchant challenged them, claiming that we are not going anywhere near far enough in our pursuit of profit. Our tribe was torn between the two, but eventually a consensus was reached."

All across the Wasteland, countless nations have begun to take slaves. Many of them have had interesting ideas on how to handle them, such as forcing them to fight or having them labor away in workshops to produce things. Perhaps we could learn from these examples?"
tribal.333.a:0 "We'll force them to fight to protect us."

tribal.4.d:0 "Great powers are stirring all across the Wasteland. We must begin modernizing our tribe, unless we wish to be swallowed up by a foreign nation. However, our tribe is divided on how to go about this. The warriors call for us to work on ensuring that they are supplied, focusing on the development of weapons workshops and expanding their ranks. Many of the non-warriors within our tribe have a much different idea in mind, one based on peaceful trade and and economic development."
