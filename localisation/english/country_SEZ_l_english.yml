SEZ_NVR_explain_tt:0 "§YThe §cNovaya Rodina§!, or as they are called in full §cArmy for the restoration of the glorious Motherland§!, are a group of Marksists, Anarchists and Socialists lead by §cAmaryll Ponekoek§!, a General from Sladkyi.\nThey are made up from the descendants and remnants of the reconquest-effort the communists and their Zebra allies attempted at the end of the great war.\nLong were they scattered in cells and homesteads, but now they have united again to reclaim Stalliongrad, and the entire Motherland.\n§RThe Second Revolution has begun!§!§!"
SEZ_RST_explain_tt:0 "§YThe §RRed Stalkers§! are one of the more infamous Raider-warbands in Severyana. Unlike others, they have never sought to control territory, instead roaming the land, despoiling and plundering where-ever they go.\nThey are lead by the self-proclaimed §CPhilosopher-Raider§! §R'Punt'§! who has made it their mission to build a new kind of pony, unbound from the weakness and excess of the old world. Unlike most others, they are not in Princessyn for some old claim, but simply because they can, and §Rit is the law of the wastes, that if you can take something, you must!§!§!"
SEZ_LEE_explain_tt:0 "§YBeaten and battered, the §NLegionary Expedition§! has barely survived their first day in Princessyn. They were unprepared for the number and skill of foes they fought, and have been beaten back.\nWith §NGeneral Zariman§! and most of high-command dead by the hooves of §Rthe Raider 'Punt'§! it now falls to §NCommander Zirell Fortis§! to save the expedition and turn their fortunes around. For while they have suffered greatly, they are still the most skilled soldiers here, and as they once did in the deserts of Zebrica, the Legions will prevail in bringing civilization to this godless land.\n§OFor the Fallen Ceasar!§!§!"

severyana.4.a:0 "Concerning"

severyana.5.t:0 "Critical Systems Failiure"
severyana.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Reactor powering the Zone finally burns through the last safety measures and melts itself, along with a good amount of the Administration-Tower's lower levels. Minutes later, the emergency batteries are diverted to power other systems, leading to the Zone that dominated Princessyn for 200 years finally collapsing. It's only a matter of time until ponies realize they can enter the City."
severyana.5.a:0 "Initiate emergency operations"

severyana.6.t:0 "The Zone has Fallen"
severyana.6.d:0 "WIP\n\nAt long last, the Magical Zone that has prevented exploration and settlement of Princessyn has fallen. Recent reports from daredevils and bordering communities confirm that while the mutants and ghouls remain, the magical effect that drove ponies in the city insane is gone, hopefully for good. Already, the more adventurous or ambitious are preparing to head for Princessyn, to stake their claims on whatever wonders the city might hold."
severyana.6.a:0 "I wonder what the city holds..."
severyana.6.b:0 "Call General Zeriman, We have a mission for him!"
severyana.6.c:0 "At last, we can reclaim the Capital"
severyana.6.e:0 "Send a Signal to the cells, our time has come!"
severyana.6.f:0 "I wonder if we can profit from this?"

severyana.7.t:0 "General Zerimans Expedition"
severyana.7.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Legionary Council decides to charge General Zariman with leading an expedition into Princessyn, to claim it for the Legions and the Zebra Empire. At long last, we have the opportunity to fulfill our objective. While the other Legions have promised to pitch in some troops and equipment, we will have to shoulder most of the burden... though that also means we will get to reap most of the reward, if our expedition prevails."
severyana.7.a:0 "Glory to the fallen Ceasar"

severyana.8.t:0 "The living Dream"
severyana.8.d:0 "WIP\n\nOur General, Amaryll Ponekoek, has long been an ardent believer in a second revolution for Severyana. She has gathered a large chunk of the various remnant-cells from the attempted re-conquest of Stalliongrade near the end of the great war around herself, and is planning on marching on Princessyn. Even among our own military, such an expidition has great support, making it basically impossible to refuse. While we will be weakened in the short term, if Ponekoek's so called §RNovaya Rodina§! succeed in claiming Severyana, we will surely benefit greatly."
severyana.8.a:0 "Let's show the world that Marksism isn't dead!"

severyana.9.t:0 "Syndicate Calling"
severyana.9.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Scrapper Syndicate, the largest international Organization in Severyana, has come to us with a very lucrative contract, and a heavy implication that we are not to refuse. The Syndicate owns many of the scavenging and resource-gathering operations our country and surrounding nations, and now that the Zone is down, they seem to have set their eyes on Princessyn. They are offering us triple pay in both caps and resources, for a very perilous expedition into the City. We would be expected to send a Talon-company with them, and continuously supply reinforcements so long as the contract is active. Talon units are to be under their sole command, though as a gesture of good faith, they are willing to leave us lines of communications with our units."
severyana.9.a:0 "The deal of the century!"

severyana.11.t:0 "Like Flies to a Carcass"
severyana.11.d:0 "WIP\n\nPrincessyn is swarming with new ponies. Lone explorers and small bands of raiders and scavengers have entered the city. This is quickly replaced, as organized groups make their move. First are the Zebras, who send a sizable Expedition by river. They establish tenuous control over much of the Northbank, but are surprised by the Novaya Rodina attacking en masse. Outnumbered, the Zebras fall back further into the city, and the Novaya burn the Zebra's transports. Suddenly, a third group enters from No Ponies Land. A raider-gang called the Red Stalkers takes the Zebras from behind, managing to kill off much of their command structure and pinning them in Central Princessyn. None of the three are able to wipe eachother out on the first day, and an uneasy ceasefire settles."

severyana.12.t:0 "Old Foes"
severyana.12.d:0 "WIP\n\nWhile on the Northside, ponies that have never even seen Princessyn stream in, seeking to claim it, the Southside featured more familiar faces. First amongst them was Umbral Zap and his usual crew of Disciples. They had attempted to enter the city half a dozen times already in the years prior, only to take horrific losses each attempt. This time, however, the Disciples are backed by a large force of Scrapper Syndicate personell, as well as a full Talon Company. They make short work of the thin Novaya Rodina lines on the Southbank, and push them back to the Jzemroc Bridges. However, just as everything seemed to be going well, reports from foes in the underground Metro stopped their advance. Ghouls wearing old Equestrian Uniforms were spilling forth from hidden bunkers and the labirinthine Metro tunnels of Princessyn. They moved with seasoned professionalism, and proved to be a match to even the Talon Company. The Advance of the Ghoul SOldiers was stopped, but the Disciples and their allies had lost their momentum, deciding to cede some ground to the Novaya Rodina to strengthen their lines against this new foe.\nMeanwhile, all over the city, Robots are making their way towards the Administration tower, where the AI that ruled Princessyn for 2 centuries prepares to get it's city back under control."
