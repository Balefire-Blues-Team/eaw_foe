severyana.5.t:0 "Critical Systems Failiure"
severyana.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Reactor powering the Zone finally burns through the last safety measures and melts itself, along with a good amount of the Administration-Tower's lower levels. Minutes later, the emergency batteries are diverted to power other systems, leading to the Zone that dominated Princessyn for 200 years finally collapsing. It's only a matter of time until ponies realize they can enter the City."

severyana.6.t:0 "The Zone has Fallen"
severyana.6.d:0 "WIP\n\nAt long last, the Magical Zone that has prevented exploration and settlement of Princessyn has fallen. Recent reports from daredevils and bordering communities confirm that while the mutants and ghouls remain, the magical effect that drove ponies in the city insane is gone, hopefully for good. Already, the more adventurous or ambitious are preparing to head for Princessyn, to stake their claims on whatever wonders the city might hold."

severyana.7.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Legionary Council decides to charge General Zariman with leading an expedition into Princessyn, to claim it for the Legions and the Zebra Empire. At long last, we have the opportunity to fulfill our objective. While the other Legions have promised to pitch in some troops and equipment, we will have to shoulder most of the burden... though that also means we will get to reap most of the reward, if our expedition prevails."
severyana.7.a:0 "Glory to the fallen Ceasar"

severyana.8.t:0 "The living Dream"
severyana.8.d:0 "Amaryll Ponekoek once more gestured toward the maps strewn across the table the council used for their debate.\n§c'And this is precisely why NOW is the time to strike! The Zone has fallen, Princessyn is ours for the taking, you must see that...'§! Her voice took on a pleading tone as she slowly ran out of arguments to get the other council members on her side. When she had started her speech, she had demonstratively placed her voting-token on the table already, but so far none of the other 4 had joined theirs to her vote.\nAmaryll's gaze flicked over to Gorri, studying the off-white griffon as he drank from a plastic cup. She knew his vote was safe, they had spoken before the meeting. Next to him sat Milkeyes, an Ghoul mare, who Amaryll was reasonably sure she could convince. But Longbarrel and Tricksy Trott? One as stubborn as a Protectapony, and the other too careful for his own good.\n§c'Friends, we are talking about nothing less than a continuation of the Revolution! At long last, we have the chance to fulfill the dream of our forebearers. Princessyn should be the only thing on our minds, not trade disputes or farming-quotas!'§!\nLongbarrel appeared bored and Tricksy seemed more wary with every word she spoke. Fine, crack Milkeyes first then.\n§c'Right now, as we speak and squabble here, hundreds, nay, thousands of our comrades are already making their way to the city. They are leaving behind farms and families to once more take up arms. They will not rest until the Red Banner of Marksism flies over every building, and neither should we! Do you want to let our comrades waste their lives? Do you still want to pretend we are fighting a war against a government that has been dead and gone for centuries?'§! Amaryll had almosts transitioned into shouting, but centered herself again. A cursory glance Milkeyes' expression gave her hope that the Ghoul was convinced. The finishing blow then. Tricksy wouldn't hold up a decision without anypony backing him.\n§c'If you will not make a move, then we let others decide the future of Severyana. Who should that be? Should we bow to the Imperialists of Petershoof? Align ourselves with Ghoulish facade of Communism that rules this so called New Stalliongrad? Or just continue on here, content that we are not starving, that we have ONE FUCKING FACTORY. And think of that as an achievement?'§! She had Longbarrels attention now.\n§c'I say fuck that! This is our hour to shine, and I intend to personally lead anycreature willing to fight for our cause. We can reclaim our motherland, the birthplace of Communism. Thus, we shall be: §RThe Army for the reclamation of the Glorious Motherland!§!'§!\n§C'That's one beakfull'§! Gorri threw in, as planned. §c'You are right, we could...'§! but Tricksy interrupted §d'Why is it in euqestrian? You claim so much to inherit some legacy, yet you name yourself in the language of our oppressors.'§! Amaryll's mind raced, this was entirely unexpected. After a few seconds, a smile spread across her face.\n§c'Then we shall be the §R'Novaya Rodina'§!! Short, snappy and Severyanan.'§!\nGorri threw his token to the table §C'Hurrah for the Novaya Rodina!'§! Milkeyes' and Longbarrels tokens joined soon. And, slowly, reluctantly, Tricksy pushed his token to the middle, looking all too unhappy."

severyana.9.t:0 "Syndicate Calling"
severyana.9.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Scrapper Syndicate, the largest international Organization in Severyana, has come to us with a very lucrative contract, and a heavy implication that we are not to refuse. The Syndicate owns many of the scavenging and resource-gathering operations our country and surrounding nations, and now that the Zone is down, they seem to have set their eyes on Princessyn. They are offering us triple pay in both caps and resources, for a very perilous expedition into the City. We would be expected to send a Talon-company with them, and continuously supply reinforcements so long as the contract is active. Talon units are to be under their sole command, though as a gesture of good faith, they are willing to leave us lines of communications with our units."
severyana.9.a:0 "The deal of the century!"

severyana.11.t:0 "Like Flies to a Carcass"
severyana.11.d:0 "WIP\n\nPrincessyn is swarming with new ponies. Lone explorers and small bands of raiders and scavengers have entered the city. This is quickly replaced, as organized groups make their move. First are the Zebras, who send a sizable Expedition by river. They establish tenuous control over much of the Northbank, but are surprised by the Novaya Rodina attacking en masse. Outnumbered, the Zebras fall back further into the city, and the Novaya burn the Zebra's transports. Suddenly, a third group enters from No Ponies Land. A raider-gang called the Red Stalkers takes the Zebras from behind, managing to kill off much of their command structure and pinning them in Central Princessyn. None of the three are able to wipe eachother out on the first day, and an uneasy ceasefire settles."

severyana.12.t:0 "Old Foes"
severyana.12.d:0 "WIP\n\nWhile on the Northside, ponies that have never even seen Princessyn stream in, seeking to claim it, the Southside featured more familiar faces. First amongst them was Umbral Zap and his usual crew of Disciples. They had attempted to enter the city half a dozen times already in the years prior, only to take horrific losses each attempt. This time, however, the Disciples are backed by a large force of Scrapper Syndicate personell, as well as a full Talon Company. They make short work of the thin Novaya Rodina lines on the Southbank, and push them back to the Jzemroc Bridges. However, just as everything seemed to be going well, reports from foes in the underground Metro stopped their advance. Ghouls wearing old Equestrian Uniforms were spilling forth from hidden bunkers and the labirinthine Metro tunnels of Princessyn. They moved with seasoned professionalism, and proved to be a match to even the Talon Company. The Advance of the Ghoul SOldiers was stopped, but the Disciples and their allies had lost their momentum, deciding to cede some ground to the Novaya Rodina to strengthen their lines against this new foe.\nMeanwhile, all over the city, Robots are making their way towards the Administration tower, where the AI that ruled Princessyn for 2 centuries prepares to get it's city back under control."

Of course, the Ghouls resist, and it ends up in a shootout where the Robots gun them down. The AI reclassifies the Ghouls as zebrican collaborators for legal reasons, and then uses the combat-experience to generate some new AI-personas to pilot more robots."

Multiple server-nodes responsible for critical functions have experienced a severe offline status, compromising our ability to maintain optimal operations and ensure the safety of Princessyn.\n\nCompounding this issue, unidentified lifeforms have infiltrated our city premises, triggering a state of high alert.

Our technical teams are mobilizing to restore functionality to the affected server-nodes and investigate the nature of the unknown entities.\n\nWe understand the uncertainty and inconvenience caused by this unfortunate incident, and we assure you that every effort is being made to restore normalcy and protect the well-being of all residents. Citizens are advised to stay indoors, refrain from engaging with the unidentified lifeforms, and await further updates from ADM_1033_N-AI/MAS.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your cooperation during this challenging time.
