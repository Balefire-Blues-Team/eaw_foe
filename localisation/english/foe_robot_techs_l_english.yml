 ###Technologies###
 
 robot_simple_ai_tech:0 "Simple AI"
 robot_simple_ai_tech_desc:0 "In the early days of the Great War, the Zebrican Empire adopted the practice of binding nature spirits to their equipment. So long as the spirits were compliant, this method could result in self-operating weaponry. As a counter to this, the recently established Equestrian Ministry of Wartime Technology worked alongside the Ministry of Arcane Sciences worked to develop complex spell-matrixes that could simulate the same effect. Though these matrixes saw limited usage by the Equestrian army, they would go on to be crucial in the development of early computing technology."
 robot_magical_flight_tech:0 "Magical Levitation"
 robot_magical_flight_tech_desc:0 "The invention of magical levitation began with a simple question: What if non-pegasi could fly? Entire armies could fly over the battlefield, descending into Zebrican lines and causing chaos. With this thought in mind, the Ministry of Arcane Sciences went to work creating a levitation talisman that could be mass produced. Unfortunately, after a series of failed trials, they were deemed unsafe for usage by pony forces. Following a comment from Ministry Mare Pinkie Pie regarding making machines fly, the focus of this research shifted towards the fledging field of robotics."
 robot_infiltration_tech:0 "Infiltration Subroutines"
 robot_infiltration_tech_desc:0 "As part of Zebrican infiltration efforts, the smallest robot to ever exist was invented: the humble camerabot. These were essentially just moving cameras, capable of recording and storing audio and video. Unfortunately, these tiny machines were prone to a number of issues. Their inability to remotely transmit information also presented a problem, and after one led Canterlot authorities to a Zebrican listening post, the project was scrapped entirely. However, their programming would be repurposed as part of the Liberator Project."
 robot_deepstrike_tech:0 "Deep-Strike Deployment"
 robot_deepstrike_tech_desc:0 "The Liberator Project ran into endless issues when it came to actually deploying their robots. As Equestrian lines became more fortified, efforts to smuggle anything across them became increasingly difficult. As a solution to this problem, a new form of deployment was devised: large capsules fired from artillery cannons. Actual artillery strikes would accompany them, leading to the Equestrians being none-the-wiser about the robots landing behind their lines."
 robot_lightweight_chassis_tech:0 "Lightweight Chassis"
 robot_lightweight_chassis_tech_desc:0 "As the Great War progressed, a shortage of resources led to many efforts by the Equestrians and Zebricans alike to reduce the amount of material used in production. One of the innovations to come from this was lighter metal alloys, which would go on to widely be used by both nations."
 robot_mini_servos_tech:0 "Miniaturized Servos"
 robot_mini_servos_tech_desc:0 "The Equestrian Ministry of Awesome's first effort to advance Equestrian robotics came in the form of their own flying self-targeting mines. As part of their project to develop these 'Thunderbots', they were forced to find ways to minimize the size of most of the components. The project would never be seen all the way through, as the Ministry turned its focus to developing power armor instead. However, their miniaturized components would become widely used in later Equestrian machinery and robotics."
 robot_efs_integration_tech:0 "EFS-Integration"
 robot_efs_integration_tech_desc:0 "Stable-Tec's 'Eyes Forward Sparkle' was developed as part of their Pipbuck Program. It allowed for easy friend-foe identification, being capable of even gauging hostile intent. This was considered to be a vast improvement over the more primitive Friend Identification Matrix, which was easily fooled and occasionally led to friendly fire. As a result, the EFS system would be quickly integrated into most Equestrian robotics."
 robot_hacking_tech:0 "Combat Hacking-Suite"
 robot_hacking_tech_desc:0 "As terminals became increasingly commonplace, they also became increasingly tempting targets for the Zebrican Empire. Hacking would become an increasingly desired skillset of infiltration specialists, and many later Zebrican espionage operations would be based entirely around targeting information devices. However, a shortage of skilled infiltrators was always a problem. To solve this, the Liberator Project purposed an innovative solution: robots capable of hacking terminals. This would become one of the primary appeals of the Final Wave Liberators, securing a lot of funding for their development."
 robot_organic_protec_tech:0 "Organic-Protection Subroutines"
 robot_organic_protec_tech_desc:0 "As robots became increasingly commonplace on the battlefield, the Equestrian Ministry of Peace sought to find ways to improve their ability to save the lives of Equestrian soldiers. This led to a joint effort between the MoP and the Ministry of Wartime Technology to ensure that all military robotics prioritized saving friendly lives over any other task."
 robot_command_ident_tech:0 "Command Identification Network"
 robot_command_ident_tech_desc:0 "One of the last innovations of the Liberator Project before they rolled out the Final Wave Liberators was the development of Command Identification Network, or CIN, technology. This allowed their robots to identify and communicate the estimated ranks of each individual target. This allowed them to prioritize the elimination of Equestrian officers, throwing the chain of command into disarray."
 robot_empathy_tech:0 "Targeted Empathy-Array"
 robot_empathy_tech_desc:0 "The Liberator Project proved its usefulness to Zebrica once more through developing emotion-based targeting software. This would become widely used by Zebrican robotics to conduct attacks intended to incite panic within Equestrian soldiers. At around the same time, the Equestrian Ministry of Peace developed their own version of this technology intended to make robots more capable of responding appropriately to distressed ponies."
 robot_combat_ai_tech:0 "Automated Turrets"
 robot_combat_ai_tech_desc:0 "After falling on hard times, BronCo Security sought a new innovative solution to it's financial problems. This solution would come in the form of stationary automated turrets, capable of dealing with even the most determined of trespassers. This proved to be a massive success, with BronCo even securing a number of high-paying government contracts. Following their success in this field, BronCo would rebrand to RobronCo, and would focus entirely on the field of robotics."
 robot_flamethrower_tech:0 "Flamer Integration"
 robot_flamethrower_tech_desc:0 "Fire has proven to be a highly effective method of dealing with organic life since the beginning of time. With this in mind, the Zebrican Empire pursued a number of flame-based weapons. As part of this effort, the Inferno Project pushed for the integration of flamers into Zebrican robotics. These were very effective at demoralizing Equestrian soldiers, but drew heavy criticism from more moderate elements within the Zebrican Legion as being unnecessarily sadistic."
 robot_magical_armour_tech:0 "Repair Talismans"
 robot_magical_armour_tech_desc:0 "Repair talismans had been used within Zebrica for generations prior to the War, often used to help protect secure dwellings or to create self-repairing equipment. The earliest Equestrian version of a repair talisman was actually invented by Arcane Dynamics and were intended to be integrated into industrial machinery. These were relatively primitive, but would lead to a later joint effort between the Ministry of Arcane Sciences and the Ministry of Wartime Technology to develop talismans for Equestrian vehicles, power armor, and robotics."
 robot_organic_processor_tech:0 "Organic Processors"
 robot_organic_processor_tech_desc:0 "The concept of organic processors was first developed by the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. They theorized that a living brain could be used as a computing processor, though this theory was never put into practice by their Ministry. Instead, the idea was picked up and pursued by Arcane Dynamics. Thanks to their efforts, the brains of animals were turned into usable processors, with every single terminal within their headquarters being replaced with their new proprietary organic-backed ones." 
 robot_improved_thrusters_tech:0 "Improved Thrusters"
 robot_improved_thrusters_tech_desc:0 "There existed a brief time in the Great War when the Ministry of Awesome tried to counter the Zebrican Liberators by developing their own robots designed to be dropped behind enemy lines. Just like their earlier 'Thunderbot', this effort ended up being abandoned. Before the project was defunded, they did manage to develop a new model of thruster intended to allow their robots to move much faster than their competition."
 robot_cqc_tech:0 "CQC Optimization"
 robot_cqc_tech_desc:0 "Though the Liberator Project would remain the star of Zebrican robotics development, it would not go without competition. Another lesser-known project would see to the development of robots specifically designed for close quarters engagements. This departure from the traditional mid-ranged robotic soldiers would require a number of both design and programming changes to make them better suited for getting up close and personal with the enemy."
 robot_targeting_software_tech:0 "Rapid Targeting Software"
 robot_targeting_software_tech_desc:0 "The Ministry of Awesome's high speed attacks would lead to the Zebrican Legions developing more sophisticated anti-air cannons. As part of their efforts, a new targeting system was devised which would allow each cannon to identify and attack airborne targets far quicker than they could before. This improved targeting software would then go on to be integrated into Zebrican robots."
 robot_medic_tech:0 "Auto-Doc Programming"
 robot_medic_tech_desc:0 "A shortage of qualified medical personnel led to the Ministry of Peace pursuing forms of automated healing. This would ultimately lead to the later models of Auto-Doc, which could operate without any pony input or oversight. However, another solution was pursued prior to those: Robots specifically programmed to provide medical aid. Many different robots would be developed during this time, from the simplistic Med-Bot to the bug-prone Doctor Handy."
 robot_impact_chassis_tech:0 "Impact Resistant Chassis"
 robot_impact_chassis_tech_desc:0 "For a brief time, Zebrica and Equestria began to compete in trying to make the sturdiest robots possible. Many failed models would be produced across both nations, but several of the improvements made upon armor design would stick for the rest of the War."
 robot_special_alloys_tech:0 "Complex Alloys"
 robot_special_alloys_tech_desc:0 "Many new metal alloys were invented during the course of the Great War, with many of them becoming crucial to the war effort in both Equestria and Zebrica. A number of these would be invented solely for usage in robotics production, maximizing protection while still trying to minimize the weight of the robots themselves."
 robot_emp_resistance_tech:0 "EMP Shielding"
 robot_emp_resistance_tech_desc:0 "Equestrian pulse weaponry and Zebrican shock weaponry rendered military robotics near entirely useless during a brief point in the Great War. This time would last less than a month before all military electronics became commonly shielded against any form of electromagnetic interference. Robotics would quickly become even more relevant to the war effort than before this, as the sheer casualties forced both sides to begin supplementing their forces with even more robots."
 robot_military_circuits_tech:0 "Military-Grade Circuitry"
 robot_military_circuits_tech_desc:0 "A lot of the circuits used within military robots were fragile, relying entirely on outer armor to protect them. The Ministry of Wartime Technology sought to change this, developing much more durable circuitry that was much less likely to snap or otherwise break under pressure."
 robot_positronics_tech:0 "Positronic Processors"
 robot_positronics_tech_desc:0 "In the only cooperative effort ever attempted between Arcane Dynamics and RobronCo, an experimental processor utilizing positron particles was developed to allow terminals and robots to process information substantially faster. This joint venture would fall through over disagreements regarding the financing of this project, with each company going on to develop their own versions of the product."
 robot_mirco_sun_tech:0 "Micro-Sun Containment Reactor"
 robot_mirco_sun_tech_desc:0 "As Equestria's robotics industry advanced, so too did their methods of energy storage. The earlier crystal batteries found themselves replaced by larger arcane cells, but even those weren't enough to power the largest robots developed towards the end of the War. An unlikely company would be the one to purpose a solution to the ongoing energy problem: Solar Services, a solar power company largely based within Equestria's deserts. With funding from both the Ministry of Wartime Technology and the Ministry of Arcane Sciences, they developed miniature contained stars as a power source."
 robot_adv_matrix_tech:0 "Sentient Spell Matrices"
 robot_adv_matrix_tech_desc:0 "In the final few years of the Great War, Equestria and Zebrica entered an 'AI Race'. Both sides sought to beat the other in creating sentient thinking machines, with the hope of such giving them a sizable edge over their opponent. One of the major advancements made as part of this was a complex spell matrix that was capable of simulating sentient thought. This technology would become widely used within the newest Equestrian robotics by the end of the War."
 robot_magical_shields_tech:0 "Arcane Displacement Shields"
 robot_magical_shields_tech_desc:0 "During the Great War, the Crystal Empire spent most of its time devising new methods to defend Equestrian soldiers from harm. As part of their efforts, the Shining Armor Research Grant was used to fund a variety of efforts to develop superior shielding spells. The result of this would ultimately be the Crystal University's Arcane Displacement Shield (ADS), a very non-traditional shield that functioned more like a teleportation field, displacing any projectiles fired at it."
 robot_cooling_tech:0 "Heat Recycling Spellcircuits"
 robot_cooling_tech_desc:0 "One of the largest challenges faced by Project Cider was the issue of overheating. The solution to this problem would actually be presented by a Zebrican defector, who presented schematics to Equestria for a system capable of taking excess heat and converting it directly into usable energy. This system would become crucial to further development of the Ultra Sentinel."
 robot_mini_ammo_tech:0 "5th Dimensional Ammo Storage"
 robot_mini_ammo_tech_desc:0 "This innovation would not come from a well-funded thinktank or a prestigious Zebrican research program, but would rather come from Ministry Mare Pinkie Pie. During a mental binge, she went to work drawing up a truly massive schematic with icing on a cake canvas. This schematic was then presented to the Ministry of Arcane Sciences top researchers during a 'Celebrating-Smart-Ponies' party. None of them could understand what they were seeing, but upon following the schematic, a new form of vastly enlarged ammo storage was invented."
 robot_good_targeting_tech:0 "Hive Linked AI Minds"
 robot_good_targeting_tech_desc:0 "One of the last innovations made by the Liberator Project before they rolled out the Jumla-Kifo Frontline Assault Bot was the invention of a new form of robotic networking. Rather than having each robot act as an independent unit, they could instead have them all combine their processing power and effectively think as one unified whole. This would allow divisions of robots to act far more cohesively and effectively."
 robot_direct_rad_tech:0 "Directed Balefire Radiation"
 robot_direct_rad_tech_desc:0 "As understanding of radiation improved, so too did efforts to weaponize it. Though both sides created prototype radiation weaponry, the Zebrican Legion was the only ones to come to widely utilize these weapons. Pressure from a number of Zebrican generals led to a number of the older Zebrican robots being refurbished and equipped with radiation cannons, in order to help demoralize Equestrian forces. "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ###Equipment###
 
 light_robot_clock_equipment:0 "Clockwork Automata"
 light_robot_clock_equipment_desc:0 "The Clockwork Automata were the first major self-thinking machines used within warfare. Rather than being invented by either Equestria or Zebrica, they were instead invented by the infamous griffon engineer Leopold Schmeller. Their first usage was in the brief Barrad-Wittenland War, where they formed the bulk of the Barrad forces. Zebrica would go on to copy the design and use their own automata in the earliest battles of the War."
 light_robot_clock_equipment_short:0 "Clockwork Automata"
 off_support_robot_equipment1:0 "Liberator MKI"
 off_support_robot_equipment1_desc:0 "The Liberator MKI is a purpose-built deep battle and infiltration robot, whose main purpose is the disruption of enemy command-infrastructure and supply-lines. Liberators can close up their chassis to assume the rough form of an artillery-shell, enabling them to be lobbed by standard field-artillery over enemy positions to wreak havoc behind enemy lines. The MKI version was equipped with an ultralight laser-weapon and could additionally use its legs to stab ground bound targets."
 off_support_robot_equipment1_short:0 "Liberator I"
 def_support_robot_equipment1:0 "Guardian"
 def_support_robot_equipment1_desc:0 "One of the earliest robots designed by the then-new Ministry of Wartime Technology, the Guardian was intended to serve as a form of mobile cover rather than actively fight. It was modeled after Equestrian trains, featuring one large headlight on the front and a wedge-bumper, though it moved with treads rather than wheels. It also featured a built-in battle saddle that could have firearms mounted on it."
 def_support_robot_equipment1_short:0 "Guardian"
 def_support_robot_equipment2:0 "Custodian"
 def_support_robot_equipment2_desc:0 "The Custodian was the successor to the Guardian, and was intended to serve as its superior replacement on the battlefield. The outdated train-based design was done away with, the robot instead resembling a giant metal box. It came with built-in heavy weaponry, though it still required ammo to be manually loaded into it between each battle. It would prove to be a very effective design throughout the first half of the Great War, but the advent of anti-machine weaponry quickly rendered it obsolete."
 def_support_robot_equipment2_short:0 "Custodian"
 off_support_robot_equipment2:0 "Liberator MKII"
 off_support_robot_equipment2_desc:0 "The Liberator MKII is the direct successor of the MKI and improves on its strengths, as well as eliminating its biggest weakness. While the MKI was initially successful, it quickly became apparent that the ultralight laser was not enough to fight off even lightly armored opponents. The MKII fixes this by miniaturizing the robots servos as well as the internal reactor, and using the new space to add a simple firing array, capable of using the fearsome stopping-power of an 8-gauge shotgun shell. Sadly, only 5 rounds of ammunition could be fitted into the new chassis, but it still dramatically increased the Liberator's effectiveness."
 off_support_robot_equipment2_short:0 "Liberator II"
 def_support_robot_equipment3:0 "Warden-Droneswarm"
 def_support_robot_equipment3_desc:0 "Into the late War, the Ministry of Wartime Technology sought to create a new successor to the dated Guardian model of robot. At the same time, the Ministry of Peace was working on developing a medical robot that could be used to distribute healing potions to wounded soldiers across the battlefield. This would end with the two Ministries coming together in a joint project to develop a robot capable of doing both. The end result: The Warden-Droneswarm, small spherical robots that could take bullets and provide support in equal measure."
 def_support_robot_equipment3_short:0 "Droneswarm"
 off_support_robot_equipment3:0 "Final Wave Liberator"
 off_support_robot_equipment3_desc:0 "The Final Wave Liberator was designed specifically to fight within the Equestrian jungles, on top of filling the prestablished Liberator role. Each unit boasted a far more complex AI than the earlier Liberator models, with them being capable of devising and carrying out complex tactics. They were also equipped with burrower drills, allowing them to hide beneath the earth and pop out when unsuspecting Equestrians approached. As a counter to Equestrian robotics, they were also equipped with a hacking suite, making them capable of remotely shutting down or even controlling other robots."
 off_support_robot_equipment3_short:0 "FW Liberator"
 light_robot_scrap_equipment:0 "Scrapbot"
 light_robot_scrap_equipment_desc:0 "As the field of robotics progressed, so too did civilian interest in it. This led to the rise of hobbyists who created their own simplistic robots out of household appliances and other simple electronics. Following the devastating end of the War, many scavengers took to trying to build their own robotic companions. Their designs are often much less appealing than those of their hobbyist predecessors, but they more than make up for that in combat potential."
 light_robot_scrap_equipment_short:0 "Scrapbot"
 light_robot_sprite_equipment:0 "Spritebot"
 light_robot_sprite_equipment_desc:0 "The Spritebot was a versatile robot intended for domestic surveillance and security. It was developed as a joint project between the Ministry of Arcane Sciences, the Ministry of Wartime Technology, and the Ministry of Morale. It's simple spherical design and lack of complex components made it easy to mass produce, and the built in radio transmitters allowed it to transmit signals and data over long distances with ease. The Ministry of Morale would come to utilize them extensively."
 light_robot_sprite_equipment_short:0 "Spritebot"
 light_robot_handy_equipment:0 "Mr. Handy"
 light_robot_handy_equipment_desc:0 "Following the success of the Protectapony, RobronCo sought to try to expand from the business market and into the consumer sphere. This expansion would come in the form of the Mr. Handy, a many armed robot that was marketed as being capable of doing all sorts of common household tasks. It proved to be a great success, and production of the Mr. Handy model would continue for the remainder of the War, with RobronCo becoming a household name."
 light_robot_handy_equipment_short:0 "Mr. Handy"
 light_robot_gutsy_equipment:0 "Mr. Gutsy"
 light_robot_gutsy_equipment_desc:0 "Following the widespread success of the Mr. Handy, the Ministry of Wartime Technology contracted RobronCo to make a similar robot for military usage. After a vast number of setbacks and redesigns, the Mr. Gutsy model was finally rolled out. Unfortunately, Zebrican anti-machine capabilities had already rendered the Mr. Gutsy obsolete before it even took the field. As a result, only a few batches would ever be produced."
 light_robot_gutsy_equipment_short:0 "Mr. Gutsy"
 medium_robot_protectapony_equipment:0 "Protectapony"
 medium_robot_protectapony_equipment_desc:0 "The recently rebranded RobronCo sought to go beyond simple automated turrets and create proper security robots. This would result in the Protectapony, a pony-shaped quadruped robot that was equipped with a low-yield recharging arcane laser and an AI capable of basic pathfinding and organic-interactions. These robots would prove a hit, with the first batch selling out within a week."
 medium_robot_protectapony_equipment_short:0 "Protectapony"
 medium_robot_assaultron_equipment:0 "Assaultron"
 medium_robot_assaultron_equipment_desc:0 "In the time between the Final Wave Liberator and the Jumla-Kifo, the Zebrican Empire was in need of a new frontline robot to supplement their own forces. The end result of this would be the Assaultron, a Zebra-shaped robot with a high-powered laser, close quarters weaponry, and built-in stealth capabilities. They would often infiltrate Equestrian fortifications and camps, then attack in the middle of the night, causing chaos."
 medium_robot_assaultron_equipment_short:0 "Assaultron"
 medium_robot_robobrain_equipment:0 "Robobrain"
 medium_robot_robobrain_equipment_desc:0 "As part of their efforts to save lives, the Ministry of Peace attempted to create a system through which a pony brain could be preserved and allowed to interact with the world around them. However, their innovations would quickly come to be repurposed to wage war, as Arcane Dynamics developed their own combat robots utilizing organic brains as processors. Fatally injured soldiers and prisoners of war alike would have their brains put in these robots during the last year of the War, before being sent back out to the front lines."
 medium_robot_robobrain_equipment_short:0 "Robobrain"
 heavy_robot_industrial_equipment:0 "Industrial Robot"
 heavy_robot_industrial_equipment_desc:0 "Robots quickly found themselves becoming a crucial component within both the Equestrian and Zebrican industrial fields. Factories across both nations widely used a large variety of robotics for all sorts of purposes, leading to a slight employment crisis in the later half of the War."
 heavy_robot_industrial_equipment_short:0 "Industrial Robot"
 heavy_robot_sentinel_equipment:0 "Sentinel"
 heavy_robot_sentinel_equipment_desc:0 "The Sentinel was intended to be a heavy Equestrian robot capable of countering Zebrican tanks and breaking through Zebrican lines. Featuring heavy armor, a rapid-fire minigun (or an arcane laser in later models), and a built-in missile launcher, the Sentinel was capable of laying down heavy fire on the battlefield. They would also become fairly popular in domestic security, protecting many government buildings across Equestria."
 heavy_robot_sentinel_equipment_short:0 "Sentinel"
 heavy_robot_ultra_sentinel_equipment:0 "Ultra Sentinel"
 heavy_robot_ultra_sentinel_equipment_desc:0 "As the War entered the final few months, the Ministry of Awesome worked with the Ministry of Wartime Technology to create a super-weapon capable of laying waste to entire armies. The end result of this would be the Ultra-Sentinel: A truly immense robot that was as terrifying as it was flashy. It came equipped with a custom rainbow-gatling laser, capable of cutting through armor and flesh with equal ease, along with a built in missile ground-to-air defence system. Unfortunately for Equestria, the Jumla-Kifo would prove an effective counter to it not long after."
 heavy_robot_ultra_sentinel_equipment_short:0 "Ultra Sentinel"
 heavy_robot_jumla_kifo_equipment:0 "Jumla-Kifo Frontline Assault Bot"
 heavy_robot_jumla_kifo_equipment_desc:0 "The pinnacle of Zebra Robotics design, this late-war robot embodies the modern principles of Zebra warfare: Mobility, Survivability and Alphastrike. This 10’ tall Robot moves on 6 spider-like legs in rough terrain. Its Ceramo-steel chassis is covered in a thick paste of micro reflective agents. It is additionally outfitted with a Kanisa-class Shield Talisman, capable of displacing all ammunition up to 20mm. They are armed with a bank (4) of Ultralight lasers at their backs, either A Glowtusk Repeater or a Plasma-Flamethrower on the left arm, some AT weapon on the right arm, as well as an independent Umeme Turret and an active PD laser-bank."
