rustwreck.1.t:0 "Rustwreck seeks to renew trade-ties"
rustwreck.1.d:0 "Earlier today, our halls of power received a visitor, a low ranking sailor called Crows Nest from Rustwreck, proposing we build up a trade route between Valkyrie’s Point and The Bend. Now Rustwreck isn’t exactly an economic powerhouse, but they’ve still got a lot of stuff, and caps, that we’d like to get our hooves on. Of course, The Ringers aren’t going to be very happy to hear we’re trading outside of ‘The Family’, might even see it as undermining their power.\n\nWhat’s undeniable is that this deal will help both of us and would provide a big economic boost. We could use that boost to try and jumpstart our economy, either to become a better partner to The Ringers, or to strike out on our own. On the other hoof, The Ringers will be angry, and they’ve protected us. It’s like that saying, don’t bite the hoof that feeds you, never know when that offering might become a punch. Either way, we’ve got a choice to make."
rustwreck.1.a:0 "Accept the deal"
rustwreck.1.b:0 "Reject the deal"

rustwreck.2.t:0 "Light accepts the deal"
rustwreck.2.d:0 "REPORT: LIGHT TRADE AGREEMENT:\n\nMessenger CROWS NEST has arrived back from LIGHT from discussions on the creation of a trade route between VALKYRIE'S POINT and THE BEND. MAYOR DOUGHNUT has responded with an affirmative yes, meaning that construction of a trade route between VALKYRIE’S POINT and THE BEND can now begin, which will boost industry in both areas. Reports indicate THE RINGERS are unhappy with us for 'undermining' their 'family', a possible issue for later.\n\nThis is a good turn of events and exactly what we wanted to happen. This trade will be the start to massive economic growth. No major incidents reported, construction set to begin within the week."
rustwreck.2.a:0 "Cooperation wins again"

rustwreck.3.t:0 "Light rejects the deal"
rustwreck.3.d:0 "WIP\n\nMayor Doughnut has rejected our generous deal. It seems there will be no new trade-road between our lands and Lights. We will reinvest the caps allocated for the construction to try and encourage settlement in the territory."
rustwreck.3.a:0 "We will survive without them"

rustwreck.4.t:0 "The Scourge of the Sea"
rustwreck.4.d:0 "It’s a muggy and windy day in Rustwreck, as it always is. High Tides paced back and forth through his spacious office, glancing out the window every so often. A raider gang, pirates, more like, called the Razorsharks, have taken over an offshore mining rig, and much as he’d love to just shell them, that thing is just too valuable to damage or lose. Of course everypony has come up with their own ideas on how to solve this issue, from the more reasonable to the outright insane.\n\nWavebreaker put forward the most sane and normal proposal, requesting that our forces should simply engage the raiders at sea and on shore until we wear them down enough to force them to flee. Killing is what everyone else does to raiders, it’s what they deserve, it’s the most straight-forward path to victory. But of course, doing this would lose good sailors, ponies with families, jobs, dying against some monstrous scum of Equestria.\n\nDoctor Kelp, in all her doctorly confidence, has proposed a pacifistic solution. She’s treated some raiders we took captive before, talked to them, knows them, says they aren’t as scummy as we think, that if she could talk to them she could convince them to leave with some money. Not only does this require us to pay those freaks, but it puts our best Doctor at risk, and it just pushes the problem down the road. She seems confident, but overconfidence has killed many a so-called 'intellectual'.\n\nCrimson Waters rushed her proposal, written in red ink, well, hopefully that’s ink, never know with that psycho. Her proposal is to send her to a meeting and have her convince the raiders to join her cult. This would get rid of the raiders, and if it fails, Tartarus, it might get rid of her too, not the worst outcome. Worst outcome is she succeeds, then not only do we have more cultists, but cultists with experience. Whatever. A decision has to be made.."
rustwreck.4.a:0 "Let's wipe these Raiders"
rustwreck.4.b:0 "We shall spend caps, not blood"
rustwreck.4.c:0 "Let Crimson do her thing"

rustwreck.5.t:0 "Mission Accomplished"
rustwreck.5.d:0 "REPORT: OPERATION DULL RAZOR:\n\nRUSTWRECK’S navy and our loyal sailors and soldiers have ventured out to face the raider threat known as the RAZORSHARKS. Reports indicate VICTORY, as the RAZORSHARKS have been defeated with only minor losses to our side. The RAZORSHARKS have been hunted down and destroyed and are sure to never threaten our shores before. \n\nThe MINING RIG, ORICHALCHUM, has been taken over and scavenging teams have been hard at work scavenging through it and finding everything of value to RUSTWRECK and our glorious mission. Preliminary searches have reported valuable materials being found aboard ORICHALCUM, which is being inspected further by naval engineers. Further scavenging teams shall see what more hides. No major incidents reported, scavenging to continue."
rustwreck.5.a:0 "The Navy does not tolerate piracy!"

rustwreck.6.t:0 "Without a drop of blood shed"
rustwreck.6.d:0 "Reports have come in from Doctor Kelp, not done in the proper format expected of a report, but that’s what happens when a civilian like her writes. The raiders have left the Orichalcum, the name of the mining rig they inhabited, and not a single drop of blood was spilled. Of course, it cost us a pretty cap, but is money worth more than lives? Maybe. Especially since it looks like those pirate scum are heading north, to the Rain Riders’ territory, meaning we’ll have to keep a close eye on them.\n\nOf course Doctor Kelp has gotten praise from all around ever since she got back, ponies are happy their sons and husbands aren’t sailing out to fight pirates. Even those sceptical of her have kept their mouths shut, just watching the shores with slight worry. Of course she hasn’t let it get to her head, no, and that makes it all the worse, a quiet arrogance by not being arrogant about an achievement. If we end up seeing some of those pirates in a Rain Riders’ raid, gonna make sure that Kelp sees them, knows that her victory wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows."
rustwreck.6.a:0 "Violence isn't always the answer."

rustwreck.7.t:0 "Together against he Tides"
rustwreck.7.d:0 "Feasts, they’ve been the gathering place of ponies since the beginning of history, where enemies can sit and break bread with each other, sort out their differences in a quiet, sophisticated manner. Yet here we stand amongst brothers, sisters, followers and lackeys and those few golden who question yet follow anyway, and the feast is so… sloppy. Slobbering Raiders, shouting and drinking without a care in the world, so loud. Crimson stands and watches as her many cult members talk with the new converts, including Stranglevine, the raider leader who’s fully bought into it all. He’s a fool who’s not taken a single second to think, merely following the first pony who offered a hoof. A mutt, and that’s being unkind to dogs. They shout and talk of the wonders of all the cult has to offer, but they’re nothing but snakes in the grass, to turn so easily was a sign of weakness, not a sign of strength.\n\nShe would saunter out from the door she stood behind, and like that the feast would become quiet, as all look over at her. She flicks her mane to the side, clearing her eyes to look at each and every one of them, before putting on a practised grin and happy expression, ‘My brothers and my sisters, my lovely ponies from every trot of life, I am so happy you’ve accepted your new siblings in faith so readily. Stranglevine here was so attentive when I told him everything about the Endtide, following my every word like a do.. Ahem, a loyal hound eager to learn from its master, the perfect member!’ Her words are met with a cheer, as she scoops up a drink, hopping up onto the table, scattering around plates of food, holding it up with a wide smirk, ‘To our new brothers and sisters, converts to the truth, to the wondrous world they’ve opened their eyes to, to me, who shared with them the truth so freely, so readily! My followers, my beloved ponies, my friends and my family, raise a glass, raise a mug, raise your voice, all together we welcome them! Bound by blood, we are one!"
rustwreck.7.a:0 "Bound by blood, we are one!"

rustwreck.8.t:0 "Trade Fleet from Rustwreck"
rustwreck.8.d:0 "Earlier today a bunch of boats arrived from Rustwreck, laden with goods and ready to trade with us. Of course we’ve always been open to trade with them, they have a lot of stuff to give, but we’ve treated them no different than any other trader. This fleet though came with some documents, an agreement to offer us, saying we should lower our tariffs of them and be more open to their economies.\n\nNow there’s some benefits and drawbacks to both options. Saying yes will give us some better trade, a better economy, but then again, it might also open them up to getting better too. We don’t know if Rustwreck is going to be on our side forever, so giving them some economic opportunity might come back to bite our flanks in the future. Of course, if we say no, we’ll also lose out on that benefit. We have a lot to gain and a lot to potentially lose, we’ll have to think."

The Celestial Sea Fleet, rebuilt with the latest technology available after the disaster that happened in 1014, was dispatched on an interception mission to catch the stripes before they had a chance to get close to Equestria and her sacred shoreline. Passing by Albion, the Fleet was assisted by Northern Air Command, carrying dozens of Raptors, Skytanks, and a Thunderhead, who moved to assist the Fleet and her flagship, the Battleship HMS Sunrise.\n\nContact with the enemy was established near the Stepstone Sea, seeing the enemy fleet consisted of many smaller vessels, and a few larger ones such as the enemy flagship, the Gloriana. High Tides would act decisively upon spotting the enemy fleet, seeing the three options before him. He could hunt down the enemy’s flagship and destroy their spirits, as well as their command structure, he could destroy as many smaller vessels as possible to remove all extra firepower, or he could attack carefully as to conserve strength for future conflicts. Of all options, High Tides decided upon:"

rustwreck.11.d:0 "The Celestial Sea Fleet failed their mission...\n\nWe failed Equestria...\n\nWhere Equestrian lasers boiled the sea and melted hulls, the Zebras responded with salvoes of hundreds of missiles that minced flesh and steel in equal measure.\nWhere tactical Megaspells ripped holes in the Zebrican formation, they were answered by balefire torpedoes that vaporized Equestrian ships without even wreckage left behind.\nThe battle was even... we could have won.\nCould have won if Northern Air Command hadn't betrayed us. By some subtle signal our air support broke of the battle as one and ascended beyond the clouds. Radio transmissions urged every Pegasus in the fleet to retreat to the clouds as well, but the Admiral ordered that our own anti-aircraft guns be used to shoot every desserter out of the sky. Few dared to try and join their feathered brothers after that. Still, without air support the battle would be a one sided slaughter. The order to retreat was given and luckily the Imperial fleet was damaged enough to not pursue.\nJust as preparations had been made to rendevouz at Albion and repair, our systems went out of control. Warning sirens went off on every ship in the fleet, striking many an unlucky sailor deaf for days after.\n\nIt had finally happened!\nThe much dreaded megaspell exchange...the end of the world.\nMinutes later, the sirens manually disabled, sickly green explosions could be seen on the mainland as zebrican Balefire Warheads destroyed everything we once held dear. An hour off the coast High Tides watched several warheads impact around Albion, shrouding the whole metropolis in necromantic fallout. Where to now? Prance? Manehattan? Fillydelphia? No, every major city and known military installation would be targeted.\nWith his homeland dying mere miles away, Admiral High Tides charted a course for the little used harbour of Redheap on the Poninsula.\nThe world was over, but on their way south, they would save what they could..."

Sailors have renamed it to Rustwreck out of some sort of humor about the ships crashed into shore, attempting to make light of the situation. While annoying on its own, what annoyed High Tides more than anything was when one of these jokesters tried to seriously convinced him to get rid of more of the fleet, due to ‘economic drain’ and ‘resource use’, nothing but excuses from Zebra-loving pansies who want to see the last shining light of Equestria snuffed out.\n\nSure, its been ten years since Equestria died, and High Tides looks more like a zombie than a pony at this point, but that navy is still more valuable than the opinion of a hooffull of sailors. But they have a point, the fleet won’t need to turn its guns against the striped menace for a while longer, and if Her Majesty’s Navy wants a chance to ever spill striped blood again, it’ll cost a sacrifice. So, biting his tongue and putting down his pride, High Tides would reluctantly agree to a proposition on what to do with the ships."

rustwreck.13.d:0 "HMS Iron Shield, once a great enforcer of Equestrian power, Luna’s long-reaching hoof, even if just a cruiser, has now become a derelict hive of scum and psychopathic freaks, otherwise known as the Cult of the Endtide. High Tides would be given a tour after a surprisingly cordial meeting with the Cult, though his bodyguards retain a quiet vigilance, you never know with cultists, after all. He made a show of correcting the cultist giving the tour at every point, after all, he knows damn well what a cruiser’s inside looks like and he doesn’t need some freak to explain it to him like he’s never seen it before. Each correction would make his guards tense slightly and prepare for lashback, but none would ever come, the cultist laughing it off and continuing the tour. Being laughed at only put High Tides in an even worse mood, and he had to suppress many, many violent feelings before the tour ended.\n\nNow stood in a meeting room, once a captain’s quarters, he met Crimson Waters, head freak, dressed in a disgusting robe with brown stains all over it, probably blood considering it’s this psycho. Her stance is terrible too, like one of those pansy Army generals who got in through birth, confident and theatrical, the type of pony he’d like to give a lashing if they ever got on his ship. Crimson surprised him, though, because as soon as everypony else left, she would begin to speak more normally, giving him an offer to end all the recent trouble.\n\nShe gave him a list, a list of names, fake troublemakers who Crimson wants to take the blame so she can deal with the actual perpetrators more subtly. Given she’s the leader of the freaks who caused the trouble to begin with, this offer first came off as extremely rude, arrogant even, and it took until Tides was shouting and growling at her that she fully explained. Do this for her, trust her, let her take care of it, and the cult will align with the state, calming tensions. Just take the list and blame them, let her do the work, and calm everything down.\n\nHigh Tides’ voice sounded more raspy than normal as he talked over the deal, a pounding in the back of his head telling him to just kill her for even thinking she can offer him this poisoned deal. But her cult is big, it could be helpful to have on his side, even if the freaks are psychos. Of course, she’s also giving him a list of ponies she doesn’t like, or is even scared of, it’d be easy to just go to them, make them work against her. As she flashed him a final, confident smirk, he’d be left to make the choice in a second of thought."

Those cult freaks, the Endtide, have been fighting hoof and tooth in Westshore and in the Poninsula, giving those freaks the exact fate they deserve, bullets to the skull so their psycho-babble doesn’t make any other freak follow them. These insane freaks, unlike those Zebras freaks, were easy to beat, scattered and disorganised, wiped up easier than a dead roach by a broom and pan. Those freaks didn’t even suspect we were coming, they hardly had weapons, made them easier to shoot than a pacifistic protest back in the good old days.\n\nSadly these freaks have been entrenched in a few places, strongholds with guns, ammo, and plenty of psychopathic freaks to use them. It will cost good ponies their lives, it will cost us bullets, but we’ll get it done. These freaks aren’t worth the bullets used to kill them, but as long as they try and destabilise us, they’re a threat worth killing. Soon there are going to be some proper assaults on those freaks, and once we’re done, well, Crimson Waters is gonna be surrounded by a bunch of ponies losing their crimson."

Doctor Kelp and her ‘Council’ gave us some caps and the infrastructure to rebuild it all, though that pacifistic high-on-her-pony Kelp is going to rub it in our nose for the rest of time by never actually acknowledging it. Not like that Manehattenite pacifist could ever handle actually going out there to fight, nah, she’d turn to the bottle like the rest of her kind always do when the going gets tough.\n\nEven though they’re both pansies, they’re helping, so they’ve had some say in stuff, like renaming the town. Wavebreaker actually gave a good idea when he got his face out of one of them geek novels, said we should name the town after a pony who was in the first wave, a hero who died fighting. Probably because the geek feels guilty about not being there. Kelp wants to restore the old name of the town, which isn’t bad either, it’s about time some normal names came back to Equestria, enough of this ‘Rain Riders’ and ‘Liberation Army’ and whatever in Tartarus’s name those traitors are naming their fiftieth cloud city or bunker.

Before they could say a word, she would speak, quickly and without that trademark cult personality, ‘You don’t want to kill me! Celestia’s name, do you actually think I believed all that cult stuff? I’m the one who made it up, me, made it up out of thin air, I’m not a believer, I’m just a mare who wanted power, okay, just a normal mare who’s plan got out of hoof! I went too far, okay, I know, I shouldn’t have gone against you, but look at all I’ve done, look at everything-‘\n\nShe’s cut off by a rising growl from High Tides, who presses against the cage door separating them, speaking in a very raspy voice, ‘I should throw you overboard until you wither and die like the insect psychopathic freak you are!’ Wavebreaker would nod along, looking at her, ‘Sir, with all due respect, I agree, she’s done a lot wrong. A pony with the power to speak like her is a threat, sir, one which shouldn’t be underestimated. She is like a Sirin, sir, it’s best we not give her time to sing.’ High Tides looks over at him, deadpan, ‘Is that a reference to one of your geek stories?’ Wavebreaker blinks and shakes his head too quickly, ‘No! No sir! I don’t even know what you’re talking about, sir, geek stories have nothing to do with what I do in my free time, sir, nor what I do on shore leave, sir, and respectfully, sir, there is no connection between me and it, sir, it is more disconnected than a flamethrower and a 155mm gun, sir.’\n\nDoctor Kelp steps forward, ‘If I may, Wavebreaker, that is quite enough of your obscuration. High Tides, I believe that Crimson Waters should be given amnesty rather than defenestrated, I believe it is pertinent to consider the possibility of beneficial consequences of keeping her around.’ High Tides opens his mouth to speak, but Kelp talks before he can, ‘Like her or call her a psychopath, though narcissistic personality disorder would be more accurate if we’re psychologically diagnosing her, you must acquiesce and admit she has done something impressive. She built a rival power system within your nation-state, one whose prominence threatened your reign, one which could have easily overthrown you given time. That power is not to be thrown away, it would be like a unicorn throwing away telekinesis, rather that dangerous power should be used, abused, to your advantage.’ High Tides would frown, but relent."

Cults, though, are infuriating, claiming they have the answers to every problem, just throwing gasoline onto the problems that already exist. Before the war it was Nightmare Cultists, bats and freaks who wanted that psycho, Nightmare Moon, to return, during the war it was those zebra kooks who didn't know flank from tail, shouting their babble about stars. Nowadays , it’s the Cult of the Endtide, freaks that are just as bad as those before then, but now they serve a purpose due to that uneasy alliance.\n\nTheir preachers have been getting more bold recently, preaching their nonsense right outside of the capital, and some ponies were even buying into their psycho cult preachings. If we let them continue like this then more ponies are going to become freaks like them, kooks spouting about doomsday and apocalypse like we haven’t already gone through one, but it’ll keep them happy and on our side. Of course, we could also crack down, throw these freaks into a cell, spare our ponies from their nonsense, but that would make Crimson mad.

But the world has changed recently, a silver-tongued psychopath has taken Fillydelphia, Ranger-freaks are coming out of their bunkers, those freaky alicorns are making moves, not to mention the radio doesn’t shut up about heroes this and heroes that, it’s obvious that things are coming to a boiling point.\n\nHigh Tides stands in his office, overlooking the capital, feeling a lowly simmering pride deep in his chest, seeing how far this place has come. Ponies trot safely, no raider freaks are around, no pinko pacifists haunt the streets, it’s like a slice of the old world if everything was more decayed. But it can come so much further, with slow, stable growth in the civilian sector it could be so much more, a maretropolis, a shining star on the coast, a screw you to those zebras for thinking they could destroy it. But there’s tensions, there’s gonna be war soon, and even the best discipline doesn’t beat a foe if they don’t have ammo to shoot with. Thus he stands, looking out, pondering, is it best to focus on defence and war, so they’ll never be caught off guard, or focus on building up the civilian sector and making everything better?"

We don’t know what has infected you, and if this pathogen has a high infection risk then it could cause havoc amongst us all.’ He looks at her and opens his mouth to speak, but in a surprising show of force, she stomps her hoof, “Tides. You will listen to your doctor and you will listen now. I am stumped by what’s causing you to be sick and I need time to research it, to find out what this could be, ghouls don’t usually catch pathogens, so this is unique. There’s no room for further questioning, you will listen and obey, and you will remain in your bed.’ She looks deep into his eyes, before spinning around, trotting out of there.\n\nWavebreaker enters as soon as she leaves, giving Tides a salute and a slightly worried look. Tides looks at him and closes his eyes, ‘Wavebreaker. I hope you didn’t have any plans for that geek stuff for the next week, I need you to take over. Damned pinko Doctor ordered me to remain in my bed and I know better than to piss off your medical staff. You’ll be taking care of things for me, understood.’ Wavebreaker nods, ‘Yes sir, though I should note I did not plan to do anything that involved geekiness for the next week, or the next rest of my life, sir.

Your external self looks fine, as fine as a ghoul can look, but inside, Admiral, your body has been withering.’ She lifts up a flask to her lips, taking a deep sip of warming whiskey, before putting it down, speaking slowly, ‘It’s reached your brain now, Admiral, that’s the cause of the migraines you feel, it’s your brain slowly rotting.

He’s only a Ensign at this point, but he’ll be damned before he gives the stripes a win without some blood.\n\nTides speaks, his voice a bit more raspy than he remembers, ‘Hey there, Doc.

Oh Celestia, I’m really dying, it hurts so much.’\n\nKelp looks away from the bed, taking out a flask and taking a deep swig from it, before looking back, ‘Tides. I. I have made a cure for the process, one which can halt it. But. It’s not pleasant. It’ll be the worst pain you’ve ever felt, assuming it even works. You’ll hopefully remember everything and be able to increase your lifespan again. But I can’t promise anything.

High Tides was a grumpy stallion, hardly nice, but he was a good stallion, a stallion who deserved so much more. Another swig. She should have seen the signs, should have prepared a cure before, maybe he’d still be awake. Another swig, but nothing comes, the flask run dry. His body is there in the room, catatonic.\n\nThe nurses and her had injected him with the cure before retreating, watching with baited breath as he spasmed, screamed, and begged for the pain to be over. His mother, Celestia, Luna, even Discord, he begged them all, before it all went silent. She approached him with bated breath and hope, reaching out for a response, but none came. The others checked him, a burst blood vessel during the struggle, he’s still alive, but never to awake again. It wouldn’t even occur to her. She’d sit next to him, holding his rotting hoof, hoping they’re wrong, hoping he’d awake. He never did. No matter how much she begged he would, no matter how much she prayed, he never woke up.\n\nShe’s drunk off of her whiskey, but it doesn’t help. Every time she closes her eyes she sees him make the decision, looking so hopeful and so afraid. She trots over to him and takes his hoof, holding it for a minute, before she whispers to him, ‘I’m sorry, Tides. I tried my best.

Who’s to say you ain’t just gonna call everything an emergency, eh, who’s to say you ain’t gonna be a dictator?’ He grins slightly, ‘Why should my crew not just leave right now?’\n\nShe looks at him, sitting down and picking up her whiskey, taking a deep sip, before setting it down, ‘Jacques Perrylous, I require your presence because I trust you to do what needs to be done. I’m a Doctor, I swore to do no harm when I took my oath, believe me, the ivory towers of power are not my place. But Wavebreaker is hawkish, Crimson is insane, and you don’t have enough support to win leadership, I am the only mare educated enough to take the reins. I also need your help and experience, Jacques. You’ve been sailing a sinking ship for twenty years.’ She picks up her whiskey, and downs the last of it, then sliding her papers to the centre of the table, the paper being a proposal for emergency powers, ‘Welcome to my sinking ship."

Above it all, in the Harbourmaster’s Office, stand Kelp and Wavebreaker, drinking whiskey and coffee respectively. Bags line the bottom of their eyes, both having only gotten sleep in winks and blinks the past few days. Paper lays on the table between them, terms of agreement between the two sides.\n\nWavebreaker paces back and fourth, looking out the window to the stand-off below, while speaking in a high-strung voice, ‘Why did this have to happen? It was all going so well, Tides seemed to be doing better, to just die like he did, it’s not right. It’s not right at all.’ He looks at Kelp with narrowed eyes, ‘And his killer is the one telling me I should just give up and let her lead? Your failure caused him to die, Kelp, and even worse it caused him to die in pain, in suffering, horribly. It’s not just murder you did, it’s torture, and now I’m expected to sign the country to you? You know I could send the marines in, they would likely win.’\n\nDoctor Kelp sighs softly and picks up her whiskey glass, downing another portion of it, before putting it down, ‘It was supposed to cure him, not kill him, and he is still alive, even if catatonic. I won’t make excuses for my failures, my mistakes have been numerous and often, that is not the problem at hoof.’ She taps the paper in front of her, ‘Wavebreaker, you’ll be the new Admiral, even if the country won’t belong to you. You will command the navy and be at its helm, you’ll be able to keep me in check, checks and balances, Wavebreaker. You could order your soldiers forward and you might win, but you would leave us weak and crippled, paving the way for the Ringers to conquer us. I know you aren’t happy about it. I’m not happy about it either, if I could give away this responsibility, I would. But Rustwreck comes first.’ Wavebreaker picks up his own coffee, downing it as he closes his eyes. Slowly, he opens them back up, and signs his name on the paper."

While averting civil war from the New Admiralty, Crimson Waters and the Cult of the Endtide have seized many outlying settlements for their cause, ensuring any conflict would be a bloodbath. Thus, I have invited to the Council today the mare herself, Crimson Waters.’ Doctor Kelp would finish her droll speech as the doors swing open, Crimson Waters sauntering into the room, a group of bodyguards following right behind her. Her each step is purposeful and confident, her eyes scanning every set at the table. Doctor Kelp continues her speech, ‘In order to find alliance and compromise with the Cult of Endtimes, we will be voting on a bill to give them representation, should Crimson agree.’\n\nCrimson flicks her mane through the air and grins as Kelp finishes speaking, ‘My oh my, are you all sure you haven’t picked a robot as your leader? Such lifeless prose, and such a stiff pose, I’ve heard more life from Spite-Bots.’ She chuckles, her cultists chuckling along, as she begins to trot around the table, behind the backs of the council members, ‘But even a broken bot is right twice a day, oh yes indeed, she is right to not want to fight me. None of you have seen a second of war nor a drop of blood, you’re virgins to destruction, afraid to ever face the flames stoked outside. You’re going to be angry when I have my seat alongside you, you’ll think I’m a freak, like the late corpse.’ She leans her head in to the table, placing it right on the shoulder of the sitting Jacques, who looks over at her as she grins, ‘I think I want my seat right beside this one, oh yes, that’ll be nice. I accept your terms, Kelp, after all, bound by blood, we are one.’\n\nThe council would all be uncomfortable in the minutes following, but, with a resounding yes vote, the bill would pass, granting the Cult of the Endtide many privileges."

Other times he wants nothing more than to rip out some stripes’ throat. It’s too much. He’s dying, that’s clear to see, he can’t even summon the energy to care about that anymore. But Rustwreck needs a leader, no matter if they’re a geek, or a freak. Just. Someone. Someone after him.\n\nWavebreaker stands above High Tides in his bed, and though the stallion tries to look stoic and professional, he can’t stop his eyes from looking worried, scared, and sad. The two would talk for hours, from the early morning to the mid afternoon, after all, Tides can’t do anything else. Wavebreaker is a good stallion, he hates the cowardly Pegasi and the cowardly MWT just as much as Tides, he won’t let them trot all over Rustwreck, no, he’ll use the navy to blast them out of the sky and bunker. He sees Wastelanders as tools, assets to be given orders and told what to do, he’s pragmatic, practical, he’ll lead them well. Better than that, he’s practically lived his whole life on a boat, he’ll be able to order the military like nobody else, making Rustwreck worth respecting. He’s a nerd, and a geek, and his glasses are stupid, but that doesn’t matter. Not now. Now anymore. Wavebreaker would leave after a long time, his eyes sad as he said his final goodbyes.\n\nCrimson would spend the rest of the day talking to Tides, the mare’s every word being confident, even if they’re mostly insane. Her eyes shine with intelligence and charisma as she speaks, and with some care for Tides, even if they don’t see eye to eye on everything. She’s insane, of course, a psychopathic freak leading a cult who’s even worse, blood drinkers and killers. But she’s the leader of a cult so disliked, yet somehow it’s gained so much popularity. The cult is also treated well by her, and no matter what one can say, she will listen when someone speaks. Above all, she’s charismatic, and maybe that’s what Rustwreck needs, someone who can lead them, unify them. She would leave as the night begins, using her last words with Tides to wish him good luck on the other side.\n\nBoth candidates have their upsides and downsides. With his mind slowly slipping, Tides calls his staff into the room, before declaring his official successor."

Being hailed on the radio, they confirmed they were the Stableside, the very same barge that was thought to have been gone. They were allowed closer, and upon seeing them, it was discovered that they weren’t lying. Some of the old sailors matched descriptions for the same crew we sent twenty years ago, matched them exactly.\n\nAs our ships neared, we were able to identify the captain, who spoke to us over radio, a Griffon who claims to be the adopted son of the Commodore we sent out. His name is Jacques Perrylous, a Griffon blue in color, with an eye patch over one eye and a wooden peg replacing one of his legs. Most of the crew was in some bad state, he was no different, dirty and looking slimmer than average, it seems like they’ve gone through Tartarus to get back home. Our ships have begun to escort them back to the shore, with many curious of the tale these travellers have to tell, and excited for the experience they can bring."

The days after, however, tensions began to rise again in every town and city, arguments and little fights becoming all the more common, everyone knows the time is approaching where Rustwreck’s fate will be decided.\n\nWhispered in the alleyways and spoke in hushed tones in safe-houses and barracks, the vultures, Crimson Waters and Wavebreaker, preparing for when the time comes. The Cult of the Endtide and the New Admiralty gather their supporters and prepare them, taking up arms, drawing out plans, using every last favor they have across the nation.

Despite herself, her hooves tap nervously against the ground as she paces back and forward in a private room, her mind playing fifty different ways everything could go wrong, and a hundred more for it to go well.\n\nThe door opens, she looks hopefully as a cultist gives her a nod, slowly breaking out into a wide smile as the cultist gives the news. Wavebreaker was caught completely off guard, his soldiers and troops surrounded before they even woke up, and the stallion himself placed under house arrest. The only conflict was during the taking of the old admiralty building, where five guards and two cultists lost their lives in the fighting. Nobody stands against her now, the Cult has won.\n\nAs the messenger leaves, the anxiety comes back, chased by a wave of relief. Crimson has won, but these upcoming days will be where victory is truly secured, where she will show the nation every plan she has. Of course, ponies will be expecting a speech, the blind sheep of Rustwreck seeking a charismatic voice through these times, not caring what is said, but how.

Nobody would know that the Old Admiralty is out of their positions, fewer would care, but all will know when he begins to improve the nation for all of them. No longer is the Admiralty split between old and new, from today onwards, Rustwreck’s Admiralty stand unified.\n\nThe passing of Admiral High Tides, rest his soul, was an unfortunate day for everyone, and will be forever remembered as a day of mourning. But eventually, after a few years, a bit of joy will come after that, as ponies celebrate the opportunity that his passing has given them.

Crimson looks over at Kelp, setting aside that list and flipping through another folder of officers, ‘You know, Kelp, Loyalty was always my favorite Element of Harmony. I enjoy those who are loyal, like you, you’re loyal to your principles above all else, just like I am as well. In fact, the whole ‘bound by blood, we are one’, that’s just loyalty in a phrase, one in purpose, in following, so on. So I’m sure you understand why these ponies have to go, they aren’t loyal, they’re, how to say, disharmonious, chaotic. And like with the Nightmare and Discord, what is disharmonious is dangerous, and is gotten rid of.’\n\nKelp snorts softly and drinks down another glass of whiskey, setting it down too hard as she looks over at Crimson, ‘Don’t try to justify this purge to me, Crimson. You have your names, your list, leave me out of the rest of it. I’m a Doctor. I do no harm. Just, just get on with it, and leave me alone.’\n\nCrimson grins softly, opting for no response, instead turning back to the new files she has. Officers and Admirals, of course they can’t be taken care of right now, they have enough guns to flatten the whole country. But eventually, some will need to be gotten rid of. So, listening to the sounds of drinking and depression coming from Kelp, Crimson would mark them all, live, die, or dismissed."

Luckily there was little damage from the bombardment due to the late hour, but this was still extremely bad.

The only other one in the room being Downhaul, the stallion wanting to see what all the fuss is about.\n\nWavebreaker shakes his head as Crimson pushes over an oversized plastic mech, ‘You rolled three sixes but the Flash Magnus Mark Three Anti Infantry Mechanised Pony has twenty hit points, therefore it still survives with two left and does not die. Therefore you do not win in this exchange, and I still have my Flash Magnus Mark Three Anti Infantry Mechanised Pony.’ Crimson shakes her head back, as the two then look to Kelp for answers.

This would help make Rustwreck proper into an unbreakable fortress of steel, an industrial centre second, or perhaps even greater than, Fillydephia itself. Proposals range from mass large-scale redistribution from the new lands to more small-scale.\n\nThe only opposition comes from Doctor Kelp and some of her economists. They argue against Crimson Waters, holy be her name, that this redistribution is near equal to a cultural genocide of the newly conquered areas. The only appealing argument from their side was to point out that this centralization of industry and population makes the nation more vulnerable to attack. Should an enemy somehow take the capital, it would remove the majority of industry and population. They argue that keeping ponies and industry spread out would ensure that we can continue to fight on even should the capital fall.

One can’t give one hundred and twenty two caps to exchange, no, one can only give over two hundred plus thirty, as the system works in intervals of ten. It takes another few minutes of arguing before the merchant grumbles and pays the caps, being given the scrip.\n\nTrudging back to the official, the merchant would place down the scrip they have, getting all the blood bags possible. However, once all is said and done, they’d be left with eight extra scrip, the merchant looking at it, ‘What am I supposed to do with this?

Apparently ponies really like to put caps into functioning places instead of non-functioning, so spending these caps could result in foreign ponies investing back into us and our industry.\n\nAnother advisor stumbled across some random blue unicorn stallion who’s selling some schematics and blueprints he apparently stole from somewhere in Manehatten.

They press a button on the handle, making the plastic light up a bright green color. The follower looks over, confused, as hoof steps come down the hallway. Wavebreaker trotting down the halls, exploring it himself. He looks at the plastic glowing thing, his eyes widening as he speaks, ‘Is that a Glow-Cutlass from Moon Fights?’ He quickly trots over, picking up another one, which begins to glow blue. He smiles widely, picking up another which glows red, throwing it over to Crimson, ‘We’re fighting with these.’\n\nCrimson catches the red cutlass, looking at it, then shrugging and smiling slightly, ‘This should be fun.’ She charges at Wavebreaker, as the two begin a play fight, except it’s actually way more serious than it should be. She swings with force and speed while he backs up, feinting and dodging, even doing a sick combat roll behind her at one point. He lifts up his saber and brings it down on her leg, smirking as he does, ‘And thus fallest the evil Empress, Crimson Waters, and the galaxy is safe.’ Crimson rolls her eyes and grins, ‘You’re a nerd. To think that ponies used to have the time to waste building this type of stuff."

rustwreck.51.t:0 "Breaking the Gates of the Damned"
rustwreck.51.d:0 "Thestrals have never been liked in Equestria, especially not in the slave pits of Fillydelphia. When ponies get desperate, they turn against each other, and pick on the weakest among them, the hated, those to blame. New Moon knew this since birth, she knew this when she was dragged to Fillydelphia, she knew this when she slipped away going between jobs. She’s survived for months now skirting through alleyways stealing what she can, sticking to the shadows, staying out of sight of the slavers. Something happened though, a war, so the whispers say, and a few days ago ponies entered the city. Covered in blood, fighting street to street to take the city, probably just a bunch of psychopathic raiders who would kill her should they find her. But food has gotten scarce now, things are harder now.\n\nNew Moon got clumsy today. She went out during the day to one of those preachers who accompanied the soldiers, and tried to steal something as they passed by, but they noticed. Now, she runs through alleyways, ducking around corners and keeping to the shadows as the preacher chases her down, surely set on killing her, or worse. Eventually she’d come to a halt as she came to a dead end, brick wall in front of her, too tired to even think of flying away. Panting, she slowly turns, as the preacher rounds the corner of the alleyway, looking at her. He breathes heavily, ‘You’re a quick runner.’ He takes a second to catch his breath, before reaching into his robes, slowly taking out a piece of bread. He sets it down, smiling softly, ‘Here, you look hungry. The Endtide is here to help ponies like you. But I know you’re afraid.’ He steps back, giving her a softer smile, ‘If you want more, I’ll be by the exit of this alleyway tomorrow. Perhaps we could talk.’ He turns and leaves, leaving New Moon panting. She slowly steps forward and picks up the bread, looking it over for a moment, before looking after the preacher. If he’s giving out bread, he can’t be too bad, right?"

rustwreck.52.t:0 "Checkmate"
rustwreck.52.d:0 "May the best pony win, I think that was a common saying before the bombs.’ Crimson Waters stands on the roof of the Alpha-Omega Hotel in Fillydelphia, looking around the city, where preachers move from street to street, offering food, water, aid, and faith to the slaves of the city. Prisoners of war would be marched through the streets to prison camps, slavers and raiders from Red Eye, a deactivated Steel Ranger trapped within their own armor after it was hit by a spark grenade, being pulled along in a wagon. A few Mobsters, still causing issues now, even one or two Stable ponies who picked up arms against her. Slaves stand on the side of the road, watching as the enemies are pulled by, not shouting in anger, but merely watching the procession.\n\nA special cart would exit from the inside of the hotel, carrying precious cargo within it. Crimson watches from up high as the cart nears the gates into Fillydelphia, the ‘Gates of the Damned’, which are now wide open for anyone to come and go. Slaves watch just as she does as the cart is slowly opened, and a body is taken from within. Though partly burned, Red Eye’s body is still easily identifiable, especially with his Stable-cloak, which he’s been permitted to keep even after death. No cheer comes as they hang his body from the gates, the slaves are too tired for that. But they do smile. Crimson smiles as well."
rustwreck.52.a:0 "We have much to do"

rustwreck.53.t:0 "Those who can be saved"
rustwreck.53.d:0 "Not everyone we fought against is bad, nor are they deserving of death.’ In the middle of a meeting room sits three individuals, Crimson Waters, Doctor Kelp, and, in front of them both, the slightly battered Protege, protege of Red Eye. Crimson continues, with a small smile, ‘If every pony I fought was bad, Kelp, then you wouldn’t be standing here. Nor would Wavebreaker, wherever he is. Red Eye was bad, yes, but from what the slaves have said, this one is quite nice. For a slaver, some even say he was once a slave himself.’ She looks to Protege, ‘What of you? Are you willing to help?’\n\nProtege looks on as Kelp pours herself a drink and takes a sip of it. She looks at him, sliding him the glass, but he slides it back after a second, without drinking from it, ‘Red Eye was the greatest hope this Wasteland has ever seen, and you killed him. You killed him and put him on display for all to see. You, your cultists, they talk a big game about the betterment of the Wasteland, but I don’t see it. Red Eye did bad, yes, but he built factories, he restored houses, he’s done more than you ever will. Because he was a good pony, a pony of pure-heart who did what was necessary. But you? You’re raiders who smile when you kill somepony.’\n\nCrimson looks on at him, before giving him a wide smile, ‘That’s the correct answer. You see, I admire Red Eye in many ways, you’re right, he’s done much more than anyone else in the Wasteland. But he was tied down by his methods, by the brutality of those who followed him. He’s built a foundation, me, I’m going to add scaffolding, I’m going to add the walls, the floors, heat, electric, but I need help to do that. Call me a raider if you want, but this raider wants you to keep her reigned in.’ She then slides him a piece of paper, ‘You have two options. Say no, go back to the camp you came from, where you will waste away and do nothing. Or make me a list, a list of those who are too far gone, those who deserve to be killed for all to watch. Do that, and I’ll gladly have you by my side. Your choice."

rustwreck.54.d:0 "Crimson stands in a room of her closest advisors, some she might even call friends, in Stabletec HQ. Their best scribe sat with a large sheet of paper, writing down what will be the basis of the country going forward, a constitution. Most of it was just defining what was already known to be true across the realm, but one part of it was most important. Crimson would speak to the gathered advisors, and to all those listening by radio, ‘I shouldn’t have to spend too long going over the horrors of slavery, my friends, we’ve seen it first-hoof in Fillydelphia. The idea that one pony can own another is silly, ridiculous, and even worse, it’s inefficient. It is a core tenant of our religion that slavery should not exist, and with this, we will declare it to be over. Every citizen of our faith, in accordance with it, will be freed from the bonds of slavery forevermore.’\n\nWavebreaker looks over from his seat, frowning softly, ‘Of your faith? This is not something which should be restricted to only those who convert, Crimson.’ Crimson looks over at him, smiling widely, ‘Conversion is not necessary, Wavebreaker, nor is belief and faith. By living within my borders, you are a member of the Endtide, because you are under my protection. You may worship Celestia, Luna, some Zebra god, even Nightmare Moon, or nobody at all, and still you will be under my protection. The Endtide is all of us, it is you, it is me, it is everyone listening on the radio.’ She takes a second to take a breath, before grinning softly, ‘And with this decree, I do declare, the Endtide has ended slavery.’"

rustwreck.55.d:0 "So this is Rustwreck, is it?’ Two ponies trot down the streets in the now city of Rustwreck, by vendors selling food, water, and even one selling flowers, what little exist. One of the two ponies is a mare, Jasmine, carrying a small flower in the collar of a non-combat military uniform. She smiles over to her companion, a short, small stallion who was once a slave in Fillydelphia, smiling more as she speaks, ‘It is. It used to be a lot smaller under the late Admiral. This is what I fought to protect, Pick, all of these ponies.’ He smiles softly, ‘Aww, and here I thought you were conscripted just so you could come free me. I’m hurt, scarred, mortified by your words, woe is me.’ The two laugh a bit as they trot together, until they reach a small house on the outskirts of the city.\n\nJasmine slowly trots up and knocks on the door. A minute passes before it opens, a mare on the other side, around her age, looking at Jasmine like she’s seeing a ghost. Jasmine smiles softly, ‘Tea, I’m back.’ The two mares quickly hug, while Jasmine continues to speak, ‘We’re, umm, going to a volunteer army. So I’m back. For good.’ Tea pulls away from the hug, sniffing a bit, ‘Jasmine, I, I thought you were dead! Two years you’ve been away, no letter, no nothing back!’ She pouts and pushes Jasmine playfully with her hoof, ‘Off to go play soldier-filly.’ Jasmine laughs a bit in response, before leaning in and nuzzling Tea, ‘I’m back, Tea, and I think I’m ready to move on to playing wife for a little bit.’ She smiles, ‘Oh, by the way, this is Pick.’ She motions to her friend, who gives a small wave, ‘I saved him from Fillydelphia and he’s been following me like a lost puppy since then. Can we keep him?’ Jasmine would snicker a bit, followed by Pick, then Tea, as the three begin to fully laugh, the two lovers embracing once more as Pick watches with a soft smile."

rustwreck.56.t:0 "The Light at the end of the tunnel"
rustwreck.56.d:0 "Radios flick on all across the country, former slaves, soldiers, Stable ponies, cultists, and once raiders would gather around together, sharing food, drinks, and entire blocks gather around the radio. The radio crackles to life, as the voice of Crimson comes from it, speaking softly, ‘Greetings, ponies of the Endtide, ponies of surrounding countries, griffons, diamond dogs, whoever else might be listening. You have all been very faithful in me these past few trying years, and I am grateful for that like you could never imagine. Many of us have died, many of us have been freed, but through it all, our faith has kept us alive, it’s kept us going. But faith isn’t all a country needs, no, a country needs leadership, and I’m afraid to say I’m not immortal. I am no alicorn, not a ghoul, nor any sort of dark magician, I’m a pony, and sometime, I’m going to die.’\n\nAll chatter dies down as everyone listens in, ears perked, ‘I’m going to try something that hasn’t been tried in Equestria before. Then again, that’s nothing new, is it? Nobody in Equestria before has led a cult, a faith, to such wonderful heights, nobody has ever had such a positive effect on those under them. I will be creating a republic, elected by you, the ponies of the nation. I know this will come as a shock to many of you, and many need time to get used to it. In order to ensure stability, I will remain the head of the government for another decade, while we set up an independent parliament and court system. If all goes well, I’ll be able to retire, finally. I happily await your parliamentary runs for election.’ The radio then flicks off.\n\nAll across the nation, ponies would celebrate, or they’d be anxious over the sudden change. Already plans would be drafted and money would be gathered for those hoping to make history as the first elected leaders of their district. Meanwhile, back in her personal office, Crimson swirls a glass of Kelp’s whiskey, taking a sip of it and smirking to herself, ‘I told you all this bloodcult was just a facade. Behold my doubters and despair, not only have I made a better Equestria, but now I can retire.’"
rustwreck.56.a:0 "They never saw it coming."

rustwreck.57.t:0 "War never changes. . . but ponies do!"
rustwreck.57.d:0 "Republic Day, the celebration held on the day that the republic was founded, not the most creative name, and some international observers get it mixed up with The Republic’s Day from The Republic’s founding, but it works. Down in the streets, ponies would drink and eat at banquets and barbecues and the like held out of the churches, all of which is provided by the state, of course. Politicians give speeches vying for election, including Wavebreaker, seeking to become the first prime minister of them all. Up above Crimson stands on a balcony, swirling around a glass of whiskey, sipping from it. Kelp is behind her, working on fixing up some papers in her office, moving more enthusiastically than ever before. She said she’d stop drinking recently, a sober Kelp, well, that’s quite the sight.\n\nCrimson turns her eyes downwards as slaves dance next to ex-Rangers, her loyal cultists as always having fun. She spots a jasmine colored mare trotting alongside a tea colored mare, nuzzling each other as they trot, followed by an ex-slave. A thestral mare, an ex-slave as well, would work alongside a preacher at a local church, cooking and giving away food, some mango-habanero flavored thing. A Stable pony from Stajniopolis would trot alongside a general of the armies, the two talking and having fun. Her eyes fall upon a ghoul, some refugee from Tenpony, talking to a blue unicorn with a silver mane.\n\nCrimson smiles softly, as Kelp looks over, speaking to the doctor, ‘Kelp, you knew him better than I did. Would High Tides have been happy with this? What would he have thought?’ Kelp pauses in her sorting of papers, taking a minute before speaking, ‘I think he’d be proud. But he would never admit it to you, he’d likely nitpick about how you don’t have a strong enough navy, or about how he could have done better. But I think he would be proud. I think he is proud, looking on from whatever afterlife he might have gone to.’ Crimson looks out over the celebrations, the ponies whose stories she doesn’t know, the friends she’s made, and turns her eyes finally to the coast, where ships sit in port. She looks at her drink, and grins slightly, ‘Admiral High Tides, if you didn’t die, I wouldn't be where I am today. You were a cranky ghoul. This one is for you.’ She then pours out the rest of her whiskey, down onto the street below. She sets down the glass, and turns around, giving Kelp a small grin, ‘Only eight more years, Kelp. Let’s get back to work.’"
