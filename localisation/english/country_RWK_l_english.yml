rustwreck.1.t:0 "Rustwreck seeks to renew trade-ties"
rustwreck.1.d:0 "WIP\n\nRustwreck wants to expand trade with us (Light), mainly constructing a trade-road between Valkyrie's Point and the Bend. This would be beneficial for both of us, though our Overlords (The Ringers) will likely be angry that we're trading with outside powers."
rustwreck.1.a:0 "Accept the deal"
rustwreck.1.b:0 "Reject the deal"

rustwreck.2.t:0 "Light accepts the deal"
rustwreck.2.d:0 "WIP\n\nMayor Doughnut of Light has accepted out proposal for renewed trade ties. Industry in both the Bend and Valkyrie's Point will undoubtedly increase!"
rustwreck.2.a:0 "Cooperation wins again"

rustwreck.3.t:0 "Light rejects the deal"
rustwreck.3.d:0 "WIP\n\nMayor Doughnut has rejected our generous deal. It seems there will be no new trade-road between our lands and Lights. We will reinvest the caps allocated for the construction to try and encourage settlement in the territory."
rustwreck.3.a:0 "We will survive without them"

rustwreck.4.t:0 "The Scourge of the Sea"
rustwreck.4.d:0 "WIP\n\nHigh Tides needs to decide how to deal with a band of Pirates/Raiders called the 'Razorsharks'. They have their base on an old offshore Mining-Rig that is too valuable to just bombard. Wavebreaker suggests that we simply fight the raiders on sea and on the shores until their numbers are depleted enough that they flee. Doctor Kelp, who has treated some of the Raider captives, is confident that she could strike a deal with the Raiders, wherein we pay tribute for some time, in order for them to leave the Rig and move on to other places. There is also a hastily scrawled proposal by Crimson Waters in what he hopes is just red ink. Crimson seems to think that if she can get a meeting with the raiders, she could convert them to her cult, though if we should trusts that madmare is another question."
rustwreck.4.a:0 "Let's wipe these Raiders"
rustwreck.4.b:0 "We shall spend caps, not blood"
rustwreck.4.c:0 "Let Crimson do her thing"

rustwreck.5.t:0 "Mission Accomplished"
rustwreck.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Razorsharks have been soundly beaten! Though we have taken a number of casualties ourselves the Raider threat will never rise again. Wavebreaker and some naval engineers are now inspecting the 'Orichalcum' the Mining Rig that the Razorsharks had used as their base of operations. There is certainly a lot to slavage here!"
rustwreck.5.a:0 "The Navy does not tolerate piracy!"

rustwreck.6.t:0 "Without a drop of blood shed"
rustwreck.6.d:0 "WIP\n\nThough controversial, Doctor Kelps strategy worked. After receiving the last of their tribute, the Razorsharks abandoned the mining Rig 'Orichalcum' and left peacefully. Many apploud Kelp's strategy, defeating raiders without shedding a single drop of blood on either side. Others are skeptical, especially since it appears that the Razorsharks will join up with the Rain Riders, creating a stronger foe to our north."
rustwreck.6.a:0 "Violence isn't always the answer."

rustwreck.7.t:0 "Together against he Tides"
rustwreck.7.d:0 "WIP\n\nCrimson Waters is attending a feast with members of the Endtide as well as many new converts from the Razorsharks. Stranglevine, leader of the Razorsharks is there as well. Razorshark is an utter moron has bought the Endtide's prophecy in full. Crimson will, as always, outwardly act like the crazed Cult-leader, while finding the whole affair rather unsophisticated in her inner monologue."
rustwreck.7.a:0 "Bound by blood, we are one!"

rustwreck.8.t:0 "Trade Fleet from Rustwreck"
rustwreck.8.d:0 "WIP\n\nA trade-fleet from rustwreck has arrived in our port. While we already have some trade-ties with them, they are proposing a lowering of tariffs and increased economic integration to our mutual benefit."
rustwreck.8.a:0 "Prosperity for us all"
rustwreck.8.b:0 "We shouldn't give them too much ground"

rustwreck.9.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] welcomes our Trade-Fleet"
rustwreck.9.d:0 "WIP\n\n [FROM.GetName] has agreed to increased economic cooperation and a deepening of trade ties."
rustwreck.9.a:0 "Caps make the world go round"

rustwreck.10.t:0 "All hooves to Battlestaions!"
rustwreck.10.d:0 "WIP\n\nIn March of 1035 the Celestial Sea fleet under command of Admiral Hightide was dispatched to intercept two Imperial Naval groups that were spotted near Haukland and on course for Severyana. After the disaster of 1014 the Celestial Sea fleet had to be almost entirely rebuilt, and is now sporting ships outfitted with the best Equestrian technology around (this is very late war). Near Albion, the Fleet was reinforced by Northern Air command, bringing dozens of Raptors, Skytanks and even a Thunderhead to the fight. High Tides is commanding from the Battleship HMS Sunrise. Event ends with them spotting and engaging the Zebrican Fleet in the Stepstone Sea, with High Tides deciding what to focus on."
rustwreck.10.a:0 "Hunt their Flagship, the Gloriana"
rustwreck.10.b:0 "Destroy as many vessels as possible"
rustwreck.10.c:0 "Conserve our own strength and attack carefully"

rustwreck.11.t:0 "The Long Retreat"
rustwreck.11.d:0 "The Celestial Sea Fleet failed their mission...\n\nWe failed Equestria...\n\nWhere Equestrian lasers boiled the sea and melted hulls, the Zebras responded with salvoes of hundreds of missiles that minced flesh and steel in equal measure.\nWhere tactical Megaspells ripped holes in the Zebrican formation, they were answered by balefire torpedoes that vaporized Equestrian ships without even wreckage left behind.\nThe battle was even... we could have won.\nCould have won if Northern Air Command hadn't betrayed us. By some subtle signal our air support broke of the battle as one and ascended beyond the clouds. Radio transmissions urged every Pegasus in the fleet to retreat to the clouds as well, but the Admiral ordered that our own anti-aircraft guns be used to shoot every desserter out of the sky. Few dared to try and join their feathered brothers after that. Still, without air support the battle would be a one sided slaughter. The order to retreat was given and luckily the Imperial fleet was damaged enough to not pursue.\nJust as preparations had been made to rendevouz at Albion and repair, our systems went out of control. Warning sirens went off on every ship in the fleet, striking many an unlucky sailor deaf for days after.\n\nIt had finally happened!\nThe much dreaded megaspell exchange...the end of the world.\nMinutes later, the sirens manually disabled, sickly green explosions could be seen on the mainland as zebrican Balefire Warheads destroyed everything we once held dear. An hour off the coast High Tides watched several warheads impact around Albion, shrouding the whole metropolis in necromantic fallout. Where to now? Prance? Manehattan? Fillydelphia? No, every major city and known military installation would be targeted.\nWith his homeland dying mere miles away, Admiral High Tides charted a course for the little used harbour of Redheap on the Poninsula.\nThe world was over, but on their way south, they would save what they could..."
rustwreck.11.a:0 "They loaded the ships full of civilians"
rustwreck.11.b:0 "They evacuated labs and factories"
rustwreck.11.c:0 "They scuttled every military base they came across"

rustwreck.12.t:0 "Carrying the Legacy"
rustwreck.12.d:0 "WIP\n\n10 years have passed since the world ended, and though High Tides now looks like corpse, he still refuses to die. Our sailors have renamed the little harbour of Redheap to 'Rustwreck' due to the dozens of ships we had to run up on shore. A city is growing between the wrecks, making use of the onboard purifiers and stocked supplies. High Tides has stubornly refused to scuttle more fo the fleet, but the drain on our resources to repair them all is becoming ever greater. At last, he has agreed to demilitarize most of the remaining navy, and settle in for the long haul. What exactly we'll do with the ships is still an open question though..."
rustwreck.12.a:0 "Use them for a trade-Fleet"
rustwreck.12.b:0 "Convert them to industrial use"
rustwreck.12.c:0 "Keep some as floating military bases"

rustwreck.13.t:0 "In the belly of the Beast"
rustwreck.13.d:0 "WIP\n\nHigh Tides visits the HMS Iron Shield, a derelict Cruiser that serves as the grand temple of the Cult of the Endtide. His bodyguards are nervous, but Crimson Waters and her Cultists appear ameable enough. After a quick tour, he is led to the former captains quarter which now serves as a meeting room. Crimson, as always dressed in cult attire with brown stains suggesting being splattered by blood, has a suggestion for him. She has prepared a list of Cult-members that have fallen out of favour with the leadership. If we were to blame these ponies for the recent troubles, Crimson would deal with the real perpetrators in more subtle ways. As a thanks for letting her handle things internally, she would also publicly call on the cult to support our government, which might do wonders in calming tensions."
rustwreck.13.a:0 "High Tides takes the Deal, allying with Crimson."
rustwreck.13.b:0 "Let's just take the list and use these ponies to damage the Cult."

rustwreck.14.t:0 "Like shooting Raiders in a barrel"
rustwreck.14.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe troops of the Admirality have engaged in numerous skirmishes with the Cult of the Endtide in Westshore and the Poninsula. Despite inital fears that this might spark a civil war, the cult turned out much less organized and armed than we feared. after a few days of fighting we have pushed them out of most settlements with only a few strongholds remaining that we will have to assault in full."
rustwreck.14.a:0 "No discipline like navy discipline"

rustwreck.15.t:0 "Dismantling the Warcamp"
rustwreck.15.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Cult has been crushed, Crimson captured and another threat to our peace is no more. Wavebreaker was the one who planned the assault on Crimson's Warcamp, though he did not personally take part. Dr. Kelp and her Council provided the neccessary funds and infrastructure to rebuild the town and aid the many wounded on both sides. Both of them deserve praise, but while Admiral Tides willl give them both medals, the more important question is who will get to decide on the new name of the town. Wavebreaker wants to name it after the first of our soldiers intot he breach, who heroically died in battle. Kelp wants to restore the old name of the town instead."
rustwreck.15.a:0 "Let Wavebreaker have the honor"
rustwreck.15.b:0 "Dr. Kelp should have this one"

rustwreck.16.t:0 "The Fate of Crimson Waters"
rustwreck.16.d:0 "WIP\n\nWhen we crushed the Endtide, we captured their leader, Crimson Waters. The mare has been in our brig for a few weeks now, and it's time to come to a decision. Crimson pleads for her life, arguing that the Cult was only ever a tool for political power and that she doesn't actually believe its teachings. The Admiral and Wavebreaker both want her executed for her treason, but Dr. Kelp speaks for mercy, and how much of an asset Crimson could be if she were properly loyal."
rustwreck.16.a:0 "Kelp convinces Admiral Tides"
rustwreck.16.b:0 "The traitor will be keelhauled!"

rustwreck.17.t:0 "Preaching in the Outskirts"
rustwreck.17.d:0 "WIP\n\nSince our uneasy alliance with Crimson Waters the Cult of the Endtide has become increasingly brazen in their attempts to gain more converts. This morning a group of missionaries had the gall to preach to crowds on the outskirts of our very capital. They speak of a coming second apocalypse and how we all must leave behind past affiliations and join as one to survive the Endtide. Raider apologea nonsense, of course, but some of our ponies seem to be buying into it. Should we stop them?"
rustwreck.17.a:0 "Let them preach"
rustwreck.17.b:0 "Arrest the preachers"

rustwreck.18.t:0 "Census Results"
rustwreck.18.d:0 "WIP\n\nResults from the Nationwide Census are in. Our count in Rustwreck itself was basically spot on, though there were large discrepancies in the outlying territories. Sunrise has decreased quite a lot in population, seemingly due to the failiure of a local caravan company leading to some homesteads being essentially cut off and migrating. Broken Road, the Outskirts and the Poninsula have all grown in rough accord with our predictions. Westshore however has seen a veritable population boom, largely from ponies moving their families away from the Light now that they are ruled by the Ringers. In fact, we found the new immigrants to be a great boon to local cottage industries, since mainly skilled workers who would be extorted are fleeing to our lands!"
