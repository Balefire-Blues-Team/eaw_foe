rustwreck.1.t:0 "Rustwreck seeks to renew trade-ties"
rustwreck.1.d:0 "WIP\n\nRustwreck wants to expand trade with us (Light), mainly constructing a trade-road between Valkyrie's Point and the Bend. This would be beneficial for both of us, though our Overlords (The Ringers) will likely be angry that we're trading with outside powers."
rustwreck.1.a:0 "Accept the deal"
rustwreck.1.b:0 "Reject the deal"

rustwreck.2.t:0 "Light accepts the deal"
rustwreck.2.d:0 "WIP\n\nMayor Doughnut of Light has accepted out proposal for renewed trade ties. Industry in both the Bend and Valkyrie's Point will undoubtedly increase!"
rustwreck.2.a:0 "Cooperation wins again"

rustwreck.3.t:0 "Light rejects the deal"
rustwreck.3.d:0 "WIP\n\nMayor Doughnut has rejected our generous deal. It seems there will be no new trade-road between our lands and Lights. We will reinvest the caps allocated for the construction to try and encourage settlement in the territory."
rustwreck.3.a:0 "We will survive without them"

rustwreck.4.t:0 "The Scourge of the Sea"
rustwreck.4.d:0 "WIP\n\nHigh Tides needs to decide how to deal with a band of Pirates/Raiders called the 'Razorsharks'. They have their base on an old offshore Mining-Rig that is too valuable to just bombard. Wavebreaker suggests that we simply fight the raiders on sea and on the shores until their numbers are depleted enough that they flee. Doctor Kelp, who has treated some of the Raider captives, is confident that she could strike a deal with the Raiders, wherein we pay tribute for some time, in order for them to leave the Rig and move on to other places. There is also a hastily scrawled proposal by Crimson Waters in what he hopes is just red ink. Crimson seems to think that if she can get a meeting with the raiders, she could convert them to her cult, though if we should trusts that madmare is another question."
rustwreck.4.a:0 "Let's wipe these Raiders"
rustwreck.4.b:0 "We shall spend caps, not blood"
rustwreck.4.c:0 "Let Crimson do her thing"

rustwreck.5.t:0 "Mission Accomplished"
rustwreck.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Razorsharks have been soundly beaten! Though we have taken a number of casualties ourselves the Raider threat will never rise again. Wavebreaker and some naval engineers are now inspecting the 'Orichalcum' the Mining Rig that the Razorsharks had used as their base of operations. There is certainly a lot to slavage here!"
rustwreck.5.a:0 "The Navy does not tolerate piracy!"

rustwreck.6.t:0 "Without a drop of blood shed"
rustwreck.6.d:0 "WIP\n\nThough controversial, Doctor Kelps strategy worked. After receiving the last of their tribute, the Razorsharks abandoned the mining Rig 'Orichalcum' and left peacefully. Many apploud Kelp's strategy, defeating raiders without shedding a single drop of blood on either side. Others are skeptical, especially since it appears that the Razorsharks will join up with the Rain Riders, creating a stronger foe to our north."
rustwreck.6.a:0 "Violence isn't always the answer."

rustwreck.7.t:0 "Together against he Tides"
rustwreck.7.d:0 "WIP\n\nCrimson Waters is attending a feast with members of the Endtide as well as many new converts from the Razorsharks. Stranglevine, leader of the Razorsharks is there as well. Razorshark is an utter moron has bought the Endtide's prophecy in full. Crimson will, as always, outwardly act like the crazed Cult-leader, while finding the whole affair rather unsophisticated in her inner monologue."
rustwreck.7.a:0 "Bound by blood, we are one!"

rustwreck.8.t:0 "Trade Fleet from Rustwreck"
rustwreck.8.d:0 "WIP\n\nA trade-fleet from rustwreck has arrived in our port. While we already have some trade-ties with them, they are proposing a lowering of tariffs and increased economic integration to our mutual benefit."
rustwreck.8.a:0 "Prosperity for us all"
rustwreck.8.b:0 "We shouldn't give them too much ground"

rustwreck.9.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] welcomes our Trade-Fleet"
rustwreck.9.d:0 "WIP\n\n [FROM.GetName] has agreed to increased economic cooperation and a deepening of trade ties."
rustwreck.9.a:0 "Caps make the world go round"

rustwreck.10.t:0 "All hooves to Battlestaions!"
rustwreck.10.d:0 "WIP\n\nIn March of 1035 the Celestial Sea fleet under command of Admiral Hightide was dispatched to intercept two Imperial Naval groups that were spotted near Haukland and on course for Severyana. After the disaster of 1014 the Celestial Sea fleet had to be almost entirely rebuilt, and is now sporting ships outfitted with the best Equestrian technology around (this is very late war). Near Albion, the Fleet was reinforced by Northern Air command, bringing dozens of Raptors, Skytanks and even a Thunderhead to the fight. High Tides is commanding from the Battleship HMS Sunrise. Event ends with them spotting and engaging the Zebrican Fleet in the Stepstone Sea, with High Tides deciding what to focus on."
rustwreck.10.a:0 "Hunt their Flagship, the Gloriana"
rustwreck.10.b:0 "Destroy as many vessels as possible"
rustwreck.10.c:0 "Conserve our own strength and attack carefully"

rustwreck.11.t:0 "The Long Retreat"
rustwreck.11.d:0 "The Celestial Sea Fleet failed their mission...\n\nWe failed Equestria...\n\nWhere Equestrian lasers boiled the sea and melted hulls, the Zebras responded with salvoes of hundreds of missiles that minced flesh and steel in equal measure.\nWhere tactical Megaspells ripped holes in the Zebrican formation, they were answered by balefire torpedoes that vaporized Equestrian ships without even wreckage left behind.\nThe battle was even... we could have won.\nCould have won if Northern Air Command hadn't betrayed us. By some subtle signal our air support broke of the battle as one and ascended beyond the clouds. Radio transmissions urged every Pegasus in the fleet to retreat to the clouds as well, but the Admiral ordered that our own anti-aircraft guns be used to shoot every desserter out of the sky. Few dared to try and join their feathered brothers after that. Still, without air support the battle would be a one sided slaughter. The order to retreat was given and luckily the Imperial fleet was damaged enough to not pursue.\nJust as preparations had been made to rendevouz at Albion and repair, our systems went out of control. Warning sirens went off on every ship in the fleet, striking many an unlucky sailor deaf for days after.\n\nIt had finally happened!\nThe much dreaded megaspell exchange...the end of the world.\nMinutes later, the sirens manually disabled, sickly green explosions could be seen on the mainland as zebrican Balefire Warheads destroyed everything we once held dear. An hour off the coast High Tides watched several warheads impact around Albion, shrouding the whole metropolis in necromantic fallout. Where to now? Prance? Manehattan? Fillydelphia? No, every major city and known military installation would be targeted.\nWith his homeland dying mere miles away, Admiral High Tides charted a course for the little used harbour of Redheap on the Poninsula.\nThe world was over, but on their way south, they would save what they could..."
rustwreck.11.a:0 "They loaded the ships full of civilians"
rustwreck.11.b:0 "They evacuated labs and factories"
rustwreck.11.c:0 "They scuttled every military base they came across"

rustwreck.12.t:0 "Carrying the Legacy"
rustwreck.12.d:0 "WIP\n\n10 years have passed since the world ended, and though High Tides now looks like corpse, he still refuses to die. Our sailors have renamed the little harbour of Redheap to 'Rustwreck' due to the dozens of ships we had to run up on shore. A city is growing between the wrecks, making use of the onboard purifiers and stocked supplies. High Tides has stubornly refused to scuttle more fo the fleet, but the drain on our resources to repair them all is becoming ever greater. At last, he has agreed to demilitarize most of the remaining navy, and settle in for the long haul. What exactly we'll do with the ships is still an open question though..."
rustwreck.12.a:0 "Use them for a trade-Fleet"
rustwreck.12.b:0 "Convert them to industrial use"
rustwreck.12.c:0 "Keep some as floating military bases"

rustwreck.13.t:0 "In the belly of the Beast"
rustwreck.13.d:0 "WIP\n\nHigh Tides visits the HMS Iron Shield, a derelict Cruiser that serves as the grand temple of the Cult of the Endtide. His bodyguards are nervous, but Crimson Waters and her Cultists appear ameable enough. After a quick tour, he is led to the former captains quarter which now serves as a meeting room. Crimson, as always dressed in cult attire with brown stains suggesting being splattered by blood, has a suggestion for him. She has prepared a list of Cult-members that have fallen out of favour with the leadership. If we were to blame these ponies for the recent troubles, Crimson would deal with the real perpetrators in more subtle ways. As a thanks for letting her handle things internally, she would also publicly call on the cult to support our government, which might do wonders in calming tensions."
rustwreck.13.a:0 "High Tides takes the Deal, allying with Crimson."
rustwreck.13.b:0 "Let's just take the list and use these ponies to damage the Cult."

rustwreck.14.t:0 "Like shooting Raiders in a barrel"
rustwreck.14.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe troops of the Admirality have engaged in numerous skirmishes with the Cult of the Endtide in Westshore and the Poninsula. Despite inital fears that this might spark a civil war, the cult turned out much less organized and armed than we feared. after a few days of fighting we have pushed them out of most settlements with only a few strongholds remaining that we will have to assault in full."
rustwreck.14.a:0 "No discipline like navy discipline"

rustwreck.15.t:0 "Dismantling the Warcamp"
rustwreck.15.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Cult has been crushed, Crimson captured and another threat to our peace is no more. Wavebreaker was the one who planned the assault on Crimson's Warcamp, though he did not personally take part. Dr. Kelp and her Council provided the neccessary funds and infrastructure to rebuild the town and aid the many wounded on both sides. Both of them deserve praise, but while Admiral Tides willl give them both medals, the more important question is who will get to decide on the new name of the town. Wavebreaker wants to name it after the first of our soldiers intot he breach, who heroically died in battle. Kelp wants to restore the old name of the town instead."
rustwreck.15.a:0 "Let Wavebreaker have the honor"
rustwreck.15.b:0 "Dr. Kelp should have this one"

rustwreck.16.t:0 "The Fate of Crimson Waters"
rustwreck.16.d:0 "WIP\n\nWhen we crushed the Endtide, we captured their leader, Crimson Waters. The mare has been in our brig for a few weeks now, and it's time to come to a decision. Crimson pleads for her life, arguing that the Cult was only ever a tool for political power and that she doesn't actually believe its teachings. The Admiral and Wavebreaker both want her executed for her treason, but Dr. Kelp speaks for mercy, and how much of an asset Crimson could be if she were properly loyal."
rustwreck.16.a:0 "Kelp convinces Admiral Tides"
rustwreck.16.b:0 "The traitor will be keelhauled!"

rustwreck.17.t:0 "Preaching in the Outskirts"
rustwreck.17.d:0 "WIP\n\nSince our uneasy alliance with Crimson Waters the Cult of the Endtide has become increasingly brazen in their attempts to gain more converts. This morning a group of missionaries had the gall to preach to crowds on the outskirts of our very capital. They speak of a coming second apocalypse and how we all must leave behind past affiliations and join as one to survive the Endtide. Raider apologea nonsense, of course, but some of our ponies seem to be buying into it. Should we stop them?"
rustwreck.17.a:0 "Let them preach"
rustwreck.17.b:0 "Arrest the preachers"

rustwreck.18.t:0 "Census Results"
rustwreck.18.d:0 "WIP\n\nResults from the Nationwide Census are in. Our count in Rustwreck itself was basically spot on, though there were large discrepancies in the outlying territories. Sunrise has decreased quite a lot in population, seemingly due to the failiure of a local caravan company leading to some homesteads being essentially cut off and migrating. Broken Road, the Outskirts and the Poninsula have all grown in rough accord with our predictions. Westshore however has seen a veritable population boom, largely from ponies moving their families away from the Light now that they are ruled by the Ringers. In fact, we found the new immigrants to be a great boon to local cottage industries, since mainly skilled workers who would be extorted are fleeing to our lands!"
rustwreck.18.a:0 "Fascinating"

rustwreck.19.t:0 "War or Peace"
rustwreck.19.d:0 "WIP\n\nWith our attention finally turning to the Equestrian mainland, we will radically need to increase our industrial potential. The first question is, if we want to gear our industry for an early war, or build up a stable civilian base first?"
rustwreck.19.a:0 "War"
rustwreck.19.b:0 "Peace"

rustwreck.20.t:0 "Borderwar - Victory"
rustwreck.20.d:0 "WIP\n\nWe won our border over Boosterjuice (state name). We succeeded in crossing the Hoofsic and pushing pack the raiders on the other side. Now our northern border-towns are finally safe from the Rain Riders."
rustwreck.20.a:0 "Excellent!"

rustwreck.21.t:0 "Borderwar - Loss"
rustwreck.21.d:0 "WIP\n\nWe failed to push back the Rain Riders. Not only were our troops stalled at the the Hoofsic River, but the raiders actually used our attack as an opportunity to raid behind our lines, devastating the Broken Road."
rustwreck.21.a:0 "We'll get them next time"

rustwreck.22.t:0 "Borderwar - No Movement"
rustwreck.22.d:0 "WIP\n\nDespite our best efforts, the raiders were too entrenched along the Hoofsic. We were unable to cross the river and push them back, but their counterattack also shattered against the defenses of Fort Wavebreak. It seems we are at a stalemate for now."
rustwreck.22.a:0 "Rearm, retrain, retry."

rustwreck.23.t:0 "The Burdens of Age"
rustwreck.23.d:0 "WIP\n\nEvent 1 in the Sickness Event-line\nAdmiral High Tides is inspecting a refurbished navy ship and talking with an officer when he suddenly starts to forget words. He catches himself but a few minutes later he is by dizzyness and has to call off the inspection. It seems 200 years of age are starting to catch up, even with a ghoul."
rustwreck.23.a:0 "Some meds will fix this."

rustwreck.24.t:0 "Out of Commission"
rustwreck.24.d:0 "WIP\n\nEvent 2 of the Sickness Event-line\nHigh Tides woke up feeling... sick this morning. He hasn't felt sick in almost 200 years, not since he became a ghoul. But this morning he has a massive migrane and his legs feel too weak to carry him. Despite his protests Dr. Kelp order a week of bedrest for him, until she finds out what sort of illness could affect even a Ghoul. While he's out of commission, High Tides orders Wavebreaker to take over the day-to-day."
rustwreck.24.a:0 "A sick ghoul? Scary."

rustwreck.25.t:0 "Diagnosis"
rustwreck.25.d:0 "WIP\n\nEvent 3 of the Sickness Event-line\nDr. Kelp gives the Admiral his diagnosis. Despite how good he's held up on the outside for a ghoul, his insides have been rotting away, and at long last it has reached his brain. He will soon turn feral and loose every shred of sanity he has left. Dr. Kelp will do her best to delay the onset, but even she can only do so much. The Admiral has a few months of sanity left."
rustwreck.25.a:0 "We need to keep this secret"

rustwreck.26.t:0 "Pain"
rustwreck.26.d:0 "WIP\n\nEvent 4 of the Sickness Event-line\nThe pain of the admiral is unimaginable. Some days he is barely lucent, others he switches from moments of metnal clarity to pain that leaves even a hardened veteran like him writhing and screaming. The doctors had to restrain him after he tried to bite a nurse during one of his episodes. However, Dr. Kelp believe she might be able to freeze the effects of Feralization. A coctail of drugs, rad-enriched substances and copious amounts of magical healing might do the trick, but will also be horrifically painful to apply. In the end it is the admirals choice if he wants her to try."
rustwreck.26.a:0 "Do it!"
rustwreck.26.b:0 "Just let me die..."

rustwreck.27.t:0 "The Treatment"
rustwreck.27.d:0 "WIP\n\nPotential Ending for the Sickness Event-line\nDr. Kelp applies the experimental, the only people in the room other than her are the Admiral and some nurses. High Tides struggles and screams as the treatment is administered and has to be tied down. After about 10 minutes he fall quiet and goes unresponsive. A medical examination spell confimers that the treatment worked, just not perfectly. The onset of Feralization has been stopped, but during the struggle a blood vessel in the Admiral's brain burst, causing him to fall into a catatonic state. He's still alive, but will never wake again."
rustwreck.27.a:0 "Damn, this is gonna be a problem"

rustwreck.28.t:0 "Emergency Powers"
rustwreck.28.d:0 "WIP\n\nHigh Tides is catatonic, and Dr. Kelp is at fault. Without the admirals tempering influence, Kelp is sure that either Wavebreaker of Crimson Waters will plunge the nation into an age of conflict, if they don't start a civil war over who gets to rule first. To prevent this, Dr. Kelp has called a hasty meeting with the more moderate voices in the capital. The Members of the Sunrise Development Council are all in attendance, along with (Griffon Sailor) and his supporters and even some of the doveish members of the New Admirality. The Discussion lasts into the Night, but at long last it is decided that Dr. Kelp will be granted emergency powers to keep the nation stable and at peace."
rustwreck.28.a:0 "Let's hope none try for a coup"

rustwreck.29.t:0 "The Compromise"
rustwreck.29.d:0 "WIP\n\nWavebreaker has rallied sailors and the Royal Marines to his side and is occupying the Harbour of Rustwreck as well as the old Admirality building. Opposing them are hastily formed milita battalions, parts of the army loyal to the Sunrise Council and those aligned with (Griffon Sailor). No shots were fired so far, and Dr. Kelp intends to keep it that way. She is meeting with Wavebreaker in the Harbourmaster's office, both of them tense and sleep-deprived. Kelp will offer Wavebreaker control over the admirality and the option to keep his current rank. Wavebreaker would become Admiral, but the nation ceases to be an Admirality. She points out that any conflict between the two of them would just weaken the nation for the Ringers to move in unopposed. Wavebreaker eventually accepts."
rustwreck.29.a:0 "Crisis averted."

rustwreck.30.t:0 "Separation of Church and State"
rustwreck.30.d:0 "WIP\n\nCrimson Waters and her Cult of the Endtide have made quite the mess of our outlying territories while we were busy preventing a civil war with the New Admirality. Now Crimson is in a good position to negotiate, but we hold the Capital, the Navy and the Royal Marines. In order to prevent a bloodbath, Dr. Kelp has drawn up a piece of legislation that should appease the Cult. The Cult of the Endtide would be recognized as an organized religion and allowed to operate openly in the nation. They would also be granted some seats in the Council to shape future policies and decisions. To everypony's relief Crimson accepts the terms."
rustwreck.30.a:0 "Freedom, even for the Cultists."

rustwreck.31.t:0 "Blood or Steel?"
rustwreck.31.d:0 "WIP\n\nHigh Tides can feel his mind fading, today might very well be one of his last lucid days left. He sends for his Protegé Wavebreaker and his challenger Crimson Waters. Just a few months prior Wavebreaker would have been his one and only choice. Maybe it was Red Eye's conquests that scared him, maybe it was teh spectre of his own mortality, or maybe it was simply the disease eating away at his sanity, but a ruthless and blooded leader might Crimson didn't seem such a bad idea to him anymore. He spends a few hours talking with both of them, before calling in his staff and declaring his official successor..."
rustwreck.31.a:0 "Wavebreaker"
rustwreck.31.b:0 "Crimson Waters"

rustwreck.32.t:0 "The Prodigal Son"
rustwreck.32.d:0 "WIP\n\nAn oversized and dilapidated Barge was spotted on course to Rustwreck by one of our Patrols. Over radio they identified themselves as the (Ship Name), appearing friendly enough. When we came into visual range, we found the most astonishing thing: Some of the crew are members of our Griffonian Expedition that went missing nearly 20 years ago! Not only that, the captain of this ship, a certain (Griffon Sailor) claims to be the adopted son of the late Commodore Seafoam. We have escorted them to port, for it seems they have quite the tale to tell."
rustwreck.32.a:0 "This is quite unusual"

rustwreck.33.t:0 "Time claims us all"
rustwreck.33.d:0 "WIP\n\nDespite Dr. Kelps best efforts, the Admiral has gone feral. In an act of mercy sancioned by the Admirality, a drug cocktail was administered to High Tides that killed him painlessly. A national day of mourning has been announced by the Admirality, though behind the scenes Crimson Waters and Wavebreaker are both scrambling to mobilize their supporters and secure power in the nation."
rustwreck.33.a:0 "May he rest in peace"

rustwreck.34.t:0 "Succession"
rustwreck.34.d:0 "WIP\n\nCrimson Waters has managed to claim power. When Wavebreaker's troops tried to rouse from their barracks this morning, they found their bases surrounded by armed members of the Cult of the Endtide. Wavebreaker was temporarily placed under house arrest, and the old admirality building was stormed against only a handful of resisting guards. The swift takeover only cause 7 deaths throughout the nation, but power is firmly in the hooves of Crimson Waters and der Cultists."
rustwreck.34.a:0 "Tide have mercy on us!"

rustwreck.35.t:0 "Succession"
rustwreck.35.d:0 "WIP\n\nWhat most knew would happen did indeed come to pass. Wavebreaker officially took the office of Admiral and with it command over all of Rustwreck. In a smooth transition of power 200 years of entrenched positions were reshuffled. With him ascending to power, the distinction between the Old and New Admirality is moot now, as both are under Wavebreaker's control."

rustwreck.36.d:0 "WIP\n\nCrimson and Dr. Kelp are waiting in High Tide's old office in the Admirality. Reluctant though she was to help, Kelp provided a dozen or so names to the list of those that must die today. Ponies that, under no circumstances, support the new government. Ponies with strong connections abroad. Ponies known for strong belief in other religions, and the list went on. The admirality was excempt, for now, as they still had enough guns on their ships to level the capital in a day. Still, most enemies of the new regime would be dead by daylight. Kelp drowned her guilt in the Admirals pre-war whiskey, while Crimson flipped through folders of Admirality records, marking officers that would live, die or be dismissed once the next stage arrived. Note that Kelp is really fucking miserable about the whole situation."
rustwreck.36.a:0 "...So others may live"

rustwreck.37.t:0 "Ship Amok!"
rustwreck.37.d:0 "WIP\n\nIn the process of slowly subverting the Admirality, one of our agents seems to have made a mistake. We have no idea what it was, for the agent is dead now, but it caused the Captain of the Frigate HMS Valiant to open fire into the Harbour of Rustwreck, and the Admirality building. As it was evening, most workers had already left work at this point, so the toll in dead and injured is rather low, but it is still a shock to the capital. After about 15 minutes of firing, we were able to scramble a squad with a competent mage and board the Valiant via teleportation. Most sailors surrendered, but the captain and three others refused and died in the ensuing gunfight."
rustwreck.37.a:0 "What a childish tantrum"

rustwreck.38.t:0 "With friends like these"
rustwreck.38.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe sun is setting as Crimson and Wavebreaker are hunched over a table with hundreds of plastic soldiers strewn about it. Downhaul observed both ponies' moves closely. He still hadn't quite figured out the rules of the game, but was getting better at it. Dr. Kelp was also present, and though she understood the game, she was already on her fourth glass of Grog and thus not very helpful. They had started playing a few weeks ago, reluctantly at first but with wins and losses for both parties genuine animosity had turned to friendly rivalry. It still felt surreal what was happening to Rustwreck but Downhaul had stopped fretting a while ago and simply decided to try and nudge the cult into the right direction. He figured Kelp and Wavebreaker were likely doing the same thing. 'I got you now!' Crimson exclaimed, rolling 3 sixes which apparently meant that her ramshackle tank had destroyed Wavebreaker's oversized boxy pony-mech."

rustwreck.39.t:0 "An Artificial Metropolis"
rustwreck.39.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe inner Circle of the Cult as well as several economists and high-ranking military staff are meeting in a recently refurbished office building in Saltpan. They discuss the necessety to create an unassailable capital, capable of enough industrial and scientific output to pull the entire nation in it's wake. Crimson has drawn up plans to relocate ponies and factories to Rustwreck from various conquered territories. Most of her inner circle supports the idea, though there is disagreement about the extend of relocation. The only opposing voices are Dr. Kelp and a small cadre of economists around her that argue any such large-scale relocation and 'assimilation' would be tantamount to cultural genocide."

rustwreck.40.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe former Warcamp from which the Cult of the Endtide operated is being turned into a large military base to train the next generation of soldiers and officers for the Tidebound military. Crimson and her Advisors are debating what to name the new Fort. A particularly sycophantic priest suggest we name it after Crimson herself. Dr. Kelp proposes we name it Aestus, the old ponish word for tide. Wavebreaker wants us to name it after the late Admiral High Tide, to honor his memory and mend some of the divisions between the old and new administrations."

rustwreck.41.d:0 "WIP\n\nMerchant from Tenpony Tower is negociating with an Official of the Cult of the Endtide in Sunrise Shipping HQ. The Merchant is trying to buy a few dozen blood bags the priesthood provides, but the Cult official insists on being paid in Scrip, not caps. The Merchant eventually relents and trades some of his caps for scrip to pay for the blood, but after the deal still has scrip left over that he can't really spend anywhere else in the wasteland."

rustwreck.42.d:0 "WIP\n\nOne of our Squadrons, laden with slaves after a sucessful raid in the Southeast, made a stop in Baltimare to restock supplies and sell of the various treasures they looted along from the villages they struck. The Captain of one of our ships struck it off with a higher up of one of Baltimare's Crime families, leading to an invitation. The Squadron ended up staying 3 days longer than planned in the city. Many of our sailors were dazzled by the nightlife of the City and the massive amount of chems available for scarily cheap prices. The stay ended with an exchange of gifts and an amicable farewell."
