rustwreck.1.t:0 "Rustwreck seeks to renew trade-ties"
rustwreck.1.d:0 "Earlier today, our halls of power received a visitor, a low ranking sailor called Crows Nest from Rustwreck, proposing we build up a trade route between Valkyrie’s Point and The Bend. Now Rustwreck isn’t exactly an economic powerhouse, but they’ve still got a lot of stuff, and caps, that we’d like to get our hooves on. Of course, The Ringers aren’t going to be very happy to hear we’re trading outside of ‘The Family’, might even see it as undermining their power.\n\nWhat’s undeniable is that this deal will help both of us and would provide a big economic boost. We could use that boost to try and jumpstart our economy, either to become a better partner to The Ringers, or to strike out on our own. On the other hoof, The Ringers will be angry, and they’ve protected us. It’s like that saying, don’t bite the hoof that feeds you, never know when that offering might become a punch. Either way, we’ve got a choice to make."
rustwreck.1.a:0 "Accept the deal"
rustwreck.1.b:0 "Reject the deal"

rustwreck.2.t:0 "Light accepts the deal"
rustwreck.2.d:0 "REPORT: LIGHT TRADE AGREEMENT:\n\nMessenger CROWS NEST has arrived back from LIGHT from discussions on the creation of a trade route between VALKYRIE'S POINT and THE BEND. MAYOR DOUGHNUT has responded with an affirmative yes, meaning that construction of a trade route between VALKYRIE’S POINT and THE BEND can now begin, which will boost industry in both areas. Reports indicate THE RINGERS are unhappy with us for 'undermining' their 'family', a possible issue for later.\n\nThis is a good turn of events and exactly what we wanted to happen. This trade will be the start to massive economic growth. No major incidents reported, construction set to begin within the week."
rustwreck.2.a:0 "Cooperation wins again"

rustwreck.3.t:0 "Light rejects the deal"
rustwreck.3.d:0 "WIP\n\nMayor Doughnut has rejected our generous deal. It seems there will be no new trade-road between our lands and Lights. We will reinvest the caps allocated for the construction to try and encourage settlement in the territory."
rustwreck.3.a:0 "We will survive without them"

rustwreck.4.t:0 "The Scourge of the Sea"
rustwreck.4.d:0 "It’s a muggy and windy day in Rustwreck, as it always is. High Tides paced back and forth through his spacious office, glancing out the window every so often. A raider gang, pirates, more like, called the Razorsharks, have taken over an offshore mining rig, and much as he’d love to just shell them, that thing is just too valuable to damage or lose. Of course everypony has come up with their own ideas on how to solve this issue, from the more reasonable to the outright insane.\n\nWavebreaker put forward the most sane and normal proposal, requesting that our forces should simply engage the raiders at sea and on shore until we wear them down enough to force them to flee. Killing is what everyone else does to raiders, it’s what they deserve, it’s the most straight-forward path to victory. But of course, doing this would lose good sailors, ponies with families, jobs, dying against some monstrous scum of Equestria.\n\nDoctor Kelp, in all her doctorly confidence, has proposed a pacifistic solution. She’s treated some raiders we took captive before, talked to them, knows them, says they aren’t as scummy as we think, that if she could talk to them she could convince them to leave with some money. Not only does this require us to pay those freaks, but it puts our best Doctor at risk, and it just pushes the problem down the road. She seems confident, but overconfidence has killed many a so-called 'intellectual'.\n\nCrimson Waters rushed her proposal, written in red ink, well, hopefully that’s ink, never know with that psycho. Her proposal is to send her to a meeting and have her convince the raiders to join her cult. This would get rid of the raiders, and if it fails, Tartarus, it might get rid of her too, not the worst outcome. Worst outcome is she succeeds, then not only do we have more cultists, but cultists with experience. Whatever. A decision has to be made.."
rustwreck.4.a:0 "Let's wipe these Raiders"

rustwreck.5.t:0 "Mission Accomplished"
rustwreck.5.d:0 "REPORT: OPERATION DULL RAZOR:\n\nRUSTWRECK’S navy and our loyal sailors and soldiers have ventured out to face the raider threat known as the RAZORSHARKS. Reports indicate VICTORY, as the RAZORSHARKS have been defeated with only minor losses to our side. The RAZORSHARKS have been hunted down and destroyed and are sure to never threaten our shores before. \n\nThe MINING RIG, ORICHALCHUM, has been taken over and scavenging teams have been hard at work scavenging through it and finding everything of value to RUSTWRECK and our glorious mission. Preliminary searches have reported valuable materials being found aboard ORICHALCUM, which is being inspected further by naval engineers. Further scavenging teams shall see what more hides. No major incidents reported, scavenging to continue."
rustwreck.5.a:0 "The Navy does not tolerate piracy!"

rustwreck.6.t:0 "Without a drop of blood shed"
rustwreck.6.d:0 "Reports have come in from Doctor Kelp, not done in the proper format expected of a report, but that’s what happens when a civilian like her writes. The raiders have left the Orichalcum, the name of the mining rig they inhabited, and not a single drop of blood was spilled. Of course, it cost us a pretty cap, but is money worth more than lives? Maybe. Especially since it looks like those pirate scum are heading north, to the Rain Riders’ territory, meaning we’ll have to keep a close eye on them.\n\nOf course Doctor Kelp has gotten praise from all around ever since she got back, ponies are happy their sons and husbands aren’t sailing out to fight pirates. Even those sceptical of her have kept their mouths shut, just watching the shores with slight worry. Of course she hasn’t let it get to her head, no, and that makes it all the worse, a quiet arrogance by not being arrogant about an achievement. If we end up seeing some of those pirates in a Rain Riders’ raid, gonna make sure that Kelp sees them, knows that her victory wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows."
rustwreck.6.a:0 "Violence isn't always the answer."

rustwreck.7.t:0 "Together against he Tides"
rustwreck.7.d:0 "Feasts, they’ve been the gathering place of ponies since the beginning of history, where enemies can sit and break bread with each other, sort out their differences in a quiet, sophisticated manner. Yet here we stand amongst brothers, sisters, followers and lackeys and those few golden who question yet follow anyway, and the feast is so… sloppy. Slobbering Raiders, shouting and drinking without a care in the world, so loud. Crimson stands and watches as her many cult members talk with the new converts, including Stranglevine, the raider leader who’s fully bought into it all. He’s a fool who’s not taken a single second to think, merely following the first pony who offered a hoof. A mutt, and that’s being unkind to dogs. They shout and talk of the wonders of all the cult has to offer, but they’re nothing but snakes in the grass, to turn so easily was a sign of weakness, not a sign of strength.\n\nShe would saunter out from the door she stood behind, and like that the feast would become quiet, as all look over at her. She flicks her mane to the side, clearing her eyes to look at each and every one of them, before putting on a practised grin and happy expression, ‘My brothers and my sisters, my lovely ponies from every trot of life, I am so happy you’ve accepted your new siblings in faith so readily. Stranglevine here was so attentive when I told him everything about the Endtide, following my every word like a do.. Ahem, a loyal hound eager to learn from its master, the perfect member!’ Her words are met with a cheer, as she scoops up a drink, hopping up onto the table, scattering around plates of food, holding it up with a wide smirk, ‘To our new brothers and sisters, converts to the truth, to the wondrous world they’ve opened their eyes to, to me, who shared with them the truth so freely, so readily! My followers, my beloved ponies, my friends and my family, raise a glass, raise a mug, raise your voice, all together we welcome them! Bound by blood, we are one!"

rustwreck.10.d:0 "WIP\n\nIn March of 1035 the Celestial Sea fleet under command of Admiral Hightide was dispatched to intercept two Imperial Naval groups that were spotted near Haukland and on course for Severyana. After the disaster of 1014 the Celestial Sea fleet had to be almost entirely rebuilt, and is now sporting ships outfitted with the best Equestrian technology around (this is very late war). Near Albion, the Fleet was reinforced by Northern Air command, bringing dozens of Raptors, Skytanks and even a Thunderhead to the fight. High Tides is commanding from the Battleship HMS Sunrise. Event ends with them spotting and engaging the Zebrican Fleet in the Stepstone Sea, with High Tides deciding what to focus on."

rustwreck.11.d:0 "The Celestial Sea Fleet failed their mission...\n\nWe failed Equestria...\n\nWhere Equestrian lasers boiled the sea and melted hulls, the Zebras responded with salvoes of hundreds of missiles that minced flesh and steel in equal measure.\nWhere tactical Megaspells ripped holes in the Zebrican formation, they were answered by balefire torpedoes that vaporized Equestrian ships without even wreckage left behind.\nThe battle was even... we could have won.\nCould have won if Northern Air Command hadn't betrayed us. By some subtle signal our air support broke of the battle as one and ascended beyond the clouds. Radio transmissions urged every Pegasus in the fleet to retreat to the clouds as well, but the Admiral ordered that our own anti-aircraft guns be used to shoot every desserter out of the sky. Few dared to try and join their feathered brothers after that. Still, without air support the battle would be a one sided slaughter. The order to retreat was given and luckily the Imperial fleet was damaged enough to not pursue.\nJust as preparations had been made to rendevouz at Albion and repair, our systems went out of control. Warning sirens went off on every ship in the fleet, striking many an unlucky sailor deaf for days after.\n\nIt had finally happened!\nThe much dreaded megaspell exchange...the end of the world.\nMinutes later, the sirens manually disabled, sickly green explosions could be seen on the mainland as zebrican Balefire Warheads destroyed everything we once held dear. An hour off the coast High Tides watched several warheads impact around Albion, shrouding the whole metropolis in necromantic fallout. Where to now? Prance? Manehattan? Fillydelphia? No, every major city and known military installation would be targeted.\nWith his homeland dying mere miles away, Admiral High Tides charted a course for the little used harbour of Redheap on the Poninsula.\nThe world was over, but on their way south, they would save what they could..."

rustwreck.12.d:0 "WIP\n\n10 years have passed since the world ended, and though High Tides now looks like corpse, he still refuses to die. Our sailors have renamed the little harbour of Redheap to 'Rustwreck' due to the dozens of ships we had to run up on shore. A city is growing between the wrecks, making use of the onboard purifiers and stocked supplies. High Tides has stubornly refused to scuttle more fo the fleet, but the drain on our resources to repair them all is becoming ever greater. At last, he has agreed to demilitarize most of the remaining navy, and settle in for the long haul. What exactly we'll do with the ships is still an open question though..."

rustwreck.13.t:0 "In the belly of the Beast"
rustwreck.13.d:0 "HMS Iron Shield, once a great enforcer of Equestrian power, Luna’s long-reaching hoof, even if just a cruiser, has now become a derelict hive of scum and psychopathic freaks, otherwise known as the Cult of the Endtide. High Tides would be given a tour after a surprisingly cordial meeting with the Cult, though his bodyguards retain a quiet vigilance, you never know with cultists, after all. He made a show of correcting the cultist giving the tour at every point, after all, he knows damn well what a cruiser’s inside looks like and he doesn’t need some freak to explain it to him like he’s never seen it before. Each correction would make his guards tense slightly and prepare for lashback, but none would ever come, the cultist laughing it off and continuing the tour. Being laughed at only put High Tides in an even worse mood, and he had to suppress many, many violent feelings before the tour ended.\n\nNow stood in a meeting room, once a captain’s quarters, he met Crimson Waters, head freak, dressed in a disgusting robe with brown stains all over it, probably blood considering it’s this psycho. Her stance is terrible too, like one of those pansy Army generals who got in through birth, confident and theatrical, the type of pony he’d like to give a lashing if they ever got on his ship. Crimson surprised him, though, because as soon as everypony else left, she would begin to speak more normally, giving him an offer to end all the recent trouble.\n\nShe gave him a list, a list of names, fake troublemakers who Crimson wants to take the blame so she can deal with the actual perpetrators more subtly. Given she’s the leader of the freaks who caused the trouble to begin with, this offer first came off as extremely rude, arrogant even, and it took until Tides was shouting and growling at her that she fully explained. Do this for her, trust her, let her take care of it, and the cult will align with the state, calming tensions. Just take the list and blame them, let her do the work, and calm everything down.\n\nHigh Tides’ voice sounded more raspy than normal as he talked over the deal, a pounding in the back of his head telling him to just kill her for even thinking she can offer him this poisoned deal. But her cult is big, it could be helpful to have on his side, even if the freaks are psychos. Of course, she’s also giving him a list of ponies she doesn’t like, or is even scared of, it’d be easy to just go to them, make them work against her. As she flashed him a final, confident smirk, he’d be left to make the choice in a second of thought."

Dr. Kelp and her Council provided the neccessary funds and infrastructure to rebuild the town and aid the many wounded on both sides. Both of them deserve praise, but while Admiral Tides willl give them both medals, the more important question is who will get to decide on the new name of the town. Wavebreaker wants to name it after the first of our soldiers intot he breach, who heroically died in battle. Kelp wants to restore the old name of the town instead."

They speak of a coming second apocalypse and how we all must leave behind past affiliations and join as one to survive the Endtide.

Sunrise has decreased quite a lot in population, seemingly due to the failiure of a local caravan company leading to some homesteads being essentially cut off and migrating. Broken Road, the Outskirts and the Poninsula have all grown in rough accord with our predictions. Westshore however has seen a veritable population boom, largely from ponies moving their families away from the Light now that they are ruled by the Ringers. In fact, we found the new immigrants to be a great boon to local cottage industries, since mainly skilled workers who would be extorted are fleeing to our lands!"

The doctors had to restrain him after he tried to bite a nurse during one of his episodes. However, Dr. Kelp believe she might be able to freeze the effects of Feralization. A coctail of drugs, rad-enriched substances and copious amounts of magical healing might do the trick, but will also be horrifically painful to apply.

A medical examination spell confimers that the treatment worked, just not perfectly.

To prevent this, Dr. Kelp has called a hasty meeting with the more moderate voices in the capital. The Members of the Sunrise Development Council are all in attendance, along with (Griffon Sailor) and his supporters and even some of the doveish members of the New Admirality.

No shots were fired so far, and Dr. Kelp intends to keep it that way. She is meeting with Wavebreaker in the Harbourmaster's office, both of them tense and sleep-deprived. Kelp will offer Wavebreaker control over the admirality and the option to keep his current rank. Wavebreaker would become Admiral, but the nation ceases to be an Admirality.

In order to prevent a bloodbath, Dr. Kelp has drawn up a piece of legislation that should appease the Cult. The Cult of the Endtide would be recognized as an organized religion and allowed to operate openly in the nation.

Ponies with strong connections abroad. Ponies known for strong belief in other religions, and the list went on. The admirality was excempt, for now, as they still had enough guns on their ships to level the capital in a day. Still, most enemies of the new regime would be dead by daylight. Kelp drowned her guilt in the Admirals pre-war whiskey, while Crimson flipped through folders of Admirality records, marking officers that would live, die or be dismissed once the next stage arrived.

As it was evening, most workers had already left work at this point, so the toll in dead and injured is rather low, but it is still a shock to the capital. After about 15 minutes of firing, we were able to scramble a squad with a competent mage and board the Valiant via teleportation.

Dr. Kelp was also present, and though she understood the game, she was already on her fourth glass of Grog and thus not very helpful. They had started playing a few weeks ago, reluctantly at first but with wins and losses for both parties genuine animosity had turned to friendly rivalry. It still felt surreal what was happening to Rustwreck but Downhaul had stopped fretting a while ago and simply decided to try and nudge the cult into the right direction.
