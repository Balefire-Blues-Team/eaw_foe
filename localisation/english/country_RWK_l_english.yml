rustwreck.1.t: "Rustwreck seeks to renew trade-ties"
rustwreck.1.d: "Earlier today, our halls of power received a visitor, a low ranking sailor called Crows Nest from Rustwreck, proposing we build up a trade route between Valkyrie’s Point and The Bend. Now Rustwreck isn’t exactly an economic powerhouse, but they’ve still got a lot of stuff, and caps, that we’d like to get our hooves on. Of course, The Ringers aren’t going to be very happy to hear we’re trading outside of ‘The Family’, might even see it as undermining their power.\n\nWhat’s undeniable is that this deal will help both of us and would provide a big economic boost. We could use that boost to try and jumpstart our economy, either to become a better partner to The Ringers, or to strike out on our own.

rustwreck.4.t: "The Scourge of the Sea"
rustwreck.4.d: "It’s a muggy and windy day in Rustwreck, as it always is. High Tides paced back and forth through his spacious office, glancing out the window every so often. A raider gang, pirates, more like, called the Razorsharks, have taken over an offshore mining rig, and much as he’d love to just shell them, that thing is just too valuable to damage or lose. Of course everypony has come up with their own ideas on how to solve this issue, from the more reasonable to the outright insane.\n\nWavebreaker put forward the most sane and normal proposal, requesting that our forces should simply engage the raiders at sea and on shore until we wear them down enough to force them to flee. Killing is what everyone else does to raiders, it’s what they deserve, it’s the most straight-forward path to victory. But of course, doing this would lose good sailors, ponies with families, jobs, dying against some monstrous scum of Equestria.\n\nDoctor Kelp, in all her doctorly confidence, has proposed a pacifistic solution. She’s treated some raiders we took captive before, talked to them, knows them, says they aren’t as scummy as we think, that if she could talk to them she could convince them to leave with some money. Not only does this require us to pay those freaks, but it puts our best Doctor at risk, and it just pushes the problem down the road. She seems confident, but overconfidence has killed many a so-called 'intellectual'.\n\nCrimson Waters rushed her proposal, written in red ink, well, hopefully that’s ink, never know with that psycho. Her proposal is to send her to a meeting and have her convince the raiders to join her cult. This would get rid of the raiders, and if it fails, Tartarus, it might get rid of her too, not the worst outcome. Worst outcome is she succeeds, then not only do we have more cultists, but cultists with experience. Whatever. A decision has to be made.."

Reports indicate VICTORY, as the RAZORSHARKS have been defeated with only minor losses to our side. The RAZORSHARKS have been hunted down and destroyed and are sure to never threaten our shores before. \n\nThe MINING RIG, ORICHALCHUM, has been taken over and scavenging teams have been hard at work scavenging through it and finding everything of value to RUSTWRECK and our glorious mission. Preliminary searches have reported valuable materials being found aboard ORICHALCUM, which is being inspected further by naval engineers. Further scavenging teams shall see what more hides. No major incidents reported, scavenging to continue."

rustwreck.6.d: "Reports have come in from Doctor Kelp, not done in the proper format expected of a report, but that’s what happens when a civilian like her writes. The raiders have left the Orichalcum, the name of the mining rig they inhabited, and not a single drop of blood was spilled. Of course, it cost us a pretty cap, but is money worth more than lives? Maybe. Especially since it looks like those pirate scum are heading north, to the Rain Riders’ territory, meaning we’ll have to keep a close eye on them.\n\nOf course Doctor Kelp has gotten praise from all around ever since she got back, ponies are happy their sons and husbands aren’t sailing out to fight pirates. Even those sceptical of her have kept their mouths shut, just watching the shores with slight worry. Of course she hasn’t let it get to her head, no, and that makes it all the worse, a quiet arrogance by not being arrogant about an achievement. If we end up seeing some of those pirates in a Rain Riders’ raid, gonna make sure that Kelp sees them, knows that her victory wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows."

rustwreck.7.d: "Feasts, they’ve been the gathering place of ponies since the beginning of history, where enemies can sit and break bread with each other, sort out their differences in a quiet, sophisticated manner. Yet here we stand amongst brothers, sisters, followers and lackeys and those few golden who question yet follow anyway, and the feast is so… sloppy. Slobbering Raiders, shouting and drinking without a care in the world, so loud. Crimson stands and watches as her many cult members talk with the new converts, including Stranglevine, the raider leader who’s fully bought into it all. He’s a fool who’s not taken a single second to think, merely following the first pony who offered a hoof. A mutt, and that’s being unkind to dogs. They shout and talk of the wonders of all the cult has to offer, but they’re nothing but snakes in the grass, to turn so easily was a sign of weakness, not a sign of strength.\n\nShe would saunter out from the door she stood behind, and like that the feast would become quiet, as all look over at her. She flicks her mane to the side, clearing her eyes to look at each and every one of them, before putting on a practised grin and happy expression, ‘My brothers and my sisters, my lovely ponies from every trot of life, I am so happy you’ve accepted your new siblings in faith so readily. Stranglevine here was so attentive when I told him everything about the Endtide, following my every word like a do.. Ahem, a loyal hound eager to learn from its master, the perfect member!’ Her words are met with a cheer, as she scoops up a drink, hopping up onto the table, scattering around plates of food, holding it up with a wide smirk, ‘To our new brothers and sisters, converts to the truth, to the wondrous world they’ve opened their eyes to, to me, who shared with them the truth so freely, so readily! My followers, my beloved ponies, my friends and my family, raise a glass, raise a mug, raise your voice, all together we welcome them! Bound by blood, we are one!"

Of course we’ve always been open to trade with them, they have a lot of stuff to give, but we’ve treated them no different than any other trader. This fleet though came with some documents, an agreement to offer us, saying we should lower our tariffs of them and be more open to their economies.\n\nNow there’s some benefits and drawbacks to both options. Saying yes will give us some better trade, a better economy, but then again, it might also open them up to getting better too. We don’t know if Rustwreck is going to be on our side forever, so giving them some economic opportunity might come back to bite our flanks in the future. Of course, if we say no, we’ll also lose out on that benefit. We have a lot to gain and a lot to potentially lose, we’ll have to think."

The Celestial Sea Fleet, rebuilt with the latest technology available after the disaster that happened in 1014, was dispatched on an interception mission to catch the stripes before they had a chance to get close to Equestria and her sacred shoreline. Passing by Albion, the Fleet was assisted by Northern Air Command, carrying dozens of Raptors, Skytanks, and a Thunderhead, who moved to assist the Fleet and her flagship, the Battleship HMS Sunrise.\n\nContact with the enemy was established near the Stepstone Sea, seeing the enemy fleet consisted of many smaller vessels, and a few larger ones such as the enemy flagship, the Gloriana. High Tides would act decisively upon spotting the enemy fleet, seeing the three options before him. He could hunt down the enemy’s flagship and destroy their spirits, as well as their command structure, he could destroy as many smaller vessels as possible to remove all extra firepower, or he could attack carefully as to conserve strength for future conflicts. Of all options, High Tides decided upon:"

rustwreck.11.t: "The Long Retreat"
rustwreck.11.d: "The Celestial Sea Fleet failed their mission...\n\nWe failed Equestria...\n\nWhere Equestrian lasers boiled the sea and melted hulls, the Zebras responded with salvoes of hundreds of missiles that minced flesh and steel in equal measure.\nWhere tactical Megaspells ripped holes in the Zebrican formation, they were answered by balefire torpedoes that vaporized Equestrian ships without even wreckage left behind.\nThe battle was even... we could have won.\nCould have won if Northern Air Command hadn't betrayed us. By some subtle signal our air support broke of the battle as one and ascended beyond the clouds. Radio transmissions urged every Pegasus in the fleet to retreat to the clouds as well, but the Admiral ordered that our own anti-aircraft guns be used to shoot every desserter out of the sky. Few dared to try and join their feathered brothers after that. Still, without air support the battle would be a one sided slaughter. The order to retreat was given and luckily the Imperial fleet was damaged enough to not pursue.\nJust as preparations had been made to rendevouz at Albion and repair, our systems went out of control. Warning sirens went off on every ship in the fleet, striking many an unlucky sailor deaf for days after.\n\nIt had finally happened!\nThe much dreaded megaspell exchange...the end of the world.\nMinutes later, the sirens manually disabled, sickly green explosions could be seen on the mainland as zebrican Balefire Warheads destroyed everything we once held dear. An hour off the coast High Tides watched several warheads impact around Albion, shrouding the whole metropolis in necromantic fallout. Where to now? Prance? Manehattan? Fillydelphia? No, every major city and known military installation would be targeted.\nWith his homeland dying mere miles away, Admiral High Tides charted a course for the little used harbour of Redheap on the Poninsula.\nThe world was over, but on their way south, they would save what they could..."

rustwreck.12.d: "Her Majesty’s Navy is still the gemstone of Equestria, even if half of it has washed up on the shore of the small town once called Redheap. Sailors have renamed it to Rustwreck out of some sort of humor about the ships crashed into shore, attempting to make light of the situation. While annoying on its own, what annoyed High Tides more than anything was when one of these jokesters tried to seriously convinced him to get rid of more of the fleet, due to ‘economic drain’ and ‘resource use’, nothing but excuses from Zebra-loving pansies who want to see the last shining light of Equestria snuffed out.\n\nSure, its been ten years since Equestria died, and High Tides looks more like a zombie than a pony at this point, but that navy is still more valuable than the opinion of a hooffull of sailors. But they have a point, the fleet won’t need to turn its guns against the striped menace for a while longer, and if Her Majesty’s Navy wants a chance to ever spill striped blood again, it’ll cost a sacrifice. So, biting his tongue and putting down his pride, High Tides would reluctantly agree to a proposition on what to do with the ships."

rustwreck.13.d: "HMS Iron Shield, once a great enforcer of Equestrian power, Luna’s long-reaching hoof, even if just a cruiser, has now become a derelict hive of scum and psychopathic freaks, otherwise known as the Cult of the Endtide. High Tides would be given a tour after a surprisingly cordial meeting with the Cult, though his bodyguards retain a quiet vigilance, you never know with cultists, after all. He made a show of correcting the cultist giving the tour at every point, after all, he knows damn well what a cruiser’s inside looks like and he doesn’t need some freak to explain it to him like he’s never seen it before. Each correction would make his guards tense slightly and prepare for lashback, but none would ever come, the cultist laughing it off and continuing the tour. Being laughed at only put High Tides in an even worse mood, and he had to suppress many, many violent feelings before the tour ended.\n\nNow stood in a meeting room, once a captain’s quarters, he met Crimson Waters, head freak, dressed in a disgusting robe with brown stains all over it, probably blood considering it’s this psycho. Her stance is terrible too, like one of those pansy Army generals who got in through birth, confident and theatrical, the type of pony he’d like to give a lashing if they ever got on his ship. Crimson surprised him, though, because as soon as everypony else left, she would begin to speak more normally, giving him an offer to end all the recent trouble.\n\nShe gave him a list, a list of names, fake troublemakers who Crimson wants to take the blame so she can deal with the actual perpetrators more subtly. Given she’s the leader of the freaks who caused the trouble to begin with, this offer first came off as extremely rude, arrogant even, and it took until Tides was shouting and growling at her that she fully explained. Do this for her, trust her, let her take care of it, and the cult will align with the state, calming tensions. Just take the list and blame them, let her do the work, and calm everything down.\n\nHigh Tides’ voice sounded more raspy than normal as he talked over the deal, a pounding in the back of his head telling him to just kill her for even thinking she can offer him this poisoned deal. But her cult is big, it could be helpful to have on his side, even if the freaks are psychos. Of course, she’s also giving him a list of ponies she doesn’t like, or is even scared of, it’d be easy to just go to them, make them work against her. As she flashed him a final, confident smirk, he’d be left to make the choice in a second of thought."

Those cult freaks, the Endtide, have been fighting hoof and tooth in Westshore and in the Poninsula, giving those freaks the exact fate they deserve, bullets to the skull so their psycho-babble doesn’t make any other freak follow them. These insane freaks, unlike those Zebras freaks, were easy to beat, scattered and disorganised, wiped up easier than a dead roach by a broom and pan. Those freaks didn’t even suspect we were coming, they hardly had weapons, made them easier to shoot than a pacifistic protest back in the good old days.\n\nSadly these freaks have been entrenched in a few places, strongholds with guns, ammo, and plenty of psychopathic freaks to use them. It will cost good ponies their lives, it will cost us bullets, but we’ll get it done. These freaks aren’t worth the bullets used to kill them, but as long as they try and destabilise us, they’re a threat worth killing. Soon there are going to be some proper assaults on those freaks, and once we’re done, well, Crimson Waters is gonna be surrounded by a bunch of ponies losing their crimson."

Wavebreaker, that geek, planned the attack, though like all geeks he stayed out of it when the going actually came, letting others handle it. Pansy. Doctor Kelp and her ‘Council’ gave us some caps and the infrastructure to rebuild it all, though that pacifistic high-on-her-pony Kelp is going to rub it in our nose for the rest of time by never actually acknowledging it. Not like that Manehattenite pacifist could ever handle actually going out there to fight, nah, she’d turn to the bottle like the rest of her kind always do when the going gets tough.\n\nEven though they’re both pansies, they’re helping, so they’ve had some say in stuff, like renaming the town. Wavebreaker actually gave a good idea when he got his face out of one of them geek novels, said we should name the town after a pony who was in the first wave, a hero who died fighting. Probably because the geek feels guilty about not being there. Kelp wants to restore the old name of the town, which isn’t bad either, it’s about time some normal names came back to Equestria, enough of this ‘Rain Riders’ and ‘Liberation Army’ and whatever in Tartarus’s name those traitors are naming their fiftieth cloud city or bunker. Both ponies have got good points, but only one can be picked."

rustwreck.16.t: "The Fate of Crimson Waters"
rustwreck.16.d: "In a brig would be one pony, desperate and defeated, Crimson Waters, looking up at Wavebreaker, High Tides, and Doctor Kelp, as they look back at her. Before they could say a word, she would speak, quickly and without that trademark cult personality, ‘You don’t want to kill me! Celestia’s name, do you actually think I believed all that cult stuff? I’m the one who made it up, me, made it up out of thin air, I’m not a believer, I’m just a mare who wanted power, okay, just a normal mare who’s plan got out of hoof! I went too far, okay, I know, I shouldn’t have gone against you, but look at all I’ve done, look at everything-‘\n\nShe’s cut off by a rising growl from High Tides, who presses against the cage door separating them, speaking in a very raspy voice, ‘I should throw you overboard until you wither and die like the insect psychopathic freak you are!’ Wavebreaker would nod along, looking at her, ‘Sir, with all due respect, I agree, she’s done a lot wrong. A pony with the power to speak like her is a threat, sir, one which shouldn’t be underestimated. She is like a Sirin, sir, it’s best we not give her time to sing.’ High Tides looks over at him, deadpan, ‘Is that a reference to one of your geek stories?’ Wavebreaker blinks and shakes his head too quickly, ‘No! No sir! I don’t even know what you’re talking about, sir, geek stories have nothing to do with what I do in my free time, sir, nor what I do on shore leave, sir, and respectfully, sir, there is no connection between me and it, sir, it is more disconnected than a flamethrower and a 155mm gun, sir.’\n\nDoctor Kelp steps forward, ‘If I may, Wavebreaker, that is quite enough of your obscuration. High Tides, I believe that Crimson Waters should be given amnesty rather than defenestrated, I believe it is pertinent to consider the possibility of beneficial consequences of keeping her around.’ High Tides opens his mouth to speak, but Kelp talks before he can, ‘Like her or call her a psychopath, though narcissistic personality disorder would be more accurate if we’re psychologically diagnosing her, you must acquiesce and admit she has done something impressive. She built a rival power system within your nation-state, one whose prominence threatened your reign, one which could have easily overthrown you given time. That power is not to be thrown away, it would be like a unicorn throwing away telekinesis, rather that dangerous power should be used, abused, to your advantage.’ High Tides would frown, but relent."

Cults, though, are infuriating, claiming they have the answers to every problem, just throwing gasoline onto the problems that already exist. Before the war it was Nightmare Cultists, bats and freaks who wanted that psycho, Nightmare Moon, to return, during the war it was those zebra kooks who didn't know flank from tail, shouting their babble about stars. Nowadays , it’s the Cult of the Endtide, freaks that are just as bad as those before then, but now they serve a purpose due to that uneasy alliance.\n\nTheir preachers have been getting more bold recently, preaching their nonsense right outside of the capital, and some ponies were even buying into their psycho cult preachings. If we let them continue like this then more ponies are going to become freaks like them, kooks spouting about doomsday and apocalypse like we haven’t already gone through one, but it’ll keep them happy and on our side. Of course, we could also crack down, throw these freaks into a cell, spare our ponies from their nonsense, but that would make Crimson mad. What’s more valuable, tossing these freaks where they belong, or keeping Crimson happy?"

Oh sure, there were raiders, psychopaths, cultist freaks fighting each other, but those were never wars, not on the same scale. Not like the war High Tides had seen before. But the world has changed recently, a silver-tongued psychopath has taken Fillydelphia, Ranger-freaks are coming out of their bunkers, those freaky alicorns are making moves, not to mention the radio doesn’t shut up about heroes this and heroes that, it’s obvious that things are coming to a boiling point.\n\nHigh Tides stands in his office, overlooking the capital, feeling a lowly simmering pride deep in his chest, seeing how far this place has come. Ponies trot safely, no raider freaks are around, no pinko pacifists haunt the streets, it’s like a slice of the old world if everything was more decayed. But it can come so much further, with slow, stable growth in the civilian sector it could be so much more, a maretropolis, a shining star on the coast, a screw you to those zebras for thinking they could destroy it. But there’s tensions, there’s gonna be war soon, and even the best discipline doesn’t beat a foe if they don’t have ammo to shoot with. Thus he stands, looking out, pondering, is it best to focus on defence and war, so they’ll never be caught off guard, or focus on building up the civilian sector and making everything better?"

You did a good job with it, Officer. . .’ He trails off, looking the Officer in the eyes for a few moments, before speaking slowly, ‘Sea Cucumber, of course.

It’s not like you to forget words like this, sir, especially not of ships.’ High Tides raises a hoof and points onwards, indicating the tour should go on. Sea Cucumber would blink, but slowly go along, stepping into the ship to give a tour of its refurbished insides. High Tides would follow after, until a sudden bout of dizziness, making him stumble and slam his head into the metal door leading into the ship. He growls while Sea Cucumber comes up to him, ‘Sir, are you okay? That was a bad hit, sir.’\n\nHigh Tides growls and clutches his head, stumbling a bit, before shaking his head, ‘I’m fine.’ He waves at the Officer dismissively, ‘The ship looks good enough, the Haste, Grace, whatever, it’s good to sail. This is a waste of my time, I’m going home.’ He growls out the last word and storms away, his hooves hitting hard against the ground as he trots, putting his mind onto other matters."

We don’t know what has infected you, and if this pathogen has a high infection risk then it could cause havoc amongst us all.’ He looks at her and opens his mouth to speak, but in a surprising show of force, she stomps her hoof, “Tides. You will listen to your doctor and you will listen now. I am stumped by what’s causing you to be sick and I need time to research it, to find out what this could be, ghouls don’t usually catch pathogens, so this is unique. There’s no room for further questioning, you will listen and obey, and you will remain in your bed.’ She looks deep into his eyes, before spinning around, trotting out of there.\n\nWavebreaker enters as soon as she leaves, giving Tides a salute and a slightly worried look. Tides looks at him and closes his eyes, ‘Wavebreaker. I hope you didn’t have any plans for that geek stuff for the next week, I need you to take over. Damned pinko Doctor ordered me to remain in my bed and I know better than to piss off your medical staff. You’ll be taking care of things for me, understood.’ Wavebreaker nods, ‘Yes sir, though I should note I did not plan to do anything that involved geekiness for the next week, or the next rest of my life, sir. Are you okay, sir?’ High Tides would lean back and growl, ‘I’ll be better when I don’t have to put up with annoying nerds and geeks coming into my room! Get out already!’ Wavebreaker salutes and follows orders, leaving the room immediately."
rustwreck.24.a: "A sick ghoul? Scary."

rustwreck.25.t: "Diagnosis"
rustwreck.25.d: "Throbbing pain and weakness for a week, unending and unforgiving, High Tides would know no respite. Doctor Kelp worked hard on a diagnosis, taking tests and running theories, annoying him almost every single day, her pacifistic smart-pony arrogance almost driving him to madness multiple times. Today would be no different, coming in to take useless samples to run her useless tests on them, all while treating him like he’s some infirm corpse!\n\nDoctor Kelp stands at the hoof of Tides’ bed, speaking to him, ‘Admiral, despite being alive, your body is still, for all intents and purposes, a cadaver slowly rotting away due to necrosis. Your external self looks fine, as fine as a ghoul can look, but inside, Admiral, your body has been withering.’ She lifts up a flask to her lips, taking a deep sip of warming whiskey, before putting it down, speaking slowly, ‘It’s reached your brain now, Admiral, that’s the cause of the migraines you feel, it’s your brain slowly rotting. Soon it’ll be gone and you’ll become feral, Admiral, you’ll be. . . You’ll be gone. I don’t know what I can do, I’ve run tests and tried to make cures and vaccinations, but nothing works. I’ll try. I’ll try, Tides. I’m sorry.’\n\nTides looks at her as he’s given the news, the throbbing pain getting worse, filling his head with nothing except that pain. A moment passes before he stands from his bed, his legs wobbling as he approaches her, a growl rising in his throat, ‘You’re telling me I’m going to die, Doctor Kelp? Then what are you good for if you can’t do anything about it?’ He scowls and gets right in front of her face, ensuring she can smell his rotting breath, ‘You think you know everything you pinko pacifistic little good for nothing rich pony? Think you know I’m going to die? You think you know? You know nothing about death!’ He pushes her back and shouts louder, ‘Leave! Get out of my sight you useless idiot! I should have never hired you to begin with, you’ve done nothing for me, nothing, nothing!’ She frowns softly and extends a hoof towards him, ‘Tides-‘ He shouts over her in a loud yell, slamming his hoof against a nearby wall, putting a dent into it, growling, ‘You keep your mouth shut about this or I’m going to make sure you never say another useless word again! Now get out!’\n\nIt was only after she left that he paused, breathed, and began to slowly cry."
rustwreck.25.a: "We need to keep this secret"

rustwreck.26.t: "Pain"
rustwreck.26.d: "Bright lights, restraints, the smell of a sterile hospital, those all met Admiral High Tides as he opened his eyes. A mare stands above him, a doctor, probably a field medic who’s pulled him away from his ship going down. Heh, bet he gave it to the stripes before that ship went down. He’s only a Ensign at this point, but he’ll be damned before he gives the stripes a win without some blood.\n\nTides speaks, his voice a bit more raspy than he remembers, ‘Hey there, Doc. How’s the stripe look?’ The mare looks down at him, a name-tag on her, reading Doctor Kelp. Strange, no rank. She speaks softly, ‘Admiral Tides?’ He snorts with a quick laugh, ‘I wish, just Ensign right now, sweetheart. What happened to me out there? Did I take down one of the stripes?’ She frowns, and takes a second before responding, ‘Tides, I’m afraid you’re not in the past. You are Admiral High Tides, leader of Rustwreck, the war was two hundred years ago. You were turned into a ghoul via Balefire bombs, and you’ve been demonstrating retrograde amnesia due to a process called feralization, where you slowly lose yourself. We’re trying our best to save you.’ He takes a second to take in all she said, before cracking a small grin, ‘Dang, and here I was hoping I was a young sailor being cared after by a cute doctor. I-‘ He growls as a lance of pain goes through his head, ‘I remember the pain, and the biting, I’m dying, I’m. . . Oh Celestia, I’m really dying, it hurts so much.’\n\nKelp looks away from the bed, taking out a flask and taking a deep swig from it, before looking back, ‘Tides. I. I have made a cure for the process, one which can halt it. But. It’s not pleasant. It’ll be the worst pain you’ve ever felt, assuming it even works. You’ll hopefully remember everything and be able to increase your lifespan again. But I can’t promise anything. I’m sorry, I tried my best.’ He chuckles softly, closing his eyes, ‘Hey, I don’t want a pretty mare crying being the last thing I see, Kelp. It hurts a lot, more than anything I’ve felt before, but I’m a soldier, I can maybe take it. But I don’t know. Maybe I should just die, let it all end.’ He sighs out, and looks up at her, answering after a minute."
rustwreck.26.a: "Do it!"
rustwreck.26.b: "Just let me die..."

rustwreck.27.t: "The Treatment"
rustwreck.27.d: "The screams are the only thing Kelp hears. She attempts to drown them out with her flask, but it doesn’t work, they echo around her mind like a bad case of tinnitus. It was supposed to work, every test said that it should, the pain wasn’t supposed to be that bad. Another swig. High Tides was a grumpy stallion, hardly nice, but he was a good stallion, a stallion who deserved so much more. Another swig. She should have seen the signs, should have prepared a cure before, maybe he’d still be awake. Another swig, but nothing comes, the flask run dry. His body is there in the room, catatonic.\n\nThe nurses and her had injected him with the cure before retreating, watching with baited breath as he spasmed, screamed, and begged for the pain to be over. His mother, Celestia, Luna, even Discord, he begged them all, before it all went silent. She approached him with bated breath and hope, reaching out for a response, but none came. The others checked him, a burst blood vessel during the struggle, he’s still alive, but never to awake again. It wouldn’t even occur to her. She’d sit next to him, holding his rotting hoof, hoping they’re wrong, hoping he’d awake. He never did. No matter how much she begged he would, no matter how much she prayed, he never woke up.\n\nShe’s drunk off of her whiskey, but it doesn’t help. Every time she closes her eyes she sees him make the decision, looking so hopeful and so afraid. She trots over to him and takes his hoof, holding it for a minute, before she whispers to him, ‘I’m sorry, Tides. I tried my best. I’m sorry.’ She sniffles as her eyes water, turning away from Admiral High Tides for the last time."
rustwreck.27.a: "Damn, this is gonna be a problem"

rustwreck.28.t: "Emergency Powers"
rustwreck.28.d: "Early yesterday a treatment to cure the process of becoming a feral ghoul was given to High Tides, but during the treatment he suffered a burst blood vessel, and has since gone catatonic.’ Doctor Kelp speaks, sitting at a table with many well dressed ponies, members of the Sunrise Development Council, some military ponies, more peaceful members of the New Admiralty, and some not well dressed ones, the supporters of Jacques Perrylous, and the Griffon himself. She continues, a half-empty glass of whiskey on the table in front of her, ‘Wavebreaker and Crimson Waters are sure to try and grasp for power, which will bring Rustwreck into an era of conflict and war, if they don’t tear apart the realm fighting for leadership. In light of this, I propose I be granted temporary emergency powers so I can steer our nation through this crisis.’\n\nMurmurs break out amongst the table, even the most loyal to Kelp being hesitant to agree, but the murmurs die down as Jacques stands, tapping his talons against the table, ‘So let me see if I’ve got this right, Miss Kelp. Your failure has basically killed High Tides, and you want us to trust you with emergency powers?’ He snorts, ‘I ain’t a chick, and I wasn’t born yesterday, we can all see this is a grab at power for yourself. Couldn’t take being First Mate so you had to become Captain did you? Who’s to say you ain’t just gonna call everything an emergency, eh, who’s to say you ain’t gonna be a dictator?’ He grins slightly, ‘Why should my crew not just leave right now?’\n\nShe looks at him, sitting down and picking up her whiskey, taking a deep sip, before setting it down, ‘Jacques Perrylous, I require your presence because I trust you to do what needs to be done. I’m a Doctor, I swore to do no harm when I took my oath, believe me, the ivory towers of power are not my place. But Wavebreaker is hawkish, Crimson is insane, and you don’t have enough support to win leadership, I am the only mare educated enough to take the reins. I also need your help and experience, Jacques. You’ve been sailing a sinking ship for twenty years.’ She picks up her whiskey, and downs the last of it, then sliding her papers to the centre of the table, the paper being a proposal for emergency powers, ‘Welcome to my sinking ship."
rustwreck.28.a: "Let's hope none try for a coup"

rustwreck.29.t: "The Compromise"
rustwreck.29.d: "Ponies and a few Griffons stand armed all throughout Rustwreck, the Royal Marines and some sailors occupying the harbour for Wavebreaker, while some militia, parts of the army, and Jacques’ crew stand opposed from them, each side itching for a sign to draw their guns and fire. Above it all, in the Harbourmaster’s Office, stand Kelp and Wavebreaker, drinking whiskey and coffee respectively. Bags line the bottom of their eyes, both having only gotten sleep in winks and blinks the past few days. Paper lays on the table between them, terms of agreement between the two sides.\n\nWavebreaker paces back and fourth, looking out the window to the stand-off below, while speaking in a high-strung voice, ‘Why did this have to happen? It was all going so well, Tides seemed to be doing better, to just die like he did, it’s not right. It’s not right at all.’ He looks at Kelp with narrowed eyes, ‘And his killer is the one telling me I should just give up and let her lead? Your failure caused him to die, Kelp, and even worse it caused him to die in pain, in suffering, horribly. It’s not just murder you did, it’s torture, and now I’m expected to sign the country to you? You know I could send the marines in, they would likely win.’\n\nDoctor Kelp sighs softly and picks up her whiskey glass, downing another portion of it, before putting it down, ‘It was supposed to cure him, not kill him, and he is still alive, even if catatonic. I won’t make excuses for my failures, my mistakes have been numerous and often, that is not the problem at hoof.’ She taps the paper in front of her, ‘Wavebreaker, you’ll be the new Admiral, even if the country won’t belong to you. You will command the navy and be at its helm, you’ll be able to keep me in check, checks and balances, Wavebreaker. You could order your soldiers forward and you might win, but you would leave us weak and crippled, paving the way for the Ringers to conquer us. I know you aren’t happy about it. I’m not happy about it either, if I could give away this responsibility, I would. But Rustwreck comes first.’ Wavebreaker picks up his own coffee, downing it as he closes his eyes. Slowly, he opens them back up, and signs his name on the paper."
rustwreck.29.a: "Crisis averted."

rustwreck.30.t: "Separation of Church and State"
rustwreck.30.d: "Earlier this week, I spoke to Admiral Wavebreaker, and convinced him along with the New Admiralty to join our side. While averting civil war from the New Admiralty, Crimson Waters and the Cult of the Endtide have seized many outlying settlements for their cause, ensuring any conflict would be a bloodbath. Thus, I have invited to the Council today the mare herself, Crimson Waters.’ Doctor Kelp would finish her droll speech as the doors swing open, Crimson Waters sauntering into the room, a group of bodyguards following right behind her. Her each step is purposeful and confident, her eyes scanning every set at the table. Doctor Kelp continues her speech, ‘In order to find alliance and compromise with the Cult of Endtimes, we will be voting on a bill to give them representation, should Crimson agree.’\n\nCrimson flicks her mane through the air and grins as Kelp finishes speaking, ‘My oh my, are you all sure you haven’t picked a robot as your leader? Such lifeless prose, and such a stiff pose, I’ve heard more life from Spite-Bots.’ She chuckles, her cultists chuckling along, as she begins to trot around the table, behind the backs of the council members, ‘But even a broken bot is right twice a day, oh yes indeed, she is right to not want to fight me. None of you have seen a second of war nor a drop of blood, you’re virgins to destruction, afraid to ever face the flames stoked outside. You’re going to be angry when I have my seat alongside you, you’ll think I’m a freak, like the late corpse.’ She leans her head in to the table, placing it right on the shoulder of the sitting Jacques, who looks over at her as she grins, ‘I think I want my seat right beside this one, oh yes, that’ll be nice. I accept your terms, Kelp, after all, bound by blood, we are one.’\n\nThe council would all be uncomfortable in the minutes following, but, with a resounding yes vote, the bill would pass, granting the Cult of the Endtide many privileges."
rustwreck.30.a: "Freedom, even for the Cultists."

rustwreck.31.t: "Blood or Steel?"
rustwreck.31.d: "It’s hard to remember things. High Tides doesn’t remember what day it is. What year. Sometimes he thinks Celestia is still alive, he can swear he sees Luna. Other times he wants nothing more than to rip out some stripes’ throat. It’s too much. He’s dying, that’s clear to see, he can’t even summon the energy to care about that anymore. But Rustwreck needs a leader, no matter if they’re a geek, or a freak. Just. Someone. Someone after him.\n\nWavebreaker stands above High Tides in his bed, and though the stallion tries to look stoic and professional, he can’t stop his eyes from looking worried, scared, and sad. The two would talk for hours, from the early morning to the mid afternoon, after all, Tides can’t do anything else. Wavebreaker is a good stallion, he hates the cowardly Pegasi and the cowardly MWT just as much as Tides, he won’t let them trot all over Rustwreck, no, he’ll use the navy to blast them out of the sky and bunker. He sees Wastelanders as tools, assets to be given orders and told what to do, he’s pragmatic, practical, he’ll lead them well. Better than that, he’s practically lived his whole life on a boat, he’ll be able to order the military like nobody else, making Rustwreck worth respecting. He’s a nerd, and a geek, and his glasses are stupid, but that doesn’t matter. Not now. Now anymore. Wavebreaker would leave after a long time, his eyes sad as he said his final goodbyes.\n\nCrimson would spend the rest of the day talking to Tides, the mare’s every word being confident, even if they’re mostly insane. Her eyes shine with intelligence and charisma as she speaks, and with some care for Tides, even if they don’t see eye to eye on everything. She’s insane, of course, a psychopathic freak leading a cult who’s even worse, blood drinkers and killers. But she’s the leader of a cult so disliked, yet somehow it’s gained so much popularity. The cult is also treated well by her, and no matter what one can say, she will listen when someone speaks. Above all, she’s charismatic, and maybe that’s what Rustwreck needs, someone who can lead them, unify them. She would leave as the night begins, using her last words with Tides to wish him good luck on the other side.\n\nBoth candidates have their upsides and downsides. With his mind slowly slipping, Tides calls his staff into the room, before declaring his official successor."

rustwreck.32.t: "The Prodigal Son"
rustwreck.32.d: "Twenty years ago, we sent an expedition to Griffonia to try and see if any life remained that could potentially be used to our benefit, but it never returned and was thought to have been dead. Commodore Seafoam left and never returned, until now, when we spotted a large and dilapidated barge slowly sailing its way to Rustwreck. Being hailed on the radio, they confirmed they were the Stableside, the very same barge that was thought to have been gone. They were allowed closer, and upon seeing them, it was discovered that they weren’t lying. Some of the old sailors matched descriptions for the same crew we sent twenty years ago, matched them exactly.\n\nAs our ships neared, we were able to identify the captain, who spoke to us over radio, a Griffon who claims to be the adopted son of the Commodore we sent out. His name is Jacques Perrylous, a Griffon blue in color, with an eye patch over one eye and a wooden peg replacing one of his legs. Most of the crew was in some bad state, he was no different, dirty and looking slimmer than average, it seems like they’ve gone through Tartarus to get back home. Our ships have begun to escort them back to the shore, with many curious of the tale these travellers have to tell, and excited for the experience they can bring."
rustwreck.32.a: "This is quite unusual"

rustwreck.33.t: "Time claims us all"
rustwreck.33.d: "It was all calm before High Tides finally went feral, ponies seemed like for once they could agree to something, mourning the oncoming loss of their leader. The moment was also calm, and sombre, with Doctor Kelp ordering a merciful death via drugs to the feral Admiral, and a day spent all across the nation to mourn, to celebrate the life and soon to come legacy of Admiral High Tides, may he rest in peace. The days after, however, tensions began to rise again in every town and city, arguments and little fights becoming all the more common, everyone knows the time is approaching where Rustwreck’s fate will be decided.\n\nWhispered in the alleyways and spoke in hushed tones in safe-houses and barracks, the vultures, Crimson Waters and Wavebreaker, preparing for when the time comes. The Cult of the Endtide and the New Admiralty gather their supporters and prepare them, taking up arms, drawing out plans, using every last favor they have across the nation. It’s all done in the shadows for now, hidden from sight, but soon the time will come, and the nation will be able to do nothing but watch as its fate is secured."
rustwreck.33.a: "May he rest in peace"

rustwreck.34.t: "Succession"
rustwreck.34.d: "Anxiety isn’t an emotion Crimson Waters feels very often, suppressing it oftentimes in favor of her exuberant confidence and charm. Today is different for her, today is the day where everything needs to go right for her, or else all shall go wrong. Despite herself, her hooves tap nervously against the ground as she paces back and forward in a private room, her mind playing fifty different ways everything could go wrong, and a hundred more for it to go well.\n\nThe door opens, she looks hopefully as a cultist gives her a nod, slowly breaking out into a wide smile as the cultist gives the news. Wavebreaker was caught completely off guard, his soldiers and troops surrounded before they even woke up, and the stallion himself placed under house arrest. The only conflict was during the taking of the old admiralty building, where five guards and two cultists lost their lives in the fighting. Nobody stands against her now, the Cult has won.\n\nAs the messenger leaves, the anxiety comes back, chased by a wave of relief. Crimson has won, but these upcoming days will be where victory is truly secured, where she will show the nation every plan she has. Of course, ponies will be expecting a speech, the blind sheep of Rustwreck seeking a charismatic voice through these times, not caring what is said, but how. Luckily for them, Crimson is a wonderfully charismatic speaker. Suppressing all her anxiety and wearing a practised grin, she struts out of her room, ready to lead her new nation."
rustwreck.34.a: "Tide have mercy on us!"

rustwreck.35.t: "Succession"
rustwreck.35.d: "Joy is something Wavebreaker doesn’t feel very much, outside of the pages of a good book. Today, however, joy is exactly what he feels, filling up his heart and his head as he looks over Rustwreck from on high. There was no fight, no grand struggle for what’s right, because Rustwreck isn’t a novel, it’s a nation, filled with ponies thirsting for stability and for what’s right, in other words, him. Nobody would know that the Old Admiralty is out of their positions, fewer would care, but all will know when he begins to improve the nation for all of them. No longer is the Admiralty split between old and new, from today onwards, Rustwreck’s Admiralty stand unified.\n\nThe passing of Admiral High Tides, rest his soul, was an unfortunate day for everyone, and will be forever remembered as a day of mourning. But eventually, after a few years, a bit of joy will come after that, as ponies celebrate the opportunity that his passing has given them. Leading is much like a battle at sea, it’s all about seizing on an opportunity and making the most of it. Wavebreaker plans to do just that."
rustwreck.35.a: "New and Old as one."

rustwreck.36.t: "Some may die..."
rustwreck.36.d: "It’s a cold morning in Rustwreck, as deep within High Tides’ old office sit Doctor Kelp, currently drowning herself in wartime whiskey, and Crimson Waves, flipping through a list of ponies provided by Kelp, ponies who need to die. Crimson looks over at Kelp, setting aside that list and flipping through another folder of officers, ‘You know, Kelp, Loyalty was always my favorite Element of Harmony. I enjoy those who are loyal, like you, you’re loyal to your principles above all else, just like I am as well. In fact, the whole ‘bound by blood, we are one’, that’s just loyalty in a phrase, one in purpose, in following, so on. So I’m sure you understand why these ponies have to go, they aren’t loyal, they’re, how to say, disharmonious, chaotic. And like with the Nightmare and Discord, what is disharmonious is dangerous, and is gotten rid of.’\n\nKelp snorts softly and drinks down another glass of whiskey, setting it down too hard as she looks over at Crimson, ‘Don’t try to justify this purge to me, Crimson. You have your names, your list, leave me out of the rest of it. I’m a Doctor. I do no harm. Just, just get on with it, and leave me alone.’\n\nCrimson grins softly, opting for no response, instead turning back to the new files she has. Officers and Admirals, of course they can’t be taken care of right now, they have enough guns to flatten the whole country. But eventually, some will need to be gotten rid of. So, listening to the sounds of drinking and depression coming from Kelp, Crimson would mark them all, live, die, or dismissed."

NOTE: Somepony burned the templates used for the previous reports under the Admiral, so we’re doing it freestyle.\n\nIn the holy efforts to convert the Admitality away from their heretical ways to the pure and righteous manners of The Endtide, we have come across some stubborn admirals. Today, in the midst of trying to convince a Captain, of the HMS Valient, our agent fucked up big time and somehow made the Captain open fire on the capital. Luckily there was little damage from the bombardment due to the late hour, but this was still extremely bad. Crimson, in all her blessed wisdom, would summon a squad with a mage to take out the Captain, for the good of us all.\n\nUpon teleporting onto the ship, most would surrender, except the Captain and some of the higher ranks, who had to be eliminated. Good enough end, really, bastard already opened fire on his own capital, couldn’t be trusted. Due to this, the ship will no longer cause us any issues, and at least the other Captains know we aren’t messing around."

rustwreck.38.d: "Kaboom, say goodbye to your Flash Magnus Mark Three Anti Infantry Mechanised Pony!’ Dice clatter across the floor, surrounded by hundreds of plastic soldier ponies scattered all over the room, while Crimson and Wavebreaker stand over it. The game had a name once, but it’s been lost to time, now it’s just the game that these two play. It had started out as a joke by Doctor Kelp that they play it after an argument, but then they listened, they won, they lost, and slowly hate turned into a more friendly rivalry. The Doctor herself is the only one who knows the rules, but as she drinks her third glass, she can barely speak, let alone explain rules. The only other one in the room being Downhaul, the stallion wanting to see what all the fuss is about.\n\nWavebreaker shakes his head as Crimson pushes over an oversized plastic mech, ‘You rolled three sixes but the Flash Magnus Mark Three Anti Infantry Mechanised Pony has twenty hit points, therefore it still survives with two left and does not die. Therefore you do not win in this exchange, and I still have my Flash Magnus Mark Three Anti Infantry Mechanised Pony.’ Crimson shakes her head back, as the two then look to Kelp for answers. None come, as the Doctor has fully passed out, leaving the two rivals to look at each other. As one, they nod, holding up their hooves as Wavebreaker speaks, ‘We settle this honourably. Hoof, stone, parchment.’ Crimson nods solemnly as the two begin their conflict of hooves."

This would help make Rustwreck proper into an unbreakable fortress of steel, an industrial centre second, or perhaps even greater than, Fillydephia itself. Proposals range from mass large-scale redistribution from the new lands to more small-scale.\n\nThe only opposition comes from Doctor Kelp and some of her economists. They argue against Crimson Waters, holy be her name, that this redistribution is near equal to a cultural genocide of the newly conquered areas. The only appealing argument from their side was to point out that this centralization of industry and population makes the nation more vulnerable to attack. Should an enemy somehow take the capital, it would remove the majority of industry and population. They argue that keeping ponies and industry spread out would ensure that we can continue to fight on even should the capital fall. At the end of it all, a vote was held to see which proposal wins out."

Oh, I’m Red Ink, by the way, I’m supposed to be keeping records of this meeting, but right now we’re just sitting around doing nothing. Oh, here comes Scarlet, a high priest of the Cult, love her, she’s wearing a very nice outfit today, really matches her smile, oh shit she’s talking, umm, okay, got the basics. So basically Scarlet wants to name the Warcamp to Fort Crimson, since Crimson is so good.\n\nUgh, Doctor Kelp, she comes up next and gives some long speech about nothing, using those fancy words she likes. Basically she wants to name it Fort Aestus, which is old ponish for ‘tide’. Sounds like a nerd suggestion to me, I really hope we don’t actually go with that. Wavebreaker is up next, wants to name it Fort Hightide, makes sense since that stallion probably sees High Tides like a father after so long spent with him. And now everyone is debating, cool. Hey, just want to say, whoever wrote the reports for High Tides, I respect you, this shit is so annoying, I don’t know how you did it. Oh, shit, okay, the decision is being made.

He’s a merchant from Tenpony Tower, and he’s spent the last ten minutes arguing with a merchant over some blood bags, wanting to purchase with caps instead of scrip. Said merchant slams their hoof into the counter as they speak, ‘I have perfectly good caps that would be accepted anywhere else in the Wasteland, that scrip won’t be, so just take the caps already!’ The official selling the bags would motion to a currency exchange counter nearby, ‘I don’t make the rules, buddy, you want these blood bags, you need to get some scrip from right there. Don’t like it, go somewhere else.’\n\nThe merchant frowns in frustration before stomping their way over to the counter, only to discover that the counter works with certain amounts. One can’t give one hundred and twenty two caps to exchange, no, one can only give over two hundred plus thirty, as the system works in intervals of ten. It takes another few minutes of arguing before the merchant grumbles and pays the caps, being given the scrip.\n\nTrudging back to the official, the merchant would place down the scrip they have, getting all the blood bags possible. However, once all is said and done, they’d be left with eight extra scrip, the merchant looking at it, ‘What am I supposed to do with this? It’s worthless anywhere else!’ The official shrugs and grins, ‘Sorry, buddy, unless you want to buy something else, nothing else I can do to help.’\n\nThe Sunrise Shipping HQ’s pleasant day would be interrupted by a frustrated, angry shout."

rustwreck.42.d: "Report on lateness of boat that was late to returning to port.\n\nHey there boss, here’s that report you requested on that late boat, should hopefully be better than those boring reports that High Tides got. So, basically, yeah, like, so, our boat made a raid in the southeast and stopped in Baltimare on the way back home, restocking on supplies to feed the slaves they captured. So basically the Captain of one of the ships stopped there, since there were actually multiple ships, got real friendly-like with one of the higher ups of the crime families in Baltimare. The boats all stayed longer enjoying a little celebration by that higher up, along with the giant amounts of chems sold for cheap and everything else there.\n\nAnyway, their visit ended with an exchange of stuff and a friendly goodbye, meaning that Baltimare actually kinda likes us now. So, like, yeah, that’s probably good, might be something for you to take advantage of, boss. Anyway, that’s all for the report, this is Port Master signing off, peace out."

rustwreck.43.d: "After our recent economic restructuring, there’s been a lot of resources, money, and such left over waiting to be spent. Money serves no good collecting dust, and so ideas have been created to decide what to do with it. Some advisors advocate for spending the caps abroad because that will give other places the illusion of Rustwreck having a functioning economy. Apparently ponies really like to put caps into functioning places instead of non-functioning, so spending these caps could result in foreign ponies investing back into us and our industry.\n\nAnother advisor stumbled across some random blue unicorn stallion who’s selling some schematics and blueprints he apparently stole from somewhere in Manehatten. The prices are super high for just some simple blueprints, but at the same time, innovation is what brings strength, at least that’s what the unicorn said in his sales pitch. He seems like a bit of a little shit and even bragged about some weapons deal down south when he was talking to us. But he’s not wrong, these blueprints could be what makes us a force in the world.\n\nFinally, most simply, is to buy food and construct some houses for our ponies. As famous political theorist from before the war, Meow, said, a nation marches on its stomach. Or something like that. That might have actually been a Prench philosopher. Then again they’re Prench so they don’t matter. Despite the questionable origins of this quote, it’s not wrong, feeding the ponies and giving them houses will make them happier. Happier ponies means a happier realm. In the end, we have to decide on one idea."

I must say, I admire your Stable and your ponies, their manners, their ways, and how they border my country. It’s all so very nice, one of the pinnacles of Wasteland civilization, one might say. It would be such a shame to see it be ruined, as I’m sure you agree. I was hemming and hawing over this whole predicament of the stability and safety of your Stable all night last night, you see, and I came to a brilliant solution. I will offer my protection to your ponies!\n\nI’m sure you must be smiling quite widely at that most wondrous of news, after all, my soldiers are much more numerous, better armed, and better trained than your own quaint army. Your Stable will now have a proper force to protect it, to protect you, and all the ponies inside. My army will be making their way to the Stable as we speak, and oh, I do so hope that you welcome them with forelegs spread wide, it would, oh, it would just make my day. I look forward to a fruitful partnership with you, do try not to ruin it by any sort of needless protesting against our presence.\n\nSigned Crimson Waters, your new friend."

Umm, this is my first time writing a report, though, so please be nice. Okay? Cool. You’re cool for that. You’re the nicest leader. Sorry, right, I should actually say what happened. Okay, so, you sent a letter to the Stable, right, and it was, you know, really well written, I’m sure. But the Stable ponies basically said no, right, and they’re going to try and resist us taking them over.\n\nSo yeah anyway, it’s, it’s not the best situation, right, but, you know, they’re weak, and we’re going to be able to take them over without any issue. I hope we don’t have to kill too many of them, I’d like to see what a pony looks like not covered in dirt or blood. I’m sure you would too. I mean, you know, the stallions of the cult, they’re always so dirty, unlike the Stable ponies, their fur is always so clean. Probably smells nice, and not like blood and fish.

rustwreck.46.d: "It’s a slightly cold day in the Wasteland, clouds covering the sky, as the forces of Rustwreck arrive at the entrance of what was once the capital of Stajniopolis. Stable ponies stand around outside it, watching as the soldiers approach, covered in sea-spray, a bit of blood, and dirt, quite a few of the ponies covering their muzzles from the smell. One of them, though, is brave enough to trot forward, giving the leader of the soldiers a small smile, ‘Hello, you’re our new neighbors, right? I’m Doewheat, I’m a baker in the Stable, and when we were told you’d be visiting, well.’ She gives the leader a basket, filled with break, ‘I made you a welcoming gift!’\n\nThe commander takes the basket, looking at the bread inside, then looking up at the mare. A moment passes, ponies watching on from both sides, interested to see his reaction. He smiles at her, ‘Thank you! Crimson Waters is going to be so happy to hear you’re all so welcoming!’ His reaction diffuses tension, as more Stable ponies slowly trot out and begin to talk to the soldiers.\n\nDoewheat smiles widely, ‘I’m glad to hear that! Crimson Waters, she’s your leader, right? The leader of your cu-or, sorry, your religion? I’d be interested in hearing more. Maybe I can even give you a tour of the Stable!’ The commander smiles widely and nods, ‘Happily! Please, lead the way!’ The mare smiles wider and leads him inside, as Stable pony and Cultist begin to talk more amongst themselves, cordial, if not yet friendly."

rustwreck.50.d: "Silverwing Depot, a storied place, once an army base, then abandoned, then taken back by the Mob, used as the headquarters of their small empire. It’s no wonder that the inside of the Depot would be filled with wonders and marvels like nowhere else. Through these walls, Crimson would trot, followed by one of her literate followers, one of the more intelligent of her flock. Crimson picks up something, a metal device, looking it over, ‘You said this device was made purely for the purpose of heating up bread? I remember High Tides mentioned these once or twice. Toasters. I trotted in on him once when he was going feral and he was ranting quietly to himself about these things.’ The follower remains silent behind her, going to another piece of random technology and picking it up, looking it over.\n\nCrimson looks over, seeing the follower is holding up some sort of plastic stick in the general shape of a sword. They press a button on the handle, making the plastic light up a bright green color. The follower looks over, confused, as hoof steps come down the hallway. Wavebreaker trotting down the halls, exploring it himself. He looks at the plastic glowing thing, his eyes widening as he speaks, ‘Is that a Glow-Cutlass from Moon Fights?’ He quickly trots over, picking up another one, which begins to glow blue. He smiles widely, picking up another which glows red, throwing it over to Crimson, ‘We’re fighting with these.’\n\nCrimson catches the red cutlass, looking at it, then shrugging and smiling slightly, ‘This should be fun.’ She charges at Wavebreaker, as the two begin a play fight, except it’s actually way more serious than it should be. She swings with force and speed while he backs up, feinting and dodging, even doing a sick combat roll behind her at one point. He lifts up his saber and brings it down on her leg, smirking as he does, ‘And thus fallest the evil Empress, Crimson Waters, and the galaxy is safe.’ Crimson rolls her eyes and grins, ‘You’re a nerd. To think that ponies used to have the time to waste building this type of stuff."

rustwreck.51.t: "Breaking the Gates of the Damned"
rustwreck.51.d: "Thestrals have never been liked in Equestria, especially not in the slave pits of Fillydelphia. When ponies get desperate, they turn against each other, and pick on the weakest among them, the hated, those to blame. New Moon knew this since birth, she knew this when she was dragged to Fillydelphia, she knew this when she slipped away going between jobs. She’s survived for months now skirting through alleyways stealing what she can, sticking to the shadows, staying out of sight of the slavers. Something happened though, a war, so the whispers say, and a few days ago ponies entered the city. Covered in blood, fighting street to street to take the city, probably just a bunch of psychopathic raiders who would kill her should they find her. But food has gotten scarce now, things are harder now.\n\nNew Moon got clumsy today. She went out during the day to one of those preachers who accompanied the soldiers, and tried to steal something as they passed by, but they noticed. Now, she runs through alleyways, ducking around corners and keeping to the shadows as the preacher chases her down, surely set on killing her, or worse. Eventually she’d come to a halt as she came to a dead end, brick wall in front of her, too tired to even think of flying away. Panting, she slowly turns, as the preacher rounds the corner of the alleyway, looking at her. He breathes heavily, ‘You’re a quick runner.’ He takes a second to catch his breath, before reaching into his robes, slowly taking out a piece of bread. He sets it down, smiling softly, ‘Here, you look hungry. The Endtide is here to help ponies like you. But I know you’re afraid.’ He steps back, giving her a softer smile, ‘If you want more, I’ll be by the exit of this alleyway tomorrow. Perhaps we could talk.’ He turns and leaves, leaving New Moon panting. She slowly steps forward and picks up the bread, looking it over for a moment, before looking after the preacher. If he’s giving out bread, he can’t be too bad, right?"
rustwreck.51.a: "A great city, in rubble again."

rustwreck.52.t: "Checkmate"
rustwreck.52.d: "May the best pony win, I think that was a common saying before the bombs.’ Crimson Waters stands on the roof of the Alpha-Omega Hotel in Fillydelphia, looking around the city, where preachers move from street to street, offering food, water, aid, and faith to the slaves of the city. Prisoners of war would be marched through the streets to prison camps, slavers and raiders from Red Eye, a deactivated Steel Ranger trapped within their own armor after it was hit by a spark grenade, being pulled along in a wagon. A few Mobsters, still causing issues now, even one or two Stable ponies who picked up arms against her. Slaves stand on the side of the road, watching as the enemies are pulled by, not shouting in anger, but merely watching the procession.\n\nA special cart would exit from the inside of the hotel, carrying precious cargo within it. Crimson watches from up high as the cart nears the gates into Fillydelphia, the ‘Gates of the Damned’, which are now wide open for anyone to come and go. Slaves watch just as she does as the cart is slowly opened, and a body is taken from within. Though partly burned, Red Eye’s body is still easily identifiable, especially with his Stable-cloak, which he’s been permitted to keep even after death. No cheer comes as they hang his body from the gates, the slaves are too tired for that. But they do smile. Crimson smiles as well."
rustwreck.52.a: "We have much to do"

rustwreck.53.t: "Those who can be saved"
rustwreck.53.d: "Not everyone we fought against is bad, nor are they deserving of death.’ In the middle of a meeting room sits three individuals, Crimson Waters, Doctor Kelp, and, in front of them both, the slightly battered Protege, protege of Red Eye. Crimson continues, with a small smile, ‘If every pony I fought was bad, Kelp, then you wouldn’t be standing here. Nor would Wavebreaker, wherever he is. Red Eye was bad, yes, but from what the slaves have said, this one is quite nice. For a slaver, some even say he was once a slave himself.’ She looks to Protege, ‘What of you? Are you willing to help?’\n\nProtege looks on as Kelp pours herself a drink and takes a sip of it. She looks at him, sliding him the glass, but he slides it back after a second, without drinking from it, ‘Red Eye was the greatest hope this Wasteland has ever seen, and you killed him. You killed him and put him on display for all to see. You, your cultists, they talk a big game about the betterment of the Wasteland, but I don’t see it. Red Eye did bad, yes, but he built factories, he restored houses, he’s done more than you ever will. Because he was a good pony, a pony of pure-heart who did what was necessary. But you? You’re raiders who smile when you kill somepony.’\n\nCrimson looks on at him, before giving him a wide smile, ‘That’s the correct answer. You see, I admire Red Eye in many ways, you’re right, he’s done much more than anyone else in the Wasteland. But he was tied down by his methods, by the brutality of those who followed him. He’s built a foundation, me, I’m going to add scaffolding, I’m going to add the walls, the floors, heat, electric, but I need help to do that. Call me a raider if you want, but this raider wants you to keep her reigned in.’ She then slides him a piece of paper, ‘You have two options. Say no, go back to the camp you came from, where you will waste away and do nothing. Or make me a list, a list of those who are too far gone, those who deserve to be killed for all to watch. Do that, and I’ll gladly have you by my side. Your choice."

rustwreck.54.t: "The Fillydelphian Constitution"
rustwreck.54.d: "Crimson stands in a room of her closest advisors, some she might even call friends, in Stabletec HQ. Their best scribe sat with a large sheet of paper, writing down what will be the basis of the country going forward, a constitution. Most of it was just defining what was already known to be true across the realm, but one part of it was most important. Crimson would speak to the gathered advisors, and to all those listening by radio, ‘I shouldn’t have to spend too long going over the horrors of slavery, my friends, we’ve seen it first-hoof in Fillydelphia. The idea that one pony can own another is silly, ridiculous, and even worse, it’s inefficient. It is a core tenant of our religion that slavery should not exist, and with this, we will declare it to be over. Every citizen of our faith, in accordance with it, will be freed from the bonds of slavery forevermore.’\n\nWavebreaker looks over from his seat, frowning softly, ‘Of your faith? This is not something which should be restricted to only those who convert, Crimson.’ Crimson looks over at him, smiling widely, ‘Conversion is not necessary, Wavebreaker, nor is belief and faith. By living within my borders, you are a member of the Endtide, because you are under my protection. You may worship Celestia, Luna, some Zebra god, even Nightmare Moon, or nobody at all, and still you will be under my protection. The Endtide is all of us, it is you, it is me, it is everyone listening on the radio.’ She takes a second to take a breath, before grinning softly, ‘And with this decree, I do declare, the Endtide has ended slavery.’"

rustwreck.55.d: "So this is Rustwreck, is it?’ Two ponies trot down the streets in the now city of Rustwreck, by vendors selling food, water, and even one selling flowers, what little exist. One of the two ponies is a mare, Jasmine, carrying a small flower in the collar of a non-combat military uniform. She smiles over to her companion, a short, small stallion who was once a slave in Fillydelphia, smiling more as she speaks, ‘It is. It used to be a lot smaller under the late Admiral. This is what I fought to protect, Pick, all of these ponies.’ He smiles softly, ‘Aww, and here I thought you were conscripted just so you could come free me. I’m hurt, scarred, mortified by your words, woe is me.’ The two laugh a bit as they trot together, until they reach a small house on the outskirts of the city.\n\nJasmine slowly trots up and knocks on the door. A minute passes before it opens, a mare on the other side, around her age, looking at Jasmine like she’s seeing a ghost. Jasmine smiles softly, ‘Tea, I’m back.’ The two mares quickly hug, while Jasmine continues to speak, ‘We’re, umm, going to a volunteer army. So I’m back. For good.’ Tea pulls away from the hug, sniffing a bit, ‘Jasmine, I, I thought you were dead! Two years you’ve been away, no letter, no nothing back!’ She pouts and pushes Jasmine playfully with her hoof, ‘Off to go play soldier-filly.’ Jasmine laughs a bit in response, before leaning in and nuzzling Tea, ‘I’m back, Tea, and I think I’m ready to move on to playing wife for a little bit.’ She smiles, ‘Oh, by the way, this is Pick.’ She motions to her friend, who gives a small wave, ‘I saved him from Fillydelphia and he’s been following me like a lost puppy since then. Can we keep him?’ Jasmine would snicker a bit, followed by Pick, then Tea, as the three begin to fully laugh, the two lovers embracing once more as Pick watches with a soft smile."

rustwreck.56.d: "Radios flick on all across the country, former slaves, soldiers, Stable ponies, cultists, and once raiders would gather around together, sharing food, drinks, and entire blocks gather around the radio. The radio crackles to life, as the voice of Crimson comes from it, speaking softly, ‘Greetings, ponies of the Endtide, ponies of surrounding countries, griffons, diamond dogs, whoever else might be listening. You have all been very faithful in me these past few trying years, and I am grateful for that like you could never imagine. Many of us have died, many of us have been freed, but through it all, our faith has kept us alive, it’s kept us going. But faith isn’t all a country needs, no, a country needs leadership, and I’m afraid to say I’m not immortal. I am no alicorn, not a ghoul, nor any sort of dark magician, I’m a pony, and sometime, I’m going to die.’\n\nAll chatter dies down as everyone listens in, ears perked, ‘I’m going to try something that hasn’t been tried in Equestria before. Then again, that’s nothing new, is it? Nobody in Equestria before has led a cult, a faith, to such wonderful heights, nobody has ever had such a positive effect on those under them. I will be creating a republic, elected by you, the ponies of the nation. I know this will come as a shock to many of you, and many need time to get used to it. In order to ensure stability, I will remain the head of the government for another decade, while we set up an independent parliament and court system. If all goes well, I’ll be able to retire, finally. I happily await your parliamentary runs for election.’ The radio then flicks off.\n\nAll across the nation, ponies would celebrate, or they’d be anxious over the sudden change. Already plans would be drafted and money would be gathered for those hoping to make history as the first elected leaders of their district. Meanwhile, back in her personal office, Crimson swirls a glass of Kelp’s whiskey, taking a sip of it and smirking to herself, ‘I told you all this bloodcult was just a facade. Behold my doubters and despair, not only have I made a better Equestria, but now I can retire.’"
rustwreck.56.a: "They never saw it coming."

rustwreck.57.t: "War never changes. . . but ponies do!"
rustwreck.57.d: "Republic Day, the celebration held on the day that the republic was founded, not the most creative name, and some international observers get it mixed up with The Republic’s Day from The Republic’s founding, but it works. Down in the streets, ponies would drink and eat at banquets and barbecues and the like held out of the churches, all of which is provided by the state, of course. Politicians give speeches vying for election, including Wavebreaker, seeking to become the first prime minister of them all. Up above Crimson stands on a balcony, swirling around a glass of whiskey, sipping from it. Kelp is behind her, working on fixing up some papers in her office, moving more enthusiastically than ever before. She said she’d stop drinking recently, a sober Kelp, well, that’s quite the sight.\n\nCrimson turns her eyes downwards as slaves dance next to ex-Rangers, her loyal cultists as always having fun. She spots a jasmine colored mare trotting alongside a tea colored mare, nuzzling each other as they trot, followed by an ex-slave. A thestral mare, an ex-slave as well, would work alongside a preacher at a local church, cooking and giving away food, some mango-habanero flavored thing. A Stable pony from Stajniopolis would trot alongside a general of the armies, the two talking and having fun. Her eyes fall upon a ghoul, some refugee from Tenpony, talking to a blue unicorn with a silver mane.\n\nCrimson smiles softly, as Kelp looks over, speaking to the doctor, ‘Kelp, you knew him better than I did. Would High Tides have been happy with this? What would he have thought?’ Kelp pauses in her sorting of papers, taking a minute before speaking, ‘I think he’d be proud. But he would never admit it to you, he’d likely nitpick about how you don’t have a strong enough navy, or about how he could have done better. But I think he would be proud. I think he is proud, looking on from whatever afterlife he might have gone to.’ Crimson looks out over the celebrations, the ponies whose stories she doesn’t know, the friends she’s made, and turns her eyes finally to the coast, where ships sit in port. She looks at her drink, and grins slightly, ‘Admiral High Tides, if you didn’t die, I wouldn't be where I am today. You were a cranky ghoul. This one is for you.’ She then pours out the rest of her whiskey, down onto the street below. She sets down the glass, and turns around, giving Kelp a small grin, ‘Only eight more years, Kelp. Let’s get back to work.’"

rustwreck.70.d: "WIP\n\nWavebreaker visits the grave of High Tides. He notes that for the first few weeks after his death, there were always flowers and wreaths around, but now it has grown more sparse. He contemplates the burdens of leadership he now faces, and how he still believes his mentor was much better at it. Heck, even Crimson has an easier time leading ponies and she's crazy. What is he doing wrong? Why can't ponies just listen when he has ideas that would genuinely better their lives?"

(Glowport is a harbour in Light) They have been shanghaied by NavInt and are interrogated for their loyalties. NavInt wants them to poison the food of a particular trader that arrives in the Port the next week. NavInt is certain that said trader will come to the cook's shop. Caps are promised and threats are made, before the scared cook agrees. (NavInt has taken it upon themselves to remove any 'anti-harmonic' elements that may stand in the way of Wavebreaker's reforms. Without his knowledge)"

rustwreck.72.t: "Dusting off old memories"
rustwreck.72.d: "WIP\n\nEvent starts with our POV jumping through multiple scenes. POV is up to you. Should feel disjointed, different experiences without reason stitched together. Afterwards, it is revealed that the POV is testing out a machine that can cycle through different memory orbs, shunting you from memory to memory without having to wake up in between. Wavebreaker wants to preserve as much wartime-knowledge as he can, and memory orbs are a great tool for that!"
rustwreck.72.a: "Onto the next batch"

rustwreck.73.t: "Fervor of youth"
rustwreck.73.d: "WIP\n\nEvent from perspective of a teacher. The Admirality didn't much care for the curriculum before Wavebreaker, but now the plans have changed. A lot of useful information has been provided, much more knowledge of the pre-war era than they had before. However, quite a bit of it is tinged in Propaganda. propaganda against the Admiralities hated foes: The Steel Rangers and the Enclave. Both traitors to Equestria. The Enclave abandoned their motherland wholesale, while the cowardly Steel Rangers hid in their bunkers instead of fulfilling their role as sworn protectors. The foals are eating the narrative up, maybe a bit too much."
rustwreck.73.a: ""

rustwreck.74.t: "Collecting Stamps"
rustwreck.74.d: "WIP\n\nA Trader from Manehattan is trying to get into Rustwreck. Things have changed since they were here the last time. Security is much tighter, the Endtide is no longer trying to convert him on the street-corner and the newspaper and Radio all push the same narrative. It's a nice narrative of striving for a better future together. But they still feel it an eerie contrast to DJPon3 how the radio echoes state opinion almost exactly. They ponder all of this while waiting in line for the fifth and final stamp they need to enter the nation proper."
rustwreck.74.a: "Are they trying to be obtuse?"

rustwreck.75.t: "Past Glories"
rustwreck.75.d: "WIP\n\nWavebreaker has just announced that Ruswreck will reform into the Celestial Sea Fleet once more. Due to concerns about his safety (and to some extend his public speaking ability as well) it was a scripted speech over the Radio. Dr. Kelp, after rushing over to ensure he wasn't trying to end cvilian governance is now drinking in his office. Wavebreaker had kept the plans to sail North up the coast and bring war to the raiders a secret, even from her. Crimson knows, but then again she seems to know everything that is going on in his administration. Nontheless, before the days of war come he decides to take a page out of Kelp's book, and pours himself a glass to calm his nerves."
rustwreck.75.a: "Why does this have to be so difficult?"

rustwreck.76.t: "On a Foundation of Rubble"
rustwreck.76.d: "WIP\n\nWavebreaker and Crimson walk through the newly conquered Summerdale. The Raiders have left the city in a truly abysmal state. Crimson has been given the task of somehow integrating the raiders that were captured back into society. Wavebreaker meanwhile will meet with engineers and architects later today, to discuss plans how Summerdale may be rebuild. Why didn't anyone do this before? Why are they all content to live in rubble? The only ones trying to rebuild Equestria are monsters like Red Eye and that is a parody of order."
rustwreck.76.a: "Another burden to take up."

rustwreck.77.t: "Expensive Toys"
rustwreck.77.d: "WIP\n\nKelp is trying to persuade Wavebreaker away from his plan to buy up vast quantities of memory orbs to acquire more wartime knowledge. She points out that most of the expensive 'toys' he's bought haven't really helped the nation. Include whatever Wartime tech he has bought for examples. Wavebreaker is confident that this idea is different. He produces a SAGE report where the maneframe suggests more detailed wartime-information is needed to rebuild Equestria. Kelp is concerned about how much Wavebreaker is listening to the maneframe, but Wavebreaker dismisses her concerns. He cuts the meeting short, as he has a re-match with crimson in their little board game for a humiliating defeat of yesterday."
rustwreck.77.a: "I know what I'm doing"

rustwreck.78.t: "Fate in Numbers"
rustwreck.78.d: "WIP\n\n§PSAGE§! has finally acquired enough data to predict general trends in the population. Be that consumer trends, spread of diseases or linekly political movements. At this point, a dozen ponies are needed to man §PSAGE§!'s terminals at all hours, as it now spits out several large-scale spreadsheets of collated information every hour. Along with this come recommended courses of action, that go straight to Wavebreakers desk where these proposals then live or die under his stamps. Wavebreaker couldn't be happier. The burden is getting lighter, and the Civilians are finally as predictable as his marines."
rustwreck.78.a: "A great step towards Order and Harmony"

rustwreck.79.t: "Better safe than sorry"
rustwreck.79.d: "WIP\n\nThe ponies of the Sunrise highway have been liberated after years of suffering under the Rain Riders and the Speedfreaks. An extensive program of food-aid and infrastructure-repair has been put in place to integrate them into our nation with all haste. While these ponies are thankful, they also present a bit of a problem.. So many new citizens with a different history and different morals will inevitably compromise the well-laid plans that Wavebreaker and §PSAGE§! have drawn up. To ease the transition, local media and education (as far as it exists in raider-territory) will be dismantled and the propaganda-machine will run overtime for a few months, so our new citizens can get on program. Once we get date flowing in from the new states, §PSAGE§! should be able to adjust."
rustwreck.79.a: "Why am I annoyed at having freed these ponies?"

rustwreck.80.t: "Preserved in Memory"
rustwreck.80.d: "WIP\n\nWavebreaker has decreed, that the city of Rustwreck will be renamed to Tidetown, in honour of the late Admiral. Additionally, a large statue of the Admiral has been comissioned. Wavebreaker wants his mentor to be remembered, otherwise there would be nothing left of his life. The more memory orbs he watches, the clearer it has become to him, that most of these Wartime ponies are forgotten. Not even their own descendants remember their names. As long as this state survives, as long as §PSAGE§! has his transcribed decrees and meetings, Wavebreaker will know that he'l never be forgotten."
rustwreck.80.a: "Comforting, in a way"

rustwreck.81.t: "False memories"
rustwreck.81.d: "WIP\n\nNavInt and one of Wavebreaker's research temas have made a true breakthrough! With a cocktail of chemicals a ponies native memoreis and personality can be temporarily suppressed, and their mind rendered suggestible. In that state they are then fed days worth of memory orbs of peaceful, harmonic actions, as well as ones that instill outright fear of violence and anti-state behaviour. In the aftermath the Raider test-subject had a noticable shift in personality, behaving much more civilized and timidly. The researchers have confirmed that the effects wear off after one to three months, but this is still a great tool to rehabilitate Raiders and other disharmonic elements. Wavebreaker geeks out over the tech."
rustwreck.81.a: "Triple their funding!"

rustwreck.82.t: "Internal Opposition"
rustwreck.82.d: "WIP\n\nDr. Kelp interrupts a meeting of Wavebreaker and Bona fides, the head of NavInt, to confront Wavebreaker about the memory implantation operation. Kelp is Furious about what is basically brainwashing and Wavebreaker can't muster up moch of a defense, mostly having been exited by the technology behind the operation. Boni Fides however will defend the memory Implantation, presenting it as a choice between killing the disharmonic elements, or allowing them back into society, once they have undergone 'treatment'. When Kelp leaves, Fides will ask Wavebreaker if he wants Kelp to be 'dealt with', which a Wavebreaker fervently rejects."
rustwreck.82.a: "Meeting adjourned"

rustwreck.83.t: "White picket fences"
rustwreck.83.d: "WIP\n\nJasmine and Tea (see event rustwreck.55) have been approved for housing in the new 'pre-war district' in Saltpan. The designers of the neighbourhood clearly tried to re-create suburban Equestria with great passion, though some things even they couldn't fix. The grass is still grey-brown and the sky always cloudy. Inside the house a personal 'gift from the Navarch' awaits them, as it does everypony else moving in. A Toaster, fresh out of the factory. A useless luxury in most of the wasteland, but the government has assured the new tenants that the settlement will be provided with electricity at least 18 hours per day."
rustwreck.83.a: ""

rustwreck.84.t: "Background Noise"
rustwreck.84.d: "WIP\n\nThe Admirality building is packed today. Representatives from all over the nation as well the administrative Zones that function as our subjects are here to sign the treaty of Sunrise. The treaty obliges all signatories to freely share their research and spread any new discoveries from the wartime. Wavebreaker, however is too distracted. The delegate from Summerfield brought him a recent find: A mint-condition Protectamini 1000. The minitature version of a Protectapony comes with a remote and over 200 original voice lines. This might be the greatest thing Wavebreaker has ever got his hoof on, much to Crimson's mocking."
rustwreck.84.a: "Miracles of the past indeed."

rustwreck.85.t: "The Voice of the Wasteland"
rustwreck.85.d: "WIP\n\nTenpony has been conquered, the Celestial Sea Fleet lies at anchor on the Southern shore, turrets still trained on the city to pre-empt any attempts at resistance. Wavebreaker and Crimson are meeting with the surviving leadership of the Tower, now led by Homage. (Include other Tenpony Characters if you want). Wavebreaker admires these ponies for keeping so much wartime culture alive, but also thinks of them as cowards for never trying to spread it into the wasteland. Nontheless, he wants these ponies to work with him, to help in the colossal task of rebuilding Manehattan."
rustwreck.85.a: ""

rustwreck.86.t: "Plans in Shadow"
rustwreck.86.d: "WIP\n\nEvent follows Bona Fides, leader of NavInt. He is meeting with some NavInt agents in the maintenance rooms of an old water-treatment plan. Among them are a Ghoul that formerly worked for the MoM as well as an agent on 'loan' from the Sterling Society of Detrot. What they talk about is immaterial, but it needs to be made clear that these guys are devoted to Wavebreakers vision of bringing back wartime Equestria, to the point of killing for it and removing obstacles in Wavebreaker's path, even if he doesn't want them to."
rustwreck.86.a: "We act for the good of Ponykind, after all"

rustwreck.87.t: "Democracy is obsolete"
rustwreck.87.d: "WIP\n\nEquestria has always been ruled by a benevolent autocracy. The Princesses might have give their government more palatable names, but in the end they were rulers above question. Over the last 200 years many have forgotten how well this paradigm served ponykind for over a milennia. We will continue on in their grand tradition. By order of Wavebreaker all national political organizations are immediately dissolved. All positions above the rank of 'Mayor' will be assigned by the National pacification Government. In absence of the Princesses, a council of experts, led by Wavebreaker, will assume leadership of Equestria."
rustwreck.87.a: "It was a griffonian idea to begin with"

rustwreck.88.t: "Cowards in Armor"
rustwreck.88.d: "WIP\n\nThe Manehattan Contingent has been defeated. The fight was a hard one, while our marines match knights in their discipline and training, power armor still gave the enemy an advantage. In the end the Rangers were forced away from the River by out navy and then slowly ground down in the outskirts of Manehattan. Cottage Cheese is dead, as is much of Ranger leadership. Crossroads however, is still alive, her and her 'Applejack's Rangers' having surrendered before the fighting got bad. A curious group they are, trying to emulate the honour of their wartime counterparts. If only the rest of them thought that way. The Steel Rangers would stay gone for a long time, but Wavebreaker tasks Crossroads with rebuilding the organization in the background, intending to reveal them onsce the 'False Rangers' have been purged from the wasteland."
rustwreck.88.a: "Diamonds among coal"

rustwreck.89.t: "Midnight Visitors"
rustwreck.89.d: "WIP\n\nDr. Kelp returns home late at night. In her house she finds Bona Fides, her assistant as well as another NavInt agent. Fides threatens her about opposing Wavebreaker too much, and being close to a disharmonic element. Kelp asks if they would kill her for that. Fides assures that is not the case, not when they have better methods now. He commands Kelp's assistant to do things, and the assistant follows the orders without question. NavInt can make enemies into allies now, free will be damned. So, if she wants to keep her own mind about her, it's better she opts for genuine loyalty, otherwise they'll give her artificial one."
rustwreck.89.a: "Good evening Ma'am"

rustwreck.90.t: "Equality for all"
rustwreck.90.d: "WIP\n\nWartime Equestria was the greatest nation to ever exist, Wavebreaker has no doubts. However, even they made numerous mistakes. Among the biggest was giving Industrial conglomerates too much power and letting ponies of wealth like Horse and Blueblood influence their politics too much. That problem will be dealt with at the root. As of this morning all companies over a certain size will be nationalized. In addition, all weath beyond 5 million caps will be subject to a tax rate of 100%. Anypony that has a problem with that can bring it up with NavInt."
rustwreck.90.a: "Failiure is the best teacher"

rustwreck.91.t: "The Factories lie still"
rustwreck.91.d: "WIP\n\nWavebreaker has only ever seen Fillydelphia from miles away on his ship. Now, he strides through one of the gaps in the wall created by the fleet's bombardement. As always, he is surrounded by Bodyguards, assistants and ponies wanting him to sign this or that. He is only alone in his sleep, and even then he is frequently woken when issues come up. He wonders if Red Eye led a similar life, did they chase the same goal with such different methods? He can't ask him, the Slaver-Lord of Fillydelphia is dead, killed by a raider clan that was enslaved. When battle arrived at the city, his personal security was caught lacking. Wavebreaker would not make the same mistake, he would even be guarded in his sleep now."
rustwreck.91.a: "No rest until Equestria stands again"

rustwreck.92.t: "Now and Forever"
rustwreck.92.d: "WIP\n\nThe Lab had been cleared of most of the scientists, in their place Wavebreakers dozens of armed guards. Nowadays he didn't visit a place without his marines having cleared the buildings and NavInt snipers on all nearby rooves. Today, he hoped to find a panacea against his growing paranoia. As he sits down in the machine, the head scientist explains that the machine will sift through his memories, discarding unimportant ones and transcribing the rest onto 60 memory orbs. With this, Wavebreaker will be, in a sense, immortal. Even if he were to die, his memories could be implanted into a new pony, and while it would only 90% him, it would be enough. He knew his duty, he would lead Equestria into a better future, and death was only a disharmonic variable in that plan."
rustwreck.92.a: "Begin the process"

rustwreck.93.t: "Clear Skies"
rustwreck.93.d: "WIP\n\nOn the Surface, the Enclave has been beaten back. But still New Cloudsdale hangs high in the sky. Too high for our naval guns to reach. But there is something else our guns can target. SPP towers. Of course, not every one of them is close to the coast, and we can only fire a few miles inland, but it's a start. On the refurbished HMS Sunrise, his mentor's flagship from the Wartime, Wavebreaker gives the command and 22 Ships open fire on an SPP tower he can't even see from this distance. After half a minute the sound arrives at the fleet and ponies wait with baited breath. 3 more minutes pass in near total silence, before the first ray of Sunshine breaches the Cloudcover. Cheers erupt and even the exhausted Wavebreaker can't help but smile."
rustwreck.93.a: "Equestria, we return the sun to you"

rustwreck.94.t: "Heavy is the Crown"
rustwreck.94.d: "WIP\n\nENDING EVENT FOR PATH! Wavebreaker reads the letter from Dr. Kelp once again. She is leaving, fleeing as she puts it. Fleeing from the regime that he built. Wavebreaker feels that he should be angry, or sad but he is just tired. Without Mint-als he can't even make it through his days, which are 18 hours of work most time. Crimson and Bona Fides are helping him out, but it is still so much to bear. Perhaps you truly have to be a Goddess to rule Equestria well. Wavebreaker will have to manage anyways, he is the best hope for the wasteland. Water is clean, electricity is plenty and raiders are a thing of the past. The price they paid was light, all things considered. Wavebreaker looks outside, only to be startled at seeing the rising sun. Has he been working the entire night? Oh well, no sleep today then. He smoothes out his uniform and calls for an assitant to bring breakfast."
