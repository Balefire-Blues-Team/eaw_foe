rustwreck.1.t:0 "Rustwreck seeks to renew trade-ties"
rustwreck.1.d:0 "WIP\n\nRustwreck wants to expand trade with us (Light), mainly constructing a trade-road between Valkyrie's Point and the Bend. This would be beneficial for both of us, though our Overlords (The Ringers) will likely be angry that we're trading with outside powers."
rustwreck.1.a:0 "Accept the deal"
rustwreck.1.b:0 "Reject the deal"

rustwreck.2.t:0 "Light accepts the deal"
rustwreck.2.d:0 "WIP\n\nMayor Doughnut of Light has accepted out proposal for renewed trade ties. Industry in both the Bend and Valkyrie's Point will undoubtedly increase!"
rustwreck.2.a:0 "Cooperation wins again"

rustwreck.3.t:0 "Light rejects the deal"
rustwreck.3.d:0 "WIP\n\nMayor Doughnut has rejected our generous deal. It seems there will be no new trade-road between our lands and Lights. We will reinvest the caps allocated for the construction to try and encourage settlement in the territory."
rustwreck.3.a:0 "We will survive without them"

rustwreck.4.t:0 "The Scourge of the Sea"
rustwreck.4.d:0 "WIP\n\nHigh Tides needs to decide how to deal with a band of Pirates/Raiders called the 'Razorsharks'. They have their base on an old offshore Mining-Rig that is too valuable to just bombard. Wavebreaker suggests that we simply fight the raiders on sea and on the shores until their numbers are depleted enough that they flee. Doctor Kelp, who has treated some of the Raider captives, is confident that she could strike a deal with the Raiders, wherein we pay tribute for some time, in order for them to leave the Rig and move on to other places. There is also a hastily scrawled proposal by Crimson Waters in what he hopes is just red ink. Crimson seems to think that if she can get a meeting with the raiders, she could convert them to her cult, though if we should trusts that madmare is another question."
rustwreck.4.a:0 "Let's wipe these Raiders"
rustwreck.4.b:0 "We shall spend caps, not blood"
rustwreck.4.c:0 "Let Crimson do her thing"

rustwreck.5.t:0 "Mission Accomplished"
rustwreck.5.d:0 "WIP\n\nThe Razorsharks have been soundly beaten! Though we have taken a number of casualties ourselves the Raider threat will never rise again. Wavebreaker and some naval engineers are now inspecting the 'Orichalcum' the Mining Rig that the Razorsharks had used as their base of operations. There is certainly a lot to slavage here!"
rustwreck.5.a:0 "The Navy does not tolerate piracy!"

rustwreck.6.t:0 "Without a drop of blood shed"
rustwreck.6.d:0 "WIP\n\nThough controversial, Doctor Kelps strategy worked. After receiving the last of their tribute, the Razorsharks abandoned the mining Rig 'Orichalcum' and left peacefully. Many apploud Kelp's strategy, defeating raiders without shedding a single drop of blood on either side. Others are skeptical, especially since it appears that the Razorsharks will join up with the Rain Riders, creating a stronger foe to our north."
rustwreck.6.a:0 "Violence isn't always the answer."

rustwreck.7.t:0 "Together against he Tides"
rustwreck.7.d:0 "WIP\n\nCrimson Waters is attending a feast with members of the Endtide as well as many new converts from the Razorsharks. Stranglevine, leader of the Razorsharks is there as well. Razorshark is an utter moron has bought the Endtide's prophecy in full. Crimson will, as always, outwardly act like the crazed Cult-leader, while finding the whole affair rather unsophisticated in her inner monologue."
rustwreck.7.a:0 "Bound by blood, we are one!"

rustwreck.8.t:0 "Trade Fleet from Rustwreck"
rustwreck.8.d:0 "WIP\n\nA trade-fleet from rustwreck has arrived in our port. While we already have some trade-ties with them, they are proposing a lowering of tariffs and increased economic integration to our mutual benefit."
rustwreck.8.a:0 "Prosperity for us all"
rustwreck.8.b:0 "We shouldn't give them too much ground"

rustwreck.9.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] welcomes our Trade-Fleet"
rustwreck.9.d:0 "WIP\n\n [FROM.GetName] has agreed to increased economic cooperation and a deepening of trade ties."
rustwreck.9.a:0 "Caps make the world go round"
