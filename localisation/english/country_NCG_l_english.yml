 NCG_wartime_pre:0 "Our Wartime Predecessors"
 NCG_wartime_pre_desc:0 "The Great War was one of the best things to ever happen to us. The economy was booming, profits were seemingly endless, and worker protection laws went all but entirely unenforced. However, it wasn't to last. On that fateful day that the megaspells detonated across Equestria, so many countless investment portfolios crashed, and so many of our shareholders died. The economy was in tatters. Now, we have gathered up our wealth and we stand poised to once again become the economic heart of this blasted Wasteland."
 
 NCG_profit_stop:0 "The Day Profit Ended"
 NCG_profit_stop_desc:0 "That day was a true reckoning. There were few customers in the immediate aftermath of the War, the profit margins were virtually nil. However, we did not let this stop us. The good Guilds saw the suffering around them and became determined to create a bastion of economic freedom, which was the only way out of the mess left by the apocalypse. Rebuilding begins with money. This, we ponies and griffons can surely come to an agreement on."
 
 NCG_200_rebuild:0 "200 Years of Rebuilding"
 NCG_200_rebuild_desc:0 "It has been two centuries since then and we did not spend that time in idleness. No, we have been hard at work rebuilding all that was lost, driven by that same determined work ethics that once drove us to create some of the largest corporations to have ever existed. One day, our process of rebuilding this delicate network of trade, assets, and a loyal customer base will be completed. Only then will we be satisfied. For now, we rebuild and bide our time."
 
 NCG_board_meeting:0 "Meeting of the Board of Directors"
 NCG_board_meeting_desc:0 "Every four years, the highest ranking members of upper-management within each Guild meets. They are collectively known as the Board of Directors, and are those ponies tasked with always making sure that the cogs of profit continue to turn. Even the most powerful and most efficient machine needs a strong guiding hoof to make sure it all functions. Perhaps, then, our Board of Directors serves the true purpose of being our guides in this era of risk and profit."
 
 NCG_issue_caps:0 "On the Issue of Caps"
 NCG_issue_caps_desc:0 "The Greater Wasteland Market is known for having a singular common currency, that being the bottlecap. Though we often still use the old Equestrian bit within our domestic market, every deal made with those outside of Neocastle is done using only caps. While this has thus far served to enhance our profit margins considerably, some concerns have been made regarding this rogue currency and the consequences that could be faced if we continue to rely heavily upon it."
 
 NCG_stance_fillydelphia:0 "Our Stance on Fillydelphia"
 NCG_stance_fillydelphia_desc:0 "Long ago, the city of Fillydelphia was transformed by necessity into a major industrial hub dedicated to pumping out a constant stream of weapons, supplies, and goods to keep the war effort marching forward. Though it lost this reputation following it being blown to Tartarus, the efforts of one innovative stallion by the name of Red Eye resulted in the city being partially restored within recent history. Smog once again stretches up into the sky as the mighty factories churn out their products once more. Unfortunately, this has made the city into a sizable competitor to our own operations, and we must decide how to handle this rival moving forward."
 
 NCG_how_to_workers_rights:0 "A Matter of Worker's Rights"
 NCG_how_to_workers_rights_desc:0 "A common perception among the upper-ranking ponies within Neocastle's society is that the largely impoverished masses at the bottom of the vast machine of profit are there for a reason. Namely that they are simply just not as industrious nor as talented as those at the top. After all, if they were, they would be able to climb the ladder of their own merits like so many have before them. As a result, there is no pressing obligation to provide them with anything, least of all any semblance of respect. However, there also exist some who, for one reason or another, advocate for a softer approach when approaching those of lower status. What form this takes varies widely, but there are rumors that even some of the highest ranking ponies within the Guilds may hold such sentiments..."
 
 NCG_corruption_problem:0 "Addressing Corruption"
 NCG_corruption_problem_desc:0 "Though it may be true that corruption generally renders our operations less efficient, it is also true that it is oftentimes the only method through which we can get things done. Better we get results than go around pointing hooves against those only looking out for their own interests, or so many within the Guilds believe. However, not everyone is so complacent, and some push for action to be taken against what they see as a severe problem within our nation."
 
 NCG_industry_mil_entagle:0 "The Military-Industrial Entanglement"
 NCG_industry_mil_entagle_desc:0 "The rather pitiful state of our security forces, especially when compared to the rapidly expanding arms industry, has raised questions regarding the wisdom of selling so many of our weapons to the same types of ponies who would plunder our land without hesitation. This has been a matter of heavy debate among the middle-ranking members of each Guild for a while now, but it has received relatively little attention from those at the top, who are just more than happy to continue reaping in the profits. Until now, of course."
 
 NCG_new_ceo:0 "Choosing a Director"
 NCG_new_ceo_desc:0 "The final issue always brought before the Board of Directors is the matter of selecting a single leader to be the figurehead of our nation. For the last several meetings, this has ended in a stalemate with the Trade Council being granted this position by default. However, the Guilds haven't held back in the slightest over the last few years, pulling every trick in their books to win this one crucial vote. With all three sides in this matter fully invested in achieving a position of power over the others, it remains to be seen who will come out on top."
 
 NCG_trade_supremacy:0 "Consumerism Uber Alles"
 NCG_trade_supremacy_desc:0 "Our way of life is defined by the relationship of a pony to the products of our coporations. Corporate wants more consumers, so long as products are on the shelves and there are little ponies who buy them, then our way of life is secured. The best way to serve society is through being employees by day and consumers by night. All ponies, regardless of who they are, can fulfil this purpose. Here, we safeguard the fundamental right to buy products free of the interference so common to the other parts of the Wasteland."
 
 NCG_make_a_deal_with_BOG:0 "The Bog Buyout"
 NCG_make_a_deal_with_BOG_desc:0 "To our northwest lies Froggy Bottom Bog, a large wetland that is considered of low strategic value to its neighbors. Though the ponies living there have largely reverted to tribalism over the centuries, a few bright-minded individuals among them have recently unified the land against those nations who they view as an impending threat to their way of life. However, they know as well as anyone that their lack of industry, infrastructure, and viable soldiers makes them easy-pickings for anypony so inclined. Let us offer them a solution in exchange for nothing less than their subservience."
 
 NCG_trade_with_MWY:0 "Tea in Mareway"
 NCG_trade_with_MWY_desc:0 "New Mareway is our largest immediate competitor, being host to a thriving economic scene. Their merchants and our own have been engaged in a fiery rivalry for generations now, often making every effort possible to undercut eachother. However, what if it didn't have to be that way? We will extend our hoof out in friendship to our eastern rival, out of the hope that they could become our eastern partner instead. After all, cooperation is far better for business within both of our nations."
 
 NCG_pan_azuria_supply_chain:0 "Envision Pan-Azurian Supply Chains"
 NCG_pan_azuria_supply_chain_desc:0 "Though we are blessed to be within one of the most profitable regions within all of post-war Equestria, there are still countless natural obstacles to trade. Forests, mountains, and vast fields of nothingness all make long-distance trade difficult for all but the most well prepared caravans. However, we believe that it doesn't have to be this way. The future could be one with countless toll roads, thriving privatized canals, and maybe someday even a railroad to charge for the use of. With a little bit of investment, previously unheard of levels of trade could flow as our profit margins rise."
 
 NCG_froggy_bottom:0 "Subsidize BogWoods(TM) Industry"
 NCG_froggy_bottom_desc:0 "Our subsidiary has done admirably thus far, but there is no shortage of operational problems facing them within the confines of such a vile bog. To help them overcome the natural hurdles which have been thrown before them, we will secure for them a sizable subsidy. With it, we hope for them to expand their operations in spite of their environment. It is our hope that they will someday be worthy of calling themselves a Neocastle-backed corporation."
 
 NCG_smaller_duchies:0 "Approach the Dukes and Counts"
 NCG_smaller_duchies_desc:0 "The decentralized nature of New Mareway's feudal system might have held back their industry, but for us it's nothing but an asset. We can play the different nobles against eachother to get better deals, and even sponsor the ones friendly to us, so that we gain more influence over their nation."
 
 NCG_unequal_treaty:0 "The Unequal Treaty"
 NCG_unequal_treaty_desc:0 "Now some would say our methods of signing unequal treaties may be objectionable but our response should always be to slap some sense into them. A proper businesspony always understands when to take advantage of a deal and to make it work in their favour. If the results disproportionately favour us, then they should have hired a better negotiator. Simple as that! We even have plenty of negotiators to hire out as consultants! Such is the art of the deal. Of course, our subsidiary may not agree with us on that, but isn't that just even more evidence that we should directly oversee their operations in order to ensure maximum efficiency?"
 
 NCG_market_strategy:0 "Dynamic Generation of Market Altering Strategies"
 NCG_market_strategy_desc:0 "Though the Mechanicum has often held a monopoly over the field of computing within our nation, that doesn't mean that we haven't been able to secure a stash of advanced electronics for our own usage. With a few discrete deals and a bit of well-greased hooves, we could even secure a few of the Engineers to work under-the-table for us on this project. The purpose of this aforementioned project? To design an AI specifically for the purpose of manipulating the market to ensure we always come out on top."
 
 NCG_company_rearrangement:0 "Retire Unproductive Managers"
 NCG_company_rearrangement_desc:0 "The Builder's Guild employs a great many ponies, far more so than even our peers within the nation. It is inevitable that some of these ponies may, for one reason or another, simply be unfit for performing the tasks expected of them. Laziness, incompetence, and simple disability from age all plague the ranks of our middle management. Not only does this reflect poorly on us, but it also is often the source of a great deal of stress among those under them. Though we can't just terminate such a large number of personnel, we could 'encourage' them to willingly resign."
 
 NCG_meritocratise_hiring:0 "Meritocratise Low-End Positions"
 NCG_meritocratise_hiring_desc:0 "For a long time now, we have relied on mostly unskilled uneducated indentured workers as our menial labor personnel. Though this has seen some success, it is unfortunately also very inefficient. In order to ensure a more motivated and skilled baseline for our Guild, we will begin to phase out the less talented servants and offer incentives for those who show actual work ethic."
 
 NCG_disinterminate_corpo_command:0 "Disinterminate Corporate Chain of Command"
 NCG_disinterminate_corpo_command_desc:0 "Though proper bueracratic processes are necessary to the efficient functioning of any large company, it is undeniable that our Guild has perhaps taken it a bit too far. Our ponies often need the approval of numerous higher managers in order to move forward with the simplest of tasks, reducing overall efficiency and creating a production bottleneck within our structure. Well, no more! We shall set about fixing this problem immediately by slashing unnecessary protocols and putting a greater deal of trust in our on-ground personnel. Sure, this could cause a few problems here and there, but the increased productivity is more than worth it."
 
 NCG_synergy_employee:0 "Synergistic Hiring Methods"
 NCG_synergy_employee_desc:0 "If there is one thing that is crucial in ensuring operational efficiency, it is teamwork. Something which is sadly lacking within our Guild. We have near incentivized the recruitment of cutthroat ponies interested only in furthering their own goals for a long while now and it is time we bring an end to this. From now on, we shall weigh the compatability of each new employee we hire or promote with our existing team to ensure that we can remain as functional as possible."
 
 NCG_crack_down_corruption:0 "Crack Down on Middle Management Corruption"
 NCG_crack_down_corruption_desc:0 "Our Middle Management has become a veritable cesspool of corruption, often going out of their way to provide favors for their friends and forge under-the-table deals with other ponies to rise further in the ranks. In order to tackle this issue, we will simply get rid of those most corrupt, as an example for the remainder. Anyone that has charges of corruption brought against them will henceforth be re-assigned to serve in Corporate Security as a basic grunt. Maybe their act will be cleaned up after a bit of hard work out in the field."
 
 NCG_blood_rnd:0 "Expanding Research and Development"
 NCG_blood_rnd_desc:0 "Though we are certainly far greater than the many primitive tribes that dot the Wasteland, we still are lacking when it comes to technological prowess. What kind of company would we be if we didn't make every effort to remain competitive within this field?"
 
 NCG_housing_employ:0 "Allow Employees to Vote for Management"
 NCG_housing_employ_desc:0 "Now that we have gotten rid of many middle-management ponies in our corruption-purges, it is time we fill those positions again. We will give our employees the illusion of democracy by letting them elect ponies to these rather meaningless positions, both creating a stronger family identity within the Guild and ensuring that those elected must maintain at least the illusion of being effective. Of course, we will ensure that no potential trouble-makers manage to be elevated by this system."
 
 NCG_model_employ:0 "The New Model Employee"
 NCG_model_employ_desc:0 "The other Guilds may be content with a lazy inefficient work force that cares less about their jobs than their employers, but not us! Within our Guild, there is a strong sense of pride from the lowest ranks to the highest, with each and every pony being reminded constantly that their work truly matters. Let us work as one big corporate family towards our shared goal of peace, prosperity, and profit."
 
 NCG_define_consumer:0 "Defining Consumers"
 NCG_define_consumer_desc:0 "Consumer: Anypony who we can market and sell goods or services to. Potential Consumer Population: The entirety of Neocastle and beyond. With this in mind, we will begin marketing to just about every demographic we can think of. Employees, rivals, raiders, tribals, slavers, and even Talons are all nothing but potential customers. We'll sell to any and all, so long as they have the money to pay for it."
 
 NCG_nation_for_sale:0 "Nation for Sale!"
 NCG_nation_for_sale_desc:0 "With our investments made and our market operations expanded, we have successfully maximized our profit margins. However, as an unfortunate consequence of this, we are running out of options to further increase our potential revenue. Thankfully, the Builder's Guild prepared a plan for just this scenario! We will put our very nation itself on the table, making the greatest transaction in the history of capitalism!"
 
 NCG_equestrian_copyright:0 "One Equestria Under Copyright"
 NCG_equestrian_copyright_desc:0 "With our company reformed and our trading steady, now is the perfect time to pursue corporate growth. Over the horizon is limitless opportunity, all sorts of new profitable markets, and an endless supply of potential customers. Though the risks are many, they are few in comparison to the money we stand to make."
 
 NCG_trade_with_appleloosa:0 "Sell Sand in the Desert"
 NCG_trade_with_appleloosa_desc:0 "How does one sell sand to ponies with an endless supply of it under their hooves? The answer is simple: All we must do is convince them of the merit of our sand. After all, it is the finest sand from across the entire Wasteland, ran through a aerial-motion purification process multiple times in order to ensure only the most refined grain. You can't find finer sand anywhere else."
 
 NCG_trade_manehattan:0 "Caravans to Manehattan"
 NCG_trade_manehattan_desc:0 "Manehatten is a previously untapped market full of limitless potential. From the luxury customers of Tenpony to the lower-class customers of Friendship City, there is no shortage of potential trading partners within the Heartland's largest city. It's time to move into this exciting new market and meet any needs they may have."
 
 NCG_everfree_aquisition:0 "The Everfree Coup"
 NCG_everfree_aquisition_desc:0 "Though Red Eye tried his hardest to tame the wild Everfree Forest, he was unable to completely suppress the endless hordes of monsterous creatures, violent flora, and surprisingly well organized hellhounds. They have continued to be a thorn in Fillydelphia's side, fighting tooth and claw against them from within the expanse of the southern Everfree. Fortunately for us, this war of attrition has left the mob of monsters in a greatly weakened state. With their demise at the hooves of Fillydelphia growing ever closer, we can't help but wonder if the hellhounds may be civilized enough to sign a contract with the lesser evil..."
 
 NCG_everfree_integrate:0 "Train the New Employees"
 NCG_everfree_integrate_desc:0 "Our newest employees have proven to be equally eager and loyal to serve our corporate interests. That being said, hellhounds aren't exactly known for their ability to hold a 9 to 5 job. Fortunately, with a bit of training and plenty of incentives, we believe we can whip them into being the very image of star employees."
 
 NCG_sub_companies:0 "Form Company Sub-Divisions"
 NCG_sub_companies_desc:0 "It's long past time that we face the hard truth of the matter: There is simply too much land in Equestria for us to hold it all. The Heartlands alone is a vast region, with far more customers than we could ever dream of meeting the needs of. Fortunately, Brick believes he's devised a solution. Rather than trying to forge one vast corporation that handles everything, we could instead create many individual specialized companies that operate on a more local level. In this way, we would both be reinforcing our ability to meet varied consumer needs and making it far easier to handle a greatly expanded employee base."
 
 NCG_azure_management:0 "New Management in Azuria"
 NCG_azure_management_desc:0 "Raiders playing at nation building are no substitute for good and proper civilization. It's about time we seek to free the markets of the Azurian region through aggressive market expansion against the local monopoly. We do this not just for the sake of our own profit margins, but for the good of the consumers themselves. Only through us can wealth flow freely down the river."
 
 NCG_everfree_management:0 "Expand Everfree Holdings"
 NCG_everfree_management_desc:0 "Our operations in the southern Everfree have thus far proven successful. The natural course of action to expand upon this revolutionary strategy by pursuing further expansion into the rest of that dreadful forest. It is our hope that the hellhounds under our employ will prove to be very useful when it comes to convincing the rest of their kin as to the merits of a proper wage."
 
 NCG_from_citizen_to_employee:0 "Corporate Expansionism"
 NCG_from_citizen_to_employee_desc:0 "With our new holdings secured, we can now undergo the process of consolidating our control over our newly expanded customer base. Let the money flow as we enter a new age of capitalistic success. What is but one small expansion today will lay the foundation for our domination over the entirety of the Heartlands tomorrow!"
 
 NCG_corporate_takeover:0 "Hostile Takeover of New Mareway"
 NCG_corporate_takeover_desc:0 "Many of our efforts have been leading up to this moment. The time has come at last for us to expand out to the sea. All that stands in the way of our eastward market expansion is the feudal state of New Mareway and their raider rivals to the north. Fortunately, we now stand ready to deal with both of them in one fell swoop and secure our market dominance over the entirety of the Amethyst Basin."
 
 NCG_feudo_corpo:0 "Establish a Feudo-Corpocracy"
 NCG_feudo_corpo_desc:0 "While we may take issue with many of the feudal traditions of New Mareway, we can't deny that some aspects of their system worked remarkably well. We may not be nobles, but 'Lord Manager' has a nice ring to it. To help usher in this new reform and to aid in rapidly integrating our new holdings, we will offer positions in upper management to many of the former nobles who have found themselves reduced to luxury customers under our occupation."
 
 NCG_raider_employment:0 "Employment for the Raiders"
 NCG_raider_employment_desc:0 "Raiders are simply misguided and uneducated survivors who haven't been afforded the same opportunities as civilized ponies. Well, no longer we say! From this day forward, the Brick-Rehabilitation Foundation will seek to provide charitable aid to any and all disenfranchised criminality-oriented ponies who just need a chance to turn a new leaf in life. Of course, those who refuse this generous offer of help will be sent off to work in one of our many mines for the remainder of their vastly shortened lives."
 
 NCG_neo_conglomerate:0 "The Neocastle Conglomerate"
 NCG_neo_conglomerate_desc:0 "Our company is vast and our profits even vaster. When Brick set out to reform the Guilds into something truly worthy of their heritage, he never could have dreamed of the success which we have now achieved. Nothing will stand between our newly supercharged brand blueprint and the near endless wealth that is now within our grasp."
 
 NCG_ceo_bonus:0 "Massive Bonuses All Around"
 NCG_ceo_bonus_desc:0 "We've put in the work, now it's time to reap the rewards. In response of the continued diligence of our most beloved personnel, we have decided to give out large bonuses to those who our Guild relies on the most: Our Vice Presidents. If they wish to remain competitive employers, it would be for the best if the other two Guilds similarly rewarded their own higher ups."
 
 NCG_employee_slaves:0 "Buy Out the Debt"
 NCG_employee_slaves_desc:0 "So many ponies within our fair nation labor away towards the impossible, kept going by nothing more than a faint hope that their foal's foals may finally be free of the crippling debt which has kept them down for so long. We say, no longer! The time has come for us to end this barbaric practice of indentured servitude, to remove the artificial monetary shackles forced upon our less fortunate. Effective immediately, the Miner's Guild will assume the debts of each and every one of those poor souls. Of course, by owning their debts, we also own them as well. It is only right that they work for us, to repay our endless generosity and benevolence."
 
 NCG_maximum_suppression:0 "Preemptive Security Measures"
 NCG_maximum_suppression_desc:0 "Ever since the disbandment of the Security Guild, our asset protection strategy has been largely reactive rather than proactive. Movements like the accursed Union were able to brew and simmer right under our noses, ultimately leading to the situation in West Amethyst. Well, no more, we say! The time has come for a drastic change to our security strategy moving forward, with a far larger focus on catching potential threats long before they grow into a crisis."
 
 NCG_utilize_corruption:0 "Greasing Hooves"
 NCG_utilize_corruption_desc:0 "Money makes the world go round. This is a truth that has formed the foundation for our very way of life. Why should we shy away from this fact in some misguided attempt to 'tackle corruption'? If our ponies are motivated by wealth and wealth alone, that just makes them successful and everypony else poor. The time has arrived for us to recognize that bribery is a perfectly valid business venture and source of revenue."
 
 NCG_send_mines:0 "Expand the Mines"
 NCG_send_mines_desc:0 "Our recent 'reforms' have left us with far more ponies than our current facilities can handle, creating a bit of an unemployment crisis. Fortunately, the mines can always use more able-bodied ponies to drive us ever further into the depths. So long as we can keep workplace accidents at an acceptable level, our enlarged employee base will fuel our mining expansion for decades to come."
 
 NCG_increase_quota:0 "Strictly Enforce Quotas"
 NCG_increase_quota_desc:0 "It seems the ponies who we have graciously assumed the debts of are near entirely ungrateful towards our efforts. Day after day, they slack off on the job and fail to meet their quotas. It's time we beat some sense into these rabble and remind them of the consequences of failing to meet expectations."
 
 NCG_chance_slavery:0 "A Chance to Escape Poverty"
 NCG_chance_slavery_desc:0 "Nopony likes to be poor, and yet most ponies are. We will present one additional chance for those ruthless and uncaring enough to take it: Join Equine Resources to earn a decent living wage, while also being able to lord your influence over your lessers."
 
 NCG_tap_into_slavetrade:0 "Tap into the Slavetrade"
 NCG_tap_into_slavetrade_desc:0 "Slaves are traded like any other commodity across the Wasteland. It's a previously untapped market, one which we could benefit greatly from but have always held back from expanding into. Now that we have cast aside our petty 'moral' concerns regarding owning thinking beings, we can finally embrace one of the oldest industries in the Wasteland."
 
 NCG_young_workers:0 "Make Slavery the Centre of the Economy"
 NCG_young_workers_desc:0 "Employees are a messy affair, what with their contracts and 'pony rights'. Instead of relying on these rather unreliable ponies, it's time for us to harden our industry by phasing out free-personnel in favor of slave assets. They will work until they drop and they won't complain if they know what's good for them. What more could we possibly want in a worker?"
 
 NCG_dig_deeper:0 "Dig Ever Deeper"
 NCG_dig_deeper_desc:0 "The riches of the earth are within our reach. We shall dig ever deeper, scouring more and more until our hoards rival even those of the mightiest dragons. Copper, iron, silver, gold, gems, and much more shall be ours! Keep digging! Deeper!"
 
 NCG_engine_war:0 "Begin Chemical Weapons Manufacturing"
 NCG_engine_war_desc:0 "With our industrial capabilities increasing by the day, we can begin producing more 'interesting' kinds of weapons. Chief among them are several varients of chemical weapons, mostly poisonous gasses, which were used to great effect by the zebras in the Great War.\n\n§ROthers may see it as an atrocity, but this is simply efficient!§!"
 
 NCG_pact_bloodmane:0 "Propose a Pact to Bloodmane"
 NCG_pact_bloodmane_desc:0 "Like ourselves, Bloodmane seeks to overthrow the order of New Mareway, and while we may have different end-goals, we can still work together to see [MWY.GetLeader] brought down! We will approach the Bloody Army with an offer:\nWe will enter into a non-aggression pact and send them some weapons-schematics, while they send some of their experienced soldiers to train our army."
 
 NCG_take_out_mwy:0 "Seize the Riches of Mareway"
 NCG_take_out_mwy_desc:0 "The time has come for us to deal with the greatest threat to our rule. The resource-rich lands of New Mareway and all of their wealth shall be ours. This shall be our greatest moment, the battle that will define our nation moving forward. March, for profit!"
 
 NCG_moving_central_basin:0 "Re-Arrange the Central Basin"
 NCG_moving_central_basin_desc:0 "The Central Basin is full of valuable gems, which are necessary to fuel our arcane industries. However, it is also full of ponies who seek to resist our rule at every turn. Perhaps we could have our cake and eat it too if we just send those who resist us deep into our newly obtained gem-mines? At very least, it'll shut up their ceaseless complaints."
 
 NCG_integrate_mwy:0 "Dealing with the Peninsula Nobles"
 NCG_integrate_mwy_desc:0 "In order to properly rule these populous new lands, we will have to integrate the local nobility into our ranks. Many have suggested adopting a §RFeudo-Corpocracy§!, mixing New Mareway's stable but slow feudal system, with our own efficient but small corporate administration. An important step towards this will be granting the nobility official positions within our Guild. This will go a long way towards integrating our newly conquered lands."
 
 NCG_bloody_treachery:0 "Bloody Treachery"
 NCG_bloody_treachery_desc:0 "Now that Bloodmane's crew have served their purpose, there is little stopping us from making our company policy towards raiders very clear. There is no room for bloodthirsty psycopaths in our nation."
 
 NCG_bloody_enslavement:0 "J.E.B.'s Raider Rehabilitation Program"
 NCG_bloody_enslavement_desc:0 "We are a reasonable and civilized people. We respect that raiders are ponies too, no matter how bloodthirsty or vile. As a result, it would only be right for us to give them a chance to redeem themselves through hard work. Only through their blood and sweat will they become proper ponies once more."
 
 NCG_integration_skills:0 "Uniting the Realms"
 NCG_integration_skills_desc:0 "Just as New Mareway is no more, so too is Neocastle a relic left in the past. We have become something greater than a mere collection of Guilds centered around a single city. Through our hard work and effort, we have risen ever higher and become a new nation. One holding within it the best qualities of our parts. This has already happened, but now we shall make it official. Neocastle is dead. Long live Neocastle-Mareway!"
 
 NCG_enslave_bog:0 "Enslave the Bogponies"
 NCG_enslave_bog_desc:0 "The bogponies are a backwards bunch of savages. They have plentiful disease, but little else of note. Despite our disgust towards their way of life, we can't deny that we are always in need of more able bodies to facilitate our industrial expansion. At least they should be an easy target."
 
 NCG_enslave_pbn:0 "Tame the Savage Plains"
 NCG_enslave_pbn_desc:0 "The plains to the west may not have an excessive amount of resources, but they are a strategic point that could allow us to push further into the region. Therefore, it would only be reasonable for us to secure them under our control at our earliest convenience."
 
 NCG_enslave_gor:0 "Gorge Ourselves on the Gorges"
 NCG_enslave_gor_desc:0 "Gorgetown is a rather small nation bordering a minor river. This makes them an obvious target for our continued expansion, as it is unlikely that other Wasteland powers would object to us dealing with such a small country."
 
 NCG_enslave_evr:0 "Put a Leash on the Dogs"
 NCG_enslave_evr_desc:0 "The disgusting mutts that occupy the Everfree continue to be a blight on the horizon. J.E.B. can't even go to his vacation resort on the border of the Everfree without fearing the stench of their flea-ridden packs. It's long past time someone do something about that menace and finally bring the torch of civilization to the Everfree."
 
 NCG_enslave_rep:0 "Of Radishes and Republics"
 NCG_enslave_rep_desc:0 "The Republic is a relatively unimportant nation that is sitting atop a treasure trove of natural resources and fertile land. Land that will very soon be ours, to do with what we please. J.E.B. is already envisioning vast farms growing all sorts of crops, with which we can corner the food trade in the Wasteland."
 
 NCG_enslave_raf:0 "Colour Azuria Black!"
 NCG_enslave_raf_desc:0 "The Azureway stands as a natural divider between us and the southern Heartland. The time has come for us to seize control of the river's entire northern bank, securing it and by extension our territory against any who would seek to threaten us. Of course, the powers that be may be displeased by this, so we should express suitable caution."
 
 NCG_slave_finish:0 "Onwards, to New Profits!"
 NCG_slave_finish_desc:0 "It's hard to believe that just a few short years ago, J.E.B.'s dream seemed to be just that: Nothing more than the unrealistic goals of a starry-eyed corporate president with more money than sense. Now, he has turned his vision into a reality. Our lands stretch far beyond our traditional holdings, our wealth piles high enough to cover entire city blocks, and we have proven ourselves to be worthy rulers of the Equestrian Wasteland."
 
 NCG_magos_sunforge:0 "Trust in Magos Sunforge"
 NCG_magos_sunforge_desc:0 "Magos Sunforge has been a controversial figure within our Guild for a long time due to her eccentric obsession with a singular project above all others. However, her mind is undeniably brilliant and her loyalty unshakable. Perhaps she would be far more willing to work on a larger variety of projects if we were willing to finally entertain §OProject Starfury§!."
 
 NCG_black_market_tech:0 "§OHarness the Fires of the Sun§!"
 NCG_black_market_tech_desc:0 "For milennia ponykind has yearned for the stars, gazing from afar at those great focal-points of life and prosperity. Celestia herself once claimed power over the Sun, and she had the magic to back it up, but now the princesses are dead and the Sun is still moving on its own. Still, our fascination is not gone, and Magos Sunforge has quite the ambitious plan to bring the Sun to us..."
 
 NCG_precision_engineering:0 "Revive the Art of Circuit-Manufacturing"
 NCG_precision_engineering_desc:0 "We have salvaged and maintained complex circuits for generations, but actually constructing them is an art that was considered lost with the rest of the world. Fortunately, with the backing of both the Builder's Guild and Miner's Guild, we now find ourselves in a position to restore what was once lost and to start up a high-tech manufacturing industry once more."
 
 NCG_our_own_crusader_maneframe:0 "Building Our Own Maneframe"
 NCG_our_own_crusader_maneframe_desc:0 "In times long past, there existed immense terminals quite unlike any others which have ever blessed our mortal realm. The height of engineering and technology, these beasts of computing power were referred to as 'maneframes'. Though they were few in number, their contributions were no-doubt vital to the ongoing progress of Equestrian industry and science towards the end of the War. It would benefit us immensely to harness such a technological marvel for ourselves."
 
 NCG_liquidate_the_corrupt:0 "Liquidate the Corrupt, Literally."
 NCG_liquidate_the_corrupt_desc:0 "Bribery, blackmail, and even more insidious practices plague our land. It is unfortunate that we have been forced to resort to such measures ourselves in our rise to power, but now we stand in a position to do something about it. Effective immediately, any official caught accepting bribes or trading in 'favors' will be considered a traitor to their Guild and to Neocastle as a whole. The only suitable punishment for violating the loyalty clause of their contract is immediate termination of both employment and life."
 
 NCG_soylent_green:0 "Introduce §rP.A.R.S.N.I.P.§!"
 NCG_soylent_green_desc:0 "The §rPony-Adjacent Recycled-Sustenance and Nutrient-Ingestion Program§!, or PARSNIP for short, will alleviate the problems of supplying an increasingly urbanized and factory-bound population with enough sustenance to remain effective workers. It allows us to not only recycle certain types of industrial waste into foodstuffs, but also allows for the re-use of dead employee bodies to provide nutrients for the next generation!\nIt's not cannibalism if the pony is at least five steps removed from the finished product!"
 
 NCG_land_plenty:0 "A Land of Plenty"
 NCG_land_plenty_desc:0 "Our industry is booming now that corruption has been eliminated and the process of employees getting fed and trained has been 'streamlined'. We will utilize this wealth to invest into our future further, hopefully creating an exponential-growth spiral. A future of endless wealth awaits!"
 
 NCG_electric_wonders:0 "The Wonders of Network-Integration"
 NCG_electric_wonders_desc:0 "Terminals, cameras, machines, security systems, and far more can all be connected in one vast network to drastically increase our capabilities across a wide variety of fields. This has already been carried out within our own Forges, but now the time has come for us to put it to the test on a wider scale. Neocastle shall become the testing grounds for what may very well be the single greatest innovation since the end of the world. Let the information flow!"
 
 NCG_expand_network:0 "Rural Testing"
 NCG_expand_network_desc:0 "Some concerns have been raised regarding the efficiency of our network when applied to a more rural setting. Fortunately, we have no shortage of less populated land in our territory with which to use as a testing grounds for this. Each and every minor settlement will be connected into our vast network, bringing the wonders of the future to even our most remote citizens."
 
 NCG_seize_everfree:0 "Hazardous Environment Testing"
 NCG_seize_everfree_desc:0 "We are still working out the kinks, but we believe we have devised a strategy for effectively expanding our network infrastructure into a less hospitable region. The perfect testing grounds for this lie in the depths of the Everfree Forest, one of the most hostile regions in all of Equestria. First, we must seize control of a section of it for ourselves."
 
 NCG_dog_workers:0 "A Gift to the Miner's Guild"
 NCG_dog_workers_desc:0 "The Miner's Guild remains distant from us, hesitant to praise the immense progress we are making. Perhaps a gift would warm their attitude a bit. It just so happens that we now have under our control no shortage of large semi-intelligent dogs, who are greatly proficient at mining. What more could they hope for?"
 
 NCG_charcoal_woods:0 "The Everfree Charcoal Powerplant"
 NCG_charcoal_woods_desc:0 "It is now time to put our theories into practice. Firstly, we must construct an immense facility dedicated to turning charcoal into usable industry. This shall form the basis of both our network expansion and our strategy to deal with the ever-enroaching forest which resists us at every turn. If the Everfree wishes to stand against us, it shall be reduced to nothing more than fuel for our fires as our circuits stretch across the ash-ridden landscape."
 
 NCG_expand_bog:0 "Stretching Our Legs"
 NCG_expand_bog_desc:0 "As our population and industry expands, we find ourselves increasingly in need of more land to continue our efforts. The Builder's Guild believe they have identified a suitable target for our expansion, even if the landscape itself is of questionable stability. The Bog Hoppers aren't expected to put up much of a fight, making their land free real estate."
 
 NCG_resettle_bogponies:0 "Finding Capable Technicians"
 NCG_resettle_bogponies_desc:0 "Most of the ponies inhabiting Froggy Bottom Bog are in questionable state, both physically and mentally. Illiteracy rates are high, disease is rampant, and it is truly a wonder they managed to survive for so long prior to our intervention in the region. That being said, not all of them are a lost cause. We will find those who can pass a basic intelligence test and bring them back to Neocastle to be trained on how to repair and maintain machines. At least some use will be made of them."
 
 NCG_bog_productivity:0 "Subsidize Guild Expansion"
 NCG_bog_productivity_desc:0 "The Builder's Guild has been quick to try to expand into our newly conquered land, working on all sorts of projects aimed at making them profitable. However, the time scale for these projects is unacceptable. In order to speed things up, we will reallocate resources and funding towards their efforts so that they may successfully expand at some point in our lifetimes."
 
 NCG_abduct_ponies:0 "Encourage 'Non-voluntary Immigration'"
 NCG_abduct_ponies_desc:0 "Though our reach stretches beyond our traditional borders, the heart of our power remains back in Neocastle. We will 'encourage' all those who we believe to be potential trouble-makers to relocate to those lands which have already felt the embrace of our ever-expanding network. There, we can keep a very close eye on them and handle any dissent long before it becomes a problem."
 
 NCG_new_relays:0 "Consolidating Control"
 NCG_new_relays_desc:0 "With our new lands tamed and those within them firmly under our iron-hoofed control, we can finish the subjugation of them and expand our operations freely across their former lands. This is but one small step towards our ultimate goal of achieving a new future for the Equestrian Wasteland, one driven by profit and progress in equal measure."
 
 NCG_magos_ferrofall:0 "Empower Magos Ferrofall"
 NCG_magos_ferrofall_desc:0 "Magos Ferrofall is our leading expert on all things relating to pony-based assets, from how they think and react to their overall driving motives. He has proven crucial in keeping our menials operating at peak efficiency, along with providing suitable incentives for advancing through our Guild. Now, it is time to spread his influence across each of the Guilds so that all equines within our nation may be managed with utmost efficiency."
 
 NCG_ferro_cyber:0 "§RThe Secrets of Fillydelphia§!"
 NCG_ferro_cyber_desc:0 "We have substantial reason to believe that the so-called 'Cathedral' deep within the Everfree is home to the most advanced cybernetics research program in Equestrian history. Fortunately, that mighty fortress is not so impenetrable as its inhabitants would otherwise believe. A full well-placed bribes and a careful smuggling operation should be enough to get some of the information contained within into our hooves."
 
 NCG_decrypt_files:0 "Decrypt Files"
 NCG_decrypt_files_desc:0 "While we now hold cybernetics that are decades ahead of our own, the holotapes that came with them are heavily encrypted. Without the information contained on them, it will take a great deal longer to reverse-engineer this technology. To avoid having to go through this process, we will focus our efforts on breaking the encryption and getting at the valuable data stored within."
 
 NCG_project_talos:0 "Launch project §P'TALOS!§!"
 NCG_project_talos_desc:0 "Now that we have knowledge of Stable 101's cybernetics-program, we can built upon it. While their creations are impressive, they are also prohibitively expensive and seem to put an over-emphasis on aesthetic. We will design new-model cybernetics that will be easy to produce, require mostly common materiels, and simply don't care about looking 'intimidating'. Magos Ferrofall, himself already a cyberpony, has mandated his entire department undergo cyberization by the end of the year."
 
 NCG_enhance_workers:0 "Lobotomize Unproductive Workers"
 NCG_enhance_workers_desc:0 "With the department of Equine Resources cyberized, and the higher-ups of the Mechanicum Guild supportive of our endeavors, we will begin mass-lobotomies of menials failing to meet their quotas. This procedure should remove their drive to rebel or feel strong emotions in general, and make them ideal candidates to receive cybernetics as well, to improve their lacking performance. They'll have to go into company debt to pay for those cybernetics, but they won't be capable of comprehending that fact."
 
 NCG_enhance_soldiers:0 "Cyberize Company Security"
 NCG_enhance_soldiers_desc:0 "Our cyberization-program has shown great results, and although many within our country are starting to doubt the sanity of the Magi, Ferrofall is determined to spread cyberization even further! Next on his list is our security forces, who could really use some 'upgrades'. You don't need to carry a weapon if you ARE the weapon after all. Also, it will be very convenient if we are the only suppliers of life-saving cybernetics maintenance for our army, virtually guarranteeing their continued subservience."
 
 NCG_flesh_steel:0 "§FFlesh§! and §gSteel§! in §NHarmony§!"
 NCG_flesh_steel_desc:0 "As of the end of last quarter, over 10% of our entire population has some sort of cybernetic implant in their bodies. We will have to move slower from now on, as manufacturing capabilities are reaching their peak potential efficiency, and outsourcing is not an option. So instead of producing more, we will introduce a new generation of cybernetics that are much more long-term compatible (and also kill you upon removal) with organic bodies. Soon, we will be the most efficient nation in this blasted Wasteland!"
 
 NCG_smoke_steel:0 "From §AThree§! to §ROne§!"
 NCG_smoke_steel_desc:0 "The Builder's Guild is spread thin, kept busy trying to manage far more land than they have the personnel to oversee. The Miner's Guild has grown content, bloated on their newfound wealth. Both are blind to the reality of their situation. Day after day, more of their personnel become augmented. Quarter after quarter, those under their command become increasingly reliant upon us. We are the future, the only possible way forward for Neocastle and ponykind as a whole. It is time that they submit to our rule or face their ultimate demise."
 
 NCG_our_tendrils:0 "Priority: §RExpand Reach§!"
 NCG_our_tendrils_desc:0 "Now that the lesser Guilds have been dealt with, there is nopony left to object to our decrees. The first order of business will be to expand our operations outwards, as we will need a far greater deal of resources if we wish to truly bring about the future of our dreams. From east to west, all is ours for the taking."
 
 NCG_eat_mareway:0 "Objective: §GSeize Eastern Peninsula§!"
 NCG_eat_mareway_desc:0 "New Mareway has stood as a proud relic of tradition for centuries now. They see themselves as the followers of a tried and true system, a Kingdom to last for centuries more. The truth is that they are ignorant. From the most miserable peasant to the fattest noble, each and every one of them is blind to the realities of the world. They are so trapped in the past that we have little choice but to drag them into the future."
 
 NCG_find_intelectuals:0 "Amendment: §CSecure Local Intellectuals§!"
 NCG_find_intelectuals_desc:0 "Though the nobility and commoners alike may be a lost cause, there are some within this miserable feudal nation that could have their eyes open. The intellectuals, whether they be local alchemists or noble wizards, may be bright enough to see the merit of the world in which we wish to create. With time, they could even be integrated into our ranks."
 
 NCG_kill_era:0 "Amendment: §CSuppress Irregular Combatants§!"
 NCG_kill_era_desc:0 "Organized raiders on a wide scale stand as a sort of paradoxical force. How can an organized entity based on stealing, murder, and war manage to grow large enough to consider itself a nation? It boggles the mind. Unfortunately, though they are a valuable resource for sociological research, they are also an active threat to our operations. As a result, we are left with little choice but to liquidate them."
 
 NCG_amethyst_unity:0 "Conclusion: §rAmethyst Basin Pacified§!"
 NCG_amethyst_unity_desc:0 "Many sought to stand against us, from barbaric savages playing at being knights to even more barbaric raiders trying to build an empire on a mound of bodies. How foalish they were to oppose us, for the conclusion of our conflict was reached long before our first soldiers stepped foot over the flimsy excuse they called borders. Now, we stand as the last remaining force in the Amethyst Basin. As it should be."
 
 NCG_annihilate_pbn:0 "Objective: §GAnnihilate Western Threat§!"
 NCG_annihilate_pbn_desc:0 "The further west one travels, the more clear it becomes that the torch of civilization was snuffed out by balefire. Tribalistic gangs, mercenary warlords, and inhospitable hellscapes await those who dare brave those untamed lands. Most would seek to avoid that entire region as if it were a necromantic plague. Fortunately, we are not like most, and we shall instead march forward with the full intent to civilize that which has been damned."
 
 NCG_annihilate_gor:0 "Amendment:\n§CCleanse Gorges§!"
 NCG_annihilate_gor_desc:0 "Quarry eels are disgusting and dangerous creatures, leaving us baffled as to why anypony would think living around them would be a good idea. Regardless, Gorge Town stands as a monument to both ponykinds perseverance and stupidity in equal measure. They will be far safer under our benevolent rule than they currently are, liable to meet the end of their days simply because an eel is having a bad day."
 
 NCG_annihilate_fta:0 "Amendment: §CExterminate Talons§!"
 NCG_annihilate_fta_desc:0 "The Talons are often more akin to wandering warbands than anything else, moving from contract to contract with nothing more than profit on their minds. However, a few key exceptions do exist across the Wasteland. One of these groups has been held up for a long while now in an old wartime bunker, ruling over a hostile land for reasons only they know. It's long past time somepony teach these mercenaries to stick to their original profession."
 
 NCG_west_secure:0 "Conclusion: §rSummerdale Fully Subjugated§!"
 NCG_west_secure_desc:0 "The western region has been brought firmly under our control. With the ponies of that wild land subjugated, we are now free to see to the exploitation of their natural wealth. Anything of value will be secured, any able-bodied ponies will be put to work, and we will ensure that our newly conquered lands operate as efficiently as possible."
 
 NCG_fight_NCR:0 "Priority: §REliminate Azurian Menace§!"
 NCG_fight_NCR_desc:0 "The Azureway stands as a natural divide between north and south. It is an obvious border for us to hold, allowing us both a strategic defence point and greater access to a valuable trading route in the form of the river. The current inhabitants are unlikely to freely welcome our rule, but since when have we put much stock in free will?"
 
 NCG_wrap_wires:0 "§ATo Wrap the World in Wires§!"
 NCG_wrap_wires_desc:0 "Through fire and war, we have proven our ideas time and time again. Tribals and their spirits could not stand against us. The other Guilds bent to our will. All manners of society, from feudal kingdoms to representative republics, have been forced to bow to us. There is only one possible conclusion to draw. It is the fate of the world to submit to our system, to be wrapped within the tender embrace of our grand network. The future will not be one of misery, slavery, or death. The future will be one of wires."
 
 NCG_company_security:0 "Begin Rebuilding Company Security"
 NCG_company_security_desc:0 "Our security team has been sorely lacking for a long time now. This was fine back when we could pay off any hostile competitors, but due to the ever-changing conditions of modern markets, we are forced to consider investing more heavily into asset-protection."
 
 NCG_flying_survey:0 "Flying Surveillance"
 NCG_flying_survey_desc:0 "We are forced to keep our eye on many ponies, both within our own market and outside of it. Personnel and consumers alike pose a potential threat to our operations, leading to the need to constantly monitor them. Towards this end, we will invest in aircraft to maintain an eye in the sky at all times. Only in this way can we avoid being caught unawares."
 
 NCG_airport_rapids:0 "The Rapids Airport"
 NCG_airport_rapids_desc:0 "Back during the War, Azure Rapids was home to the Azureway Regional Airport. Though it has been left in disarray after two centuries of neglect, it would still be entirely possible for us to restore it to working condition with enough effort."
 
 NCG_wartime_aircraft:0 "Wartime Aircraft Manuals"
 NCG_wartime_aircraft_desc:0 "Even the Mechanicum Guild's knowledge of aircraft is lacking due to generations of inexperience. If we wish to further our knowledge of these flying machines and effective usage of them, we have little choice but to see about purchasing any manuals we can find that have survived since the fall of Equestria."
 
 NCG_sky_behemoths:0 "Airborne Compliance Enforcement"
 NCG_sky_behemoths_desc:0 "As our airborne operations continue to expand, new ideas have begun to be proposed regarding our aircraft assets. The most popular of these ideas is the concept of utilizing these assets towards aiding our ground operations through the relentless bombing of hostile competitors and disgruntled employees alike."
 
 NCG_air_standart:0 "Corporate Aircraft Standardization"
 NCG_air_standart_desc:0 "If we wish to further expand our air operations, we must devise ways to maximize production of our aircraft. Towards this end, we will invest in the development of cheap mass-produced parts for use in the construction of these flying machines."
 
 NCG_let_serve:0 "Increase Service Quotas"
 NCG_let_serve_desc:0 "Ever since the dissolution of the Security Guild, we have maintained our security personnel using a quota based system of recruitment and training. Unfortunately, these quotas have proven to not be enough to keep us competitive in the modern market. In order to improve our standing in relation to our market rivals, we must increase the quotas substantially to ensure that we have more security personnel ready to protect our assets."
 
 NCG_rely_mercs:0 "Outsource Security"
 NCG_rely_mercs_desc:0 "The truth of the matter is that we simply don't have enough personnel to maintain a large security force. Rather than forcing more employees to abandon their jobs and transfer to asset protection, we will instead invest our wealth in hiring professional third parties to see to protect our property and interests."
 
 NCG_gerwin_mercs:0 "Gerwin's Grenadiers"
 NCG_gerwin_mercs_desc:0 "The most common brand of mercenary within the Wasteland are the many different Talon organizations. One such organization operates in our local area and have proven to be reliable in the past for single-asset protection. Their leader, a griffon with an almost depraved lust for violence, would be more than happy to work for us in exchange for appropriate pay."
 
 NCG_talon_flyers:0 "Hire Dashite Instructors"
 NCG_talon_flyers_desc:0 "Dashites are a scarcity in the Wasteland, but they are far from unheard of. Indeed, our insider market-analysis teams report the presence of a sizable amount of these exiles hiding out in the bog to the north-east. It seems likely that they would be willing to work for us, provided we offer them both luxurious living conditions and protection from their former government."
 
 NCG_talon_aeris:0 "Aeris' Aeronautical Adventurers"
 NCG_talon_aeris_desc:0 "Aeris is a rather eccentric surface-born pegasus who has an obsession with aircraft. Blimps, planes, and cloudships alike are all within her domain, with her claiming to be an expert on all of them and more. With a sizable investment, her startup company could prove to be of great value to our nation."
 
 NCG_zerko_mercs:0 "Zerko's Zealots"
 NCG_zerko_mercs_desc:0 "Zerko is an odd sort, even for a zebra. It's hard to get more than a few words out of him at a time, but his band of 'legionaries' have earned a reputation for being some of the most skilled soldiers in the entire Wasteland. They won't come cheap, but the price is more than worth having such renown warriors serving our interests."
 
 NCG_duke_mercs:0 "Duke's Diggers"
 NCG_duke_mercs_desc:0 "Duke is exotic even among mercenaries, being one of the few diamond dog mercenary organizations out there. We have no doubt that his unique talents would be of great value to us. However, he demands payment in gems alone, meaning we will have to deal with the cost of importing them."
 
 NCG_rely_employ:0 "Internal Security Solutions"
 NCG_rely_employ_desc:0 "We must further expand the ranks of our security personnel if we are to ensure the safety of our assets, both domestic and within foreign markets. More personnel will be transfered into asset protection and retired personnel will be brought back into service, as instructors and officers alike."
 
 NCG_invest_weapons:0 "Invest into MEW-Research"
 NCG_invest_weapons_desc:0 "Magical Energy Weapons are among the most advanced weapons to have been designed by Wartime Equestria for single-pony usage. Investing in this technology would provide us with a substantial advantage over the competition."
 
 NCG_invest_doctrine:0 "Board-Sponsored Wargames"
 NCG_invest_doctrine_desc:0 "One thing money can't buy is actual battlefield experience for our commanders. At least not without finding a reliable supplier of pre-recorded memory orbs. Until such a provider can be found, we will instead have to rely on simulated drills to test our operational strategies."
 
 NCG_robot_gaps:0 "The Mechanical Enforcers"
 NCG_robot_gaps_desc:0 "Unlike ponies, robots do not question orders. They do not feel remose. And most importantly, they do not hesitate before putting a disorderly employee back in line. Machines are the future, within the fields of industry and security alike. It would do us well to invest in this future now, before our competitors beat us to the punch."
 
 NCG_the_new_budget:0 "Restructure the Security Budget"
 NCG_the_new_budget_desc:0 "Our security spending has been subject to endless amounts of bueracratic meddling for decades, causing their budget to be widely misappropriated. When it does actually go towards asset protection, it is often spent inefficiently and with far higher than necessary operating costs. Through an extensive audit and restructuring of our security team's financial office, we can cut back on costs considerably while ensuring that all the money spent goes towards the right place."
 
 NCG_whip_into_shape:0 "Enforce Standards of Conduct"
 NCG_whip_into_shape_desc:0 "Many of our security officers act as if they are Wasteland ruffians, with little respect for proper conduct. While we've tolerated this sort of behavior in the past, the time has come for us to put our hoof down and strictly enforce our Code of Conduct for all security personnel. No more crazed drug binges will be tolerated while on duty or within a security uniform!"
 
 NCG_best_money_equipment:0 "Heavy Infantry Weapons"
 NCG_best_money_equipment_desc:0 "There comes a time when standard guns simply won't cut it. We will invest in the development of heavier weaponry for use in those situations where excessive force becomes necessary force."
 
 NCG_focus_of_the_new_army:0 "Securing the New Age"
 NCG_focus_of_the_new_army_desc:0 "Our rivals grow stronger by the day and our assets are being increasingly threatened by our more aggressive competition. We have little choice but to pursue the further expansion of our security operations to remain competitive as we move into the future."
 
 NCG_azure_navy:0 "Fund the Neocastle Merchant-Navy"
 NCG_azure_navy_desc:0 "A sizable amount of our trade is conducted entirely through the Azureway River. As of late, our vessels on the riverway have been increasingly harassed by the many pirates operating in the region. In order to protect them and to facilitate further trade, we will seek to establish our own Merchant-Navy."
 
 NCG_navy_canou:0 "Start Small, Like a Canoe..."
 NCG_navy_canou_desc:0 "We can't just jump into having the biggest baddest ships around. First, we must refine our understanding of boat construction. Towards this end, we will begin experimenting with small vessels designed for rapid scouting."
 
 NCG_corporate_marines:0 "A Corporate Marine-Corps"
 NCG_corporate_marines_desc:0 "While our standard security officers may be invaluable in the protection of our land-based assets, they are sadly lacking when it comes to seeing to the safety of our sea-based ones. As a solution to this problem, we will invest in the training of high specialized officers meant solely for naval-based combat."
 
 NCG_hooves_deck:0 "Aquire Naval-Schematics"
 NCG_hooves_deck_desc:0 "Our ongoing expansion of naval operations has hit a wall due to difficulties in reverse-engineering more advanced naval components. In order to rectify this situation, we will engage in a targeted hiring campaign towards our competitors with the hope of hiring their top naval experts."
 
 NCG_navy_guns:0 "...Put Some Massive Guns on it..."
 NCG_navy_guns_desc:0 "Now that we've experimented a bit with ship design, our experts feel confident in beginning to direct our research towards ensuring engagement effectiveness for our vessels. The dominate line of thought for this is to put the biggest guns possible on our seacraft, so as to ensure they can take on any threat they may face while out on the water."
 
 NCG_navy_battleship:0 "...End Big, With a Battleship!"
 NCG_navy_battleship_desc:0 "We have the boats and guns alike down. Now, all that's left to do is to improve our boats and guns further, through making them bigger and even more effective. Our ships shall dwarf those of our competitors, ensuring we have a sizable advantage when it comes to naval operations."
 
 NCG_no_raiders_no_pirates:0 "No Raiders, No Pirates!"
 NCG_no_raiders_no_pirates_desc:0 "With our greatly increased naval capabilities, we have found our naval operations to be unmatched in terms of effectiveness. Pirates and competition alike fear the sight of our ships in the distance, for few can hold out for long under the roar of their cannons."
 
 NCG_focus_mobility:0 "Like §ORolling Thunder§!"
 NCG_focus_mobility_desc:0 "Our forces will advance rapidly and with a great deal of force behind them, overwhelming our opposition without giving them even the opportunity to resist. In this way, we will ensure that any threat-actors which arise are dealt with as efficiently and effectively as possible."
 
 NCG_motorize_forces:0 "New Age Caravans"
 NCG_motorize_forces_desc:0 "The days of relying on slowly-trotting brahmin to carry merchandise are coming to a close. The future lies in the development of vehicles capable of crossing vast stretches of the Wasteland within a relatively short time frame. Trade routes that once took a month to travel will be reduced to under a week or less, allowing trade to prosper. Additionally, these vehicles will be of great use in the rapid transportation of our security forces."
 
 NCG_air_land_coord:0 "Air-Land Coordination"
 NCG_air_land_coord_desc:0 "No matter how fast we move across the land, planes will always be faster. With this in mind, we will invest in the further development of airplane technology. Planes will respond first to any and all incidents, stalling threat-actors until our land-based forces can arrive."
 
 NCG_armour_support:0 "Standardize 'Collector' Class IFVs"
 NCG_armour_support_desc:0 "While civilian vehicles may work for the transportation of our security forces, the development of armored vehicles would go a long way towards maximizing their effectiveness in the field. We will invest heavily in development within this field, so as to ensure our brave officers are kept safe as they ride into battle."
 
 NCG_armour_tank:0 "Develop the 'Persuader' Tank"
 NCG_armour_tank_desc:0 "Sometimes, you just can't deal with a problem through conventional means. Bullets, lasers, and even small explosives alike may just not be enough. To solve this problem, we will create a new class of vehicle, one so powerful so as to render all but the most extensive fortifications useless against it."
 
 NCG_cas_break:0 "Project 'Enterprise'"
 NCG_cas_break_desc:0 "Air superiority is of little value if we can't do anything with it. With this in mind, some of our brightest air operation theorists have proposed a project aimed at extensively furthering the development of planes designed to rain explosives down upon our rivals."
 
 NCG_fast_as_wind:0 "Riding on the Winds of Profit"
 NCG_fast_as_wind_desc:0 "Few can hope to match our security forces response time. They arrive on-site with such speed that any potential threat-actors present can't even offer a response before they are apprehended or terminated. Finally, our assets have forces worthy of protecting them."
 
 NCG_focus_robots:0 "Like §RBurning Steel§!"
 NCG_focus_robots_desc:0 "What use is a thousand ponies when a thousand machines would do just as well in their place? An endless wave of steel and circuitry is the key to success. Any other strategy is nothing more than folly, the stubborn effort by organics to remain relevant in the field of warfare despite having long been rendered obsolete."
 
 NCG_drown_bullets:0 "Drown Them in Brass"
 NCG_drown_bullets_desc:0 "Light robots may lack the pure force behind some of the larger models, but with enough of them even the most heavily fortified positions can be overwhelmed. We will invest in the further creation of these highly mobile machines to ensure we always enjoy the advantage of numbers."
 
 NCG_repair_squad:0 "Dedicated Repair-Squads"
 NCG_repair_squad_desc:0 "Though organic forces may be largely obsolete within the realm of modern warfare, this does not mean they are entirely without purpose. Dedicated maintenance teams will ensure that our mechanical guardians remain in top shape, ensuring their continued combat effectiveness even after long-term deployment."
 
 NCG_task_robots:0 "No Rest, No Respite"
 NCG_task_robots_desc:0 "Unlike our rivals, our forces don't need to take breaks beyond for standard maintenance. They can work throughout all hours of day and night, remaining fully alert throughout their entire shift rather than growing less aware as organics tend to do. This alone proves their superiority, making them an obvious target for further investment."
 
 NCG_tech_superior:0 "Technological Superiority"
 NCG_tech_superior_desc:0 "Some ponies may dislike their role in the world being taken over by a robot, but this shouldn't be a deterent. On the contrary, it is all the more reason to pursue more advanced robots in order to further reduce the need to rely on inferior organic forces. The future is one of machines."
 
 NCG_bomb_stone_age:0 "Into the Stone Age"
 NCG_bomb_stone_age_desc:0 "Our competition will be beaten back, massacred, and defeated so badly that they are returned to a more primitive time. No matter how civilized they may believe themselves to be, our more advanced forces will put theirs to shame. We are truly the peak of ponykinds advancement."
 
 NCG_spearhead_troops:0 "The Loyalty of Machines"
 NCG_spearhead_troops_desc:0 "Ponies have second thoughts and concerns regarding the orders they are given. How can we ever trust a security officer who could turn against us at any moment, deciding that they would much rather fight for our rivals than for us? Fortunately, robots do not suffer from such doubts. They remain faithful and loyal at all times, dutifully carying out their orders with efficiency and precision. How can anypony hope to compete with the most loyal army in Equestria?"
 
 NCG_focus_defiance:0 "§FOne Thousand Citadels§!"
 NCG_focus_defiance_desc:0 "When our rivals arrive at our borders, they will find nothing but impenetrable walls to greet them. Behind these fortifications will await a force so determined to hold their position that they will not retreat until every last one of them has died. Through our stubborn refusal to bow down to any petty Wasteland army, we will become known far and wide for our security capabilities."
 
 NCG_special_explosives:0 "Invest in Specialized Explosives"
 NCG_special_explosives_desc:0 "Bullets alone won't win the day. Vast amounts of explosives, on the other hoof, might. Through the widespread deployment of explosives companies, we can ensure that our forces remain ready to deal with even the largest armies."
 
 NCG_covering_fire:0 "Maximize Bullet-Saturation"
 NCG_covering_fire_desc:0 "Single-shot slow-firing weaponry is all well and good, but they simply won't cut it for dealing with larger amounts of lightly armored infantry. For this particular threat, we will instead rely on rapid-firing weaponry capable of mowing down a large number of ponies within a short time span."
 
 NCG_expert_medics:0 "Reduce Officer Casualties"
 NCG_expert_medics_desc:0 "Nopony is allowed to die unless they are ordered to do so. Through investments in medical technology, we hope to reduce our unauthorized casualties substantially. So long as they can still hold a gun, they can still fight in the defence of our nation."
 
 NCG_clad_in_steel:0 "10-Bit Rangers"
 NCG_clad_in_steel_desc:0 "The Steel Rangers fancy themselves to be the most effective force in the Wasteland. Hiding within their power armor, they act as though they are completely invulnerable. Unfortunately for them, we have more than enough money to invest in our own power armor project. One which will allow us to field heavily armored soldiers on par with or even superior to their best."
 
 NCG_safecracker:0 "'Safecracker' Rounds"
 NCG_safecracker_desc:0 "There exists some armor too thick for standard rounds to penetrate. To address this issue, we will create heavier weapons capable of punching a hole through even the sturdiest of foes. Not even tanks will be able to withstand our fire."
 
 NCG_not_one_step_back:0 "Grind Them to Dust"
 NCG_not_one_step_back_desc:0 "Let our competition come. No matter how many their number, they will not put a single hoof on our land. Our forces will hold out until the end of time if need be, outliving any who foalishly try to breach our lines. In this way, we will ensure our long-term success."
 
 NCG_wasteland_economics:0 "Wasteland Economics"
 NCG_wasteland_economics_desc:0 "The Greater Wasteland Market is highly competitive, being filled with struggle and death in equal measure. However, where others see only strife, we see endless potential for profit! After all, ponies are much more likely to buy into our message if the only alternative is a brutal death in the wastes..."
 
 NCG_toll_roads:0 "New Toll-Roads"
 NCG_toll_roads_desc:0 "Infrastructure is important for any efficient operation, but it is also really expensive to maintain. To balance out these expenses, any newly constructed roads and railways will enjoy having toll-stations already built in."
 
 NCG_squeeze_profits:0 "Charge for the Privilege of Employment"
 NCG_squeeze_profits_desc:0 "Our employees should count themselves lucky be allowed to not only live in such a progressive nation as this one, but to also be generously given employment by the Guilds. In fact, a good way to recoup some of our expenses would be to charge said employees for the privilege of being employed by us.\nAfter all, there is no 'I' in 'money', but there is a 'con' in 'economy'."
 
 NCG_appleseed_factory:0 "The Appleseed 'Welfare'-Centre"
 NCG_appleseed_factory_desc:0 "Instead of simply terminating or detaining our criminals and maladjusted employees, we will give them a chance to prove their apologism towards the Guilds by working off their debts to society. This way, we can produce cheaper ammenities, while fostering social cohesion in our staff. Some may criticize this measure as neo-indentured servitude, but we maintain that this is just a modern form of justice."
 
 NCG_clear_out_slums:0 "Pave Over the Slums"
 NCG_clear_out_slums_desc:0 "The hovels and shanties outside the walls of our fair city are quite the eyesore, on top of also being in the way of our industrial expansion. To combat this, we will send our security forces into the slums to clear out these dysfunctional miscreants, after which the Builder's Guild can move in to pave over the illegally constructed structures. They'll find other homes... probably. If not, the Miner's Guild is always more than happy to welcome more workers into their commons houses."
 
 NCG_connect_rapids:0 "Rapids Consumer-Colony"
 NCG_connect_rapids_desc:0 "We can always use more production centres to produce the various goods that our employess can buy from us. A proposal was recently brought before us, claiming to maximize both production and consumption at the same time. To put this to the test, we will invest in the development of a 'consumer-colony' within the Azure Rapids area. This colony will be based around both producing a large quantity of goods then redistributing those same goods to the local employees at a reasonable cost, exporting the excess to be traded on other markets. In this way, we can maximize our profit potential."
 
 NCG_river_industry:0 "Sea-Trade Monopolies"
 NCG_river_industry_desc:0 "Before the zebras started raiding Equestrian convoys, maritime trade with Griffonia and Zebrica made awe-inspiring amounts of bits. With the Zebrican Empire long gone, the time has come at last to revive sea-trade.\nWith us on top, of course."
 
 NCG_open_lemondrop_factory:0 "'Aquire' Resources Through Venture Capital"
 NCG_open_lemondrop_factory_desc:0 "There are still many ruins unexploited, and many leaders gullible enough to allow us to 'lease' scavenging rights. So, we will convince them to let us scavenge there, and, once we have evacuated all valuables, we will simply vanish from their lands, never to be heard from again. The profits will be solely our own and the chumps who foalishly agreed to grant us access will be left with nothing but empty promises and crushed dreams to remember us by."
 
 NCG_underground_factories:0 "Mandatory Urbanization"
 NCG_underground_factories_desc:0 "An urbanized population is on average 53% more productive than a dispersed rural-based one. In order to fasttrack urbanization, all employees not within the Miner's Guild shall be resettled into one of our urban production centres. Not only will this clear out the countryside for further industrial development, but it will also more effectively concentrate our skilled workforce within the capital."
 
 NCG_underground_rail:0 "Expanding Downwards"
 NCG_underground_rail_desc:0 "Relocating important parts of our industry to underground caverns and tunnels will not only open new avenues of expansion, but will also make for excellent protection against airstrikes and espionage alike. While the Miner's Guild resents having to work alongside the Builder's Guild to make this project successful, they're still willing to put aside their differences if it means they'll be able to hide their assets away from prying eyes.\nOur underground operations will be a secret to almost everypony."
 
 NCG_offshore_salvage:0 "Work to Earn the Right to Die"
 NCG_offshore_salvage_desc:0 "If you boil it down to the essentials, death is only an employee on permanent absence. Frankly, death is terribly inefficient and cuts into our profit margins substantially. Therefore, all workers will receive a mandatory dose of chems thrice a week to ensure that they remain vigorous and productive for as long as possible. A positive side-effect is that should a worker quit working for whatever reason, they will also forfeit their chem-benefits. We expect that the withdrawal will kill them soon thereafter, allowing us to charge any mourners for their funeral costs!"
 
 NCG_open_sylhpon_factory:0 "§rProject Sylphon§!"
 NCG_open_sylhpon_factory_desc:0 "We always strive to take every opportunity to hone the technological edge we have over our competitors. Recently, we were approached by a group of researches from Rock City who had to flee their home region for supposed 'crimes against equinekind'. We have offered them a new home to continue their research, provided they agree to grant us full rights to use their research however we see fit.\n§rExperimenting on living ponies for fun and profit!§!"
 
 NCG_capitalist_paradise:0 "A Corporatist Paradise"
 NCG_capitalist_paradise_desc:0 "When you look across the Wasteland, what do you see? Misery, suffering, and horrific conditions the likes of which nopony would ever wish to subject upon even their most hated enemies. Yet here, within the confines of Neocastle, you will find nothing but prosperity and progress the likes of which haven't been seen since the days of Equestria itself. Socially, culturally, and economically, we far outdo our competition. Thanks to the hard work of the Guilds, ours will be a future of prosperity and luxury. So long as everypony continues to do their part to make that future a reality."
 
 NCG_war_profiteering:0 "War Profiteering"
 NCG_war_profiteering_desc:0 "War is a racket and a profitable one at that. So long as there exists two ponies seeking to kill eachother, there will also exist the opportunity for money to be made. Through the combined efforts of each Guild, we will break into this market and reach formerly unheard of levels of profit."
 
 NCG_amethyst_plan:0 "The 'Amethyst' Plan"
 NCG_amethyst_plan_desc:0 "The Amethyst Plan, named after the gem which was once common throughout this region, calls for us to invest heavily in the expansion of our general industrial base first and foremost. Though this initially seems counterproductive towards the goal of further developing a domestic arms industry, the supporters of this plan argue that it would provide us with a better foundation on top of which we may build as many munitions plants as we can count."
 
 NCG_apiary_plan:0 "The 'Apiary' Scheme"
 NCG_apiary_plan_desc:0 "The Apiary Scheme was proposed by an unusual mix of the brightest minds within the Miner's and Mechanicum Guilds alike. It calls for us to create semi-isolated 'forge communities' on the outskirts of Neocastle, dedicating them entirely to the production of military equipment and weapons. The workers here will live and die within their factories, laboring tireslessy to provide the means for both the defence of their country and for the expansion of the private arms market."
 
 NCG_neighbour_weapons:0 "Merchants of Death"
 NCG_neighbour_weapons_desc:0 "Now that we have a greater industrial base to build off of, it is time to engage in a bit of advertising to let the rest of the Wasteland know of our new products. Great guns at great prices, provided to you by the hard-working ponies of Neocastle. Buy a hundred for ten free, in a deal so great it'll have you coming back for more! Terms and conditions may apply."
 
 NCG_poach_researchers:0 "Talent Poaching"
 NCG_poach_researchers_desc:0 "In recent years, many of the top researchers working within the Greater Wasteland Market have been grabbed up by Red Eye through his immense wealth and resources. Now, it is our turn to follow in his hoofsteps by offering a life of luxury to any innovative minds who are willing to work for the betterment of ponykind. After all, progress and profit go hoof in hoof."
 
 NCG_predatory_lending:0 "Nation-Scale Predatory Lending"
 NCG_predatory_lending_desc:0 "There's profit to be had within the realm of money lending. Now that we have the means to enforce our debt collection within the Greater Wasteland Market, we have little reason to not be generous with our foreign investments. Of course, these investments will have to be paid back, plus a non-insubstantial amount of interest, producing a net gain of revenue for us. When our new debtors inevitably can't afford to pay back what they owe, their assets will be seized and put to use to produce profit directly."
 
 NCG_capitalism_marches_on:0 "§aThe Final Form of Capitalism§!"
 NCG_capitalism_marches_on_desc:0 "We have achieved the goal of our forefathers, that pursuit which our nation has been wholely dedicated to for so long: The achievement of peak profit. Though many considered it to have been nothing more than a myth, we have shown it to be a reality. Money, money, and more money as far as the eye can see. Nopony, nogriff, and certainly nozeeb has ever come even close to holding the sheer amount of wealth we now have at our disposal. Truly, we have perfected the art of the deal."

 NCG_mil_invest_5:0 "An Army of Machines"
 NCG_mil_invest_5_desc:0 "Tales are told in hushed whispers around campfires of the machine-army of Neocastle. It is said that they are entirely unfeeling constructs of metal and circuitry, capable of shooting lasers out of their eyes and crushing a ponies spine with but a flick of their robotic hooves. These stories aren't far off, as our robotic forces have proven themselves more than capable of taking on even the toughest ponies. Moving forward, they will likely be crucial to securing our assets across the Wasteland."
 NCG_civ_invest_5:0 "The Magic of Capitalism"
 NCG_civ_invest_5_desc:0 "Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria, there lived three great Guilds. Each of them, noble and proud, sought to pursue what really matters: Profit.

 NCG_corruption_modifier_desc:0 "It is said that within the lands of Neocastle, money can buy anything. This includes the favor of the upper-ranking members within each Guild, who are willing to do all sorts of favors for those with enough gifts to grease the gears. Of course, this generosity also commonly extends to the friends and families of those holding such ranks as well.\n\nWhile these sorts of arrangements have persisted since the days of Equestria itself, they are considered by many to be far from desirable. If we aren't careful, this corruption could begin to have a severe impact on our business operations."
 NCG_indentured_servants:0 "Indentured Employees"
 NCG_indentured_servants_desc:0 "In the early days of our nation, it was not uncommon for ponies to end up deeply indebted to the Guilds. Many of these ponies were then unable to pay their dues. However, we are not the sorts of monsters who would break their kneecaps and demand immediate payment. Instead, in our benevolence, we offered a solution that could allow them to work away their debt. This created a large supply of low-skilled personnel, which quickly became the backbone of our corporate expansion.\n\nThe descendants of many of these ponies are still indentured to us today, working hard to pay off the debts held by their lineage. Some call it slavery, but with enough hard work and effort, anypony can purchase their freedom once more."

The Security Guild was completely disolved and all of their assets were distributed among the other Guilds.\n\nDue to this dark stain in our history, our security officers are kept as a relatively small force with little funding.

Nothing will stop them until that future has been made into a reality."

 neocastlegui.1.d:0 "Here in the blasted heart of the wasteland, we have achieved a truly incredible thing. Out progress and research have truly borne fruit. In this way, there appears to be, without any shred of doubt, a true vindication of the effect of our innovative nature. Our corporate labs and R&D efforts had been more than satisfactory in this regard. We can only hope that through the proper application of those new ideas and concepts, we can further strengthen and consolidate our industrial capabilities thorugh those wonderful technologies that will be perfected and refined. \n\nOur have made breakthroughs in the industry will lead us to a much more profitable future!"

 neocastlegui.2.t:0 "A Rifle From Another Age"
 neocastlegui.2.d:0 "It was an incidental thing, nothing more than the hobbyist project of a Technician within the Mechanicum. Indeed, if it were not for this Technician running late to their shift, it would have gone entirely unnoticed. This incident, along with their suspicious behavior when questioned as to why they were so late, was what then sparked an internal investigation into the errant employee's unbecoming behavior. An investigation which quickly escalated into sending security forces into their quarters to find out what was so important to them that they would dare be late in performing their obligations to their Guild.\n\nThis investigation quickly found the topic of their obsession: A homemade rifle, seemingly entirely unique in design. The initial reaction was as severe as it was swift, with the Technician in question being quickly sentenced to becoming fuel for the many carbon-extractors used as one of the many sources of power for the immense facility known as the Alpha Forge. In an unusual turn of events though, this move was quickly overturned by one of our respected and revered Engineers, who proclaimed the lowly Technicians work to be a 'marvel of innovation'.\n\nFollowing this, the case and the weapon that came from it was quickly brought up to an interested Magos. After some study and deliberation, it was decreed that this Technician had truly been blessed, and was to not just be fully reinstated, but immediately promoted to the rank of Engineer. As for the weapon itself, it was quickly reverse engineered, catalogued, and sent to a team of the Mechanicum's brightest for further study."

 neocastlegui.3.t:0 "Energy from the Void"
 neocastlegui.3.d:0 "Our Scientists are not quite sure how they managed it, but a random accident while testing a new form of magical-energy reactor has caused it to output power... even while there is no Magical gem inserted.\nFrom the scarce reading we can get from the outside, it seems like the reactor has tapped into some fundamental force of the universe, as, according to the readings, its not that the reactor-chamber is empty, but that it contains negative space. Our current theory is that this negative space was created due to a misapplication of multiple power-gems in a circuit, and that it by all rights should have blown up the entire tower. However, as the universe abhorrs negativity, it seems that energy is spontaneously manifesting within the reactor, in a universal effort to restore equilibrium, only to be syphoned off by our machine, to be used by us.\nThe Scientist responsible for the mistake that created this has been reprimanded for it, and was afterwards promoted to head his own research team.\nThis could very well be a clean energy source for the future, once we understand how to properly re-create it."

 neocastlegui.4.t:0 "The Restoration-Potion(TM)"
 neocastlegui.4.d:0 "The various Guilds of Neocastle aren't known for being biologists. We are masters of machinery, not fickle things like a pony's bodily functions! However, there are a few who seek to understand and innovate within the realm of flesh. Recently, these individuals have concocted a new and improved healing potion of sorts. The potion's creators have made ecstatic claims to investors, stating its supposed ability to bring the most tired labourers of the mines, or even the seemingly failed test subjects of the Mechanicum, back from the brink! Great promises of high regeneration and full rejuvenation of body and spirit were met with deaf ears however, as the idea was soon scrapped and began trading hands.\n\nAfter some time, and substantial trading of large quantities of favors, assets, and other funds, an enthusiastic member of the Mechanicum resurfaced the project. There were several test trials, many of which concluded with applicants becoming deformed and disturbing. Some subjects were found sagging horrendously with three times the skin. Others gained much larger blood vessels which couldn't be filled by their miniscule hearts. Many more simply grew too much flesh to move effectively, or POPPED, leaving a mess for the janitors. But science inevitably prevailed! We have developed the first... net positive iteration of this potion! Furthermore, after some rather foalish names, the likes of "Flesh Fixer Fantastic(TM)!'' or "Better Built Best Bodies©!", we have reached a final marketable brand.\n\nSo are you feeling worn out? Is your poor old body not working the way it used to? Perhaps a freak machinery accident cut off more than just a bit of your hoof? Or do you want to make sure you get the most out of your hard working and esteemed employees? Well go and get some of Neocastle's most spectacular Restoration Potion™! With one sip you can get anypony into peak condition! Check with your local doctor to see if our Restoration Potion™ is right for you!\n\n*Conditions such as rapid gain or loss of hair, skin, pigmentation, muscles, bones, a face, vital organs or limbs may occur. The producers of Restoration Potion(TM) are not to be held accountable, under any circumstances, for side effects of this product.*"

The new Invention utilizes the inherent radiation of the wood, by causing a process of cascading mutations within the material that forces the cells to harden their membranes into a kind of bio-plstic, causing them to expend all of their energy and dying off once the process is complete. While it is not nearly as smooth and flawless as regular Plastics, our new version is easily producable given our location, and any flaws it does have can be worked around by our engineers."

Capacitors crackle with energy, as new modulators, plasma-excitors, AI-matrixes and more are being produced by our capable staff using these machines to their fullest. The Trade Council has hailed this as a great success, and one a big step towards restoring Wartime profits to the Guilds. Sadly, we are unable to reblicate many of the machines for now, as we still need the "template" provided by the wartime equipment, though our Scientists are confident that those too can be reverse-engineered in time."

However it quickly became apparent that something more was going on after the technician charged with listening to all the tapes for cataloging purposes was notably happy and open to suggestion. This led to the discovery that the tapes weren’t just any ordinary recorded broadcast, but were in fact filled with subliminal messages about respecting authority and remaining calm and content at all times. Further testing indicated that playing these tapes as workers went about their day increased productivity and decreased informal complaints about working conditions and their superiors!

With a new comprehensive guide-book for field commanders already being written, it should be a relatively easy task to train some of our soldiers in this foreign method of Warfare. The Great War has proven time and time again that Zebrican tactics were extremely effective in depleting the nemies morale, while remaining supremely organized themselves. This new method of training our own legions will give us a significant advantage when fighting the untrained Peasant hordes of new Mareway, and may even allow us to stand against the Professional Talons of RedEye's.\n\nThe Armed forces of the Guilds will rule the Battlefield!"

 neocastlegui.10.d:0 "Silence fell across the gathered crowd as two ponies stepped up onto stage, all attention within the room being directed to those that had called them there to begin with. One of them, a mare dressed in the standard Equestrian-style suit that was so common among the upper ranks of the Builder's Guild, was the first to speak.\n\n'Welcome, everypony! Welcome to the future! Let me begin by asking you about the flaws of fielding a standing army: Is it their need for sleep? The struggle of supplying and feeding each soldier? The always short-line of new recruits, even with a strict reassignment policy? All of the above! That is why we, in conjunction with our partners at the Mechanicum Guild, have been hard at work creating a new type of soldier. One that does not tire, does not rest, does not need to be fed, and can be churned out as quickly as our factories can produce. I present to you all... the soldier of the future!'\n\nWith that, the stallion next to her lifted his hoof to reveal a leg-mounted device, vaguely resembling Stable-Tec's infamous Pip-Bucks. With the boop of a button, orders were remotely sent out, and a moment later a procession began as a small army of equine-robots ascended onto stage.\n\n'Gaze now at the splendor of these artificial protectors! Each one of them has been reinforced with the recently devised lunarite alloys, ensuring near-total protection against arms fire. They each pack enough power to crush even a hellhound to dust beneath their metal hooves! And even better, every one of them comes with a built in proprietary NewLens(C) SuperBeam(TM) arcane laser, capable of vaporizing any foe! Each and every unit here has a life-time of 203 years* before needing to be recharged, allowing them to outfight any foe they may come across! Not a single rival will be able to stand against us with even a sizable army of these state-of-the-art machine-soldiers.'\n\n'However, we can't do it without you. These aren't cheap, though we assure you that the investment is well worth it, and that is why we are asking those of you gathered to help us in this endeavor. What are a few bits when put next to our future? Thank you for watching this presentation. I and my partner here will be answering any questions you may have about these feats of engineering, and a live demonstration of their combat ability will be held in the field outside in an hour's time. By the end of the day, we hope that you will have seen for yourselves the potential that this technology holds to revolutionize warfare as we know it.'"

 neocastle.1.t:0 "War Profiteering"
 neocastle.1.d:0 "Most look back upon the Great War as a tragedy, the event which plunged the world into the apocalyptic nightmare that it is today. However, this viewpoint is rare among the ponies of the Neocastle Guilds. Rather than being a time of strife, that period is seen as being a time of opportunity instead. It is no secret that the Guilds, though they weren't called such yet, profited immensely from the conflict.\n\nThe Builder's Guild enthusiastically tells everypony willing to listen that they once built vast military bases and a great many bunkers all across the nation for the Equestrian government. They even claim to have been directly involved in the construction of a number of megaspell chambers, some of the most complicated and intricate structures ever designed by ponykind. They claim that the majority of these works still stand to this day, as irrefutable evidence of the quality of their workmanship.\n\nThe Miner's Guild often scoffs at these supposed accomplishments, instead pointing to their own work as being far more impressive. They controlled the majority of Equestria's mines, lumberyards, and even rock farms, providing the nation with all of the materials necessary to fuel the war effort. They even go so far as to boast that the entire War depended upon them.\n\nUnlike the other two, the Mechanicum Guild is far more reserved in regards to their accomplishments during the War. They scarcely speak of what they did, and never to those outside of their Guild, but rumors persist that they were involved in all manner of highly classified projects.\n\nWhile all three Guilds prospered off of the conflict, the Equestrian government began to tighten their finances more in the latest stages of the War. When the flow of seemingly endless bits began to dry up, the Guilds all sent representatives to Her Majesty's Night Court to petition her for greater funding, but only one of them secured her favor."

 neocastle.2.d:0 "When the end of the world came, we were not left entirely unprepared. The Guilds had prepared for the War to end in balefire, preparing a number of shelters all across the country to hide away company personnel and assets in. Many of the ponies in the upper levels of the Guilds today owe their existence entirely to these bunkers, as their ancestors only survived thanks to them. However, it seems that we were among the few fortunate enough to have enjoyed such success. Contact with all of the other shelters was lost and the lack of efforts by them to communicate with the Guilds has led to them being presumed destroyed.\n\nWhen our ancestors were building the bunkers, there was some debate over what they should focus on saving. Some argued that mid-level employees should be allowed in as well, both as a reward for their commitment to their companies and so as to ensure that they had a workforce to aid them when the time came to emerge and reconstruct the world. Others argued for them to be stocked with a large supply of valuables, so as to provide a trading good in the early days of the Wasteland. Yet a small select few instead called for these bunkers to hold within them the most advanced technology that money could afford. It is believed that they hoped to establish themselves as Gods to ignorant tribals, though the lack of tribals in the local area thwarted that plan entirely.\n\nAfter a great deal of arguing and bickering, it was decided to prioritize the preservation of..."

In those days, our competitors were many and our future was entirely uncertain. In order to survive, we had to see to internal restructuring and come up with a new operations strategy in order to maximize company potential while minimizing future risks. That is to say, we had to come up with a way to beat out our competitors while staying out of the line of fire. In order to achieve these, three plans were brought forward.\n\nThe first plan that was proposed was to simply ensure that our employees enjoyed a living standard far above those of our competitors. This would not only ensure greater productivity, but would have a demoralizing effect upon our rivals personnel. This plan enjoyed widespread support, especially among the employees themselves.\n\nThe second proposal was to invest heavily into marketing, both to consumer markets and within our company itself. With a widespread campaign, it was believed that we could foster a brand identity that could instil loyalty within the marketing targets, ensuring a lasting commitment towards our company.\n\nThe final proposal was to entirely do away with much of the corporate bureaucracy that plagued our company, as it was little more than an outdated relic from a time when we were subject to the rule of law. Without petty concerns such as 'legal compliance' or 'dues to the Crown' in the new world, we could be rid of all of that nonsense and focus on streamlining our company to ensure maximum efficiency.\n\nEventually, one plan won out over the others. And none too soon, for one of our competitors was growing especially threatening. The proposal which ended up being our key to success was..."

 neocastle.4.d:0 "In a tradition predating even the formation of the Trade Council, the highest levels of management within each Guild gather once every four years to discuss our nation's operational strategy moving forward. There are few restrictions on what can be proposed during these meetings, resulting in them often being used as a method to increase the power and influence of those participating. Over the last few board meetings, there has been an invested effort by each Guild to muster enough support to declare one of them to be the official figurehead for the nation, rather than the Trade Council. Though nopony has managed to muster enough support to pull this off yet, they have been pulling all of their strings and calling upon every favor owed to them over the last few years in the hope of finally achieving enough votes to secure a majority.\n\nOne example of their fierce competition for influence can be found in the argument over who will be hosting the upcomming meeting. Through a mix of bribes, backroom deals, and direct intimidation, they have all sought to gain the favor of the Trade Council in order to be selected as this years host.\n\nEach Guild knows full well that whoever does hoof the bill will also gain a considerable amount of prestiege, along with forcing the other members of upper management into their turf and opening up plenty of opportunities to make discrete deals with the ponies casting the votes. With this in mind, their cutthroat strategies have only ramped up further leading up to the quadrennial meeting. However, only one Guild's efforts would pay off in the end..."

 neocastle.5.t:0 "A Cap for a Bit"
 neocastle.5.d:0 "Though most topics of discussion among the Board centered around money, one topic in particular was unique in that it related directly to the monetary policy of the Guilds. Even more unusual was the pony to bring up this discussion, Archmagos Tezla herself. It was well known that the Mechanicum was far less profit-oriented than their peers, seeing profit as nothing more than a means towards an end rather than the end itself. In hushed whispers, many of the respectable enterprising ponies of Neocastle spoke of them in less than flattering terms, calling them 'uncapitalistic', among many worse things. So it was then a great surprise when their respected leader called for the Board to examine the nation's policy on caps as a medium of trade.\n\nHer points were many and hoof-picked to appeal to those present. Caps were unbacked, making them volatile and risky. Something the Builder's Guild could see hurting their profit-margins in the long term. On top of that, they were also subject to market manipulations from their competitors. The situation down in Old Appleloosa was evidence enough of this. Such an argument was quick to appeal to the more paranoid members of the Miner's Guild, always concerned with retaining their independence. Finally, the reason for her having brought this up to begin with, it took away from their own authority. So long as ponies could gather wealth from external sources, they could escape the control of the Guilds.\n\nThough many present nodded in agreement to her points, Brick and J.E.B., in a rare show of agreement, began issuing counter points. While the currency may be volatile, it was also near universally accepted, making it a necessity for further economic growth. External factors could damage the cap, certainly, but could they not also leverage it against their rivals in much the same way? As for controlling the ponies of Neocastle, that was already accomplished well enough by providing them with both meaningful work and a steady supply of consumer goods. What more could they need?\n\nThis started a fresh series of debates and conversations among those gathered. It would take them quite a while to reach a conclusion, but when they did, it was firmly in favor of..."

 neocastle.6.t:0 "Threats and Opportunities"
 neocastle.6.d:0 "One matter of great concern among many within the Guilds was the industrial powerhouse to the north. Though little was known about this 'Red Eye' character who had forged them, the industrial might wielded by the restored city of Fillydelphia was nothing short of awe-inspiring. The sheer amount of factories, ponypower, and resources at the disposal of whomever controlled that smog-blanketed city was enough to strike envy in the hearts of many of those present. It was of no surprise to anypony when this topic was brought up, as none were sure what policy the Guilds should take towards one of their largest competitors moving forward.\n\nAfter a considerable amount of discussion, it was Brick who declared that we must begin preparing for an inevitable conflict immediately. While he was all for maintaining the illusion of friendly relations with [EYE.GetLeader], it would not do at all to allow such a large competitor to remain so. Sooner or later, the time would come when this rival would come for them as well, and it was far better they be ready for them when they do.\n\nJ.E.B., who had been unusually quiet thus far, pondered for a bit longer before surprising everypony with a far more cooperative proposal. Rather than try to actively work against this competitor, a move that he assured the rest of the Board would only result in their definite invasion, it would be far preferable to stay on their goodside and so to avoid conflict for as long as possible. After all, they wouldn't be prepared to undertake a massive aggressive market expansion anytime soon, especially against such a superior force.\n\nArchmagos Tezla and her flock dismissed both proposals outright, claiming that their projections showed that their northern competitor wasn't long for this world. Pointing to a variety of factors from internal instability to multiple powerful competitors, they offered reassurance that Neocastle stood on far more stable ground and was at far less risk in the long run. Of course, this wasn't anywhere near enough to disuade Brick nor J.E.B., but it did get some of the less stubborn-headed ponies present thinking.\n\nIn the end, it was decided to..."

 neocastle.7.t:0 "Are Employees People?"
 neocastle.7.d:0 "In an unexpected interjection while discussing personnel management strategies moving forward, Brick Bobcat unveiled a plan to completely change the way in which we categorize equine personnel. He argues that his plan, which includes radical changes such as ensuring that official wages are provided and cracking down on workplace abuses, would go a long way towards improving the happiness of our employees. According to studies conducted by the Builder's Guilds' own Department of Research and Development, this increased quality of living would directly translate into increased spending at Guild stores and improved productivity. Despite these supposedly sound conclusions, the idea of granting 'token rights' to our personnel was still a highly controversial one.\n\nThe most immediate response to this drastic policy shift was from J.E.B., who was quick to completely dismiss the motion as a pointless risk to their profit-margins. He went on to claim that the very concept of 'pony rights' which Brick sought to grant to our personnel was nothing more than Unionist propaganda meant to provide an intellectual basis for their destructive policies. The implied accusation of Unionist sympathies quickly riled up Brick, who claimed that this plan would remove all legitimacy from the Unions rather than empowering them.\n\nIt wasn't until the other two stallions had calmed down that Tezla spoke, stating that the Mechanicum Guild would not support these policies in the slightest until they had been given an opportunity to conduct their own study into the matter. A study which would need at least another two decades to have conclusive results. With this declaration, the other gathered Magos were quick to throw their support behind her, making their stance clear. After a considerable amount of further debate, the votes were finally cast, and it was decided to..."

 neocastle.8.d:0 ""As is customary for these meetings, the Builder's Guild has once again proposed an internal restructuring strategy aimed towards reducing pony-based inefficiencies within our operations. Brick Bobcat's presentation on this topic, which included poorly drawing a variety of diagrams on a chalkboard to emphasize his points, went on for a number of hours. Before Brick could get properly worked up over this interpreted insult, Tezla interjected to voice her full support for his plan. According to her, the equine factor has always been the single most harmful factor in the financial reports of every Guild, and must be compensated for in any way possible.\n\nThe Miner's Guild, revealing themselves to have been more aware than what they appeared to be, remained largely unconvinced. Many of them, including J.E.B. himself, had garnered a reputation for taking bribes and granting appointments to the highest bidder. Under the strategy being proposed, these sorts of activities would be cracked down upon and strict policies of conduct would be enforced across all three Guilds. Even if this did improve the overall profit-margins, it certainly would put a damper on their own personal income.\n\nThe always unanimous support of the Mechanicum Guild would usually be more than enough to skew this vote in favor of Brick, if it were not for a large number of bribes placed earlier that day. The only question that remained was if this proposal would be defeated by the very practice which it sought to eliminate."

Though there had been some disagreements here or there, there was nothing serious enough to get fired up over. Unfortunately, this couldn't last. With the sound of a hoof slam onto the table, Brick was interrupted mid-speech by J.E.B., who was quick to follow up with a vocal objection to the CEO's latest proposal.\n\nThe proposal in question was to further expand into the private arms market, providing even more weapons for any interested parties who could afford them. Though it had initially seemed like a sound field to expand to, the mining magnate himself tore into it with harsh criticism, pointing out that we could barely supply our own security forces and that the Guilds would essentially be selling their own nooses. Murmurs of agreement soon spread across those gathered, his fire and brimstone rhetoric being more than enough to win them over.\n\nBefore he could completely lose them, Brick began waving away all of his concerns and calling that nothing but foalish alarmism. In his words, 'who would invade us when we're the ones supplying them with all their guns?'\n\nFor her part, the Archmagos simply stood impassive and offered nothing to the argument. The Mechanicum Guild had never been concerned about the arms industry and that wasn't likely to change anytime soon."

It fell to the ever authoritative CEO Brick Bobcat to first acknowledge the dragon within the room, calling upon those gathered to address a very important question regarding the future of their nation: 'Who should lead us moving forward, and why should it be me?'\n\nOf course, this was immediately met with a string of insults and objections from J.E.B., who went off on an awe-inspiring tirade against the Builder's Guild leader. By the end of his ten minute long angry rant, which included labeling his rival all manner of things from 'arrogant emptyheaded paperpusher' to things that were best left stricken from the official record, he finally collapsed back onto his haunches with visible exhaustion. Of course, with the floor once again free, it was only natural for the target of his vitriol to stand up and launch into a counter tirade.\n\nThis continued in a cycle for well over an hour, with the most loyal cronies of both sides occasionally joining in with their own creative insults towards the opposing Guild. During it all, Archmagos Tezla stood as impassive as either. Indeed, when she did stand up during a short lull in the debacle, it took a moment for most of those present to notice that she had taken the floor at all. Admonishing both of her equals as acting extremely foalish with this tremendous display of school-yard insults, her sharp criticism towards the conduct of those present made many ponies look down in shame for having acted so in such a professional environment. Of course, they immediately fired up once more when she concluded by claiming that this showed that only the Mechanicum could be trusted to guide their nation into the future, starting up debate once more.\n\nOf course, the truth of the matter was that the decision had already been made long before this argument began. None of those gathered had been idle during the free time afforded to them, with many bribes trading hooves and many promises being made. These backroom deals would be what carried the day, with the final vote being tallied and the result declaring the definite leader of the nation as a whole to be..."

While our merchants spend enough money in their backwards country to make even Red Eye blush, they have also been busy purchasing every bit of land that the locals were willing to part with. Which, it turns out, is quite a lot. Despite being savage tribals, the bog-lurking ponies were very quick to jump on the opportunity to become filthy rich.\n\nTo make matters even better, the various chieftans and shamans have proven themselves to be just as easy to buy as those who follow them. With their open declarations of support for our endeavors, only the most hot-headed and independent warriors would dare speak out against us. Their nation is effectively ours, as we are able to act with full impunity within their borders. Though they shall retain some semblance of their independence on paper, there is no doubt that they have been firmly rendered a subsidiary."

 neocastle.12.t:0 "Neocastle's Proposal"
 neocastle.12.d:0 "An envoy arrived within our fair lands today, hailing from the eastern merchant-state of Neocastle. The Guilds, true to the spirit of profit which they embody, have come to us with a proposal to facilitate increased trade between our two nations. Many of our more influential ponies, especially those of a mercantile background, have expressed a great degree of concern regarding this deal. Their warnings are extensive and dire in equal measure, though a critical eye would find them to be from a position of one who would be harmed by increased competition within the economy.\n\nSo it falls to us to determine which course of action to follow. Do we embrace these merchants and the products in which they bring, or do we reject their deal in order to protect our own traders?"
 neocastle.12.a:0 "A great idea!"
 neocastle.12.b:0 "Keep them out of our market."
 
 neocastle.13.t:0 "New Mareway Accepts!"
 neocastle.13.d:0 "As expected, [MWY.GetLeader] has accepted our mutually beneficial trade deal.\nWith this initial hurdle out of the way, not only can our nations profit from eachother, but the Guilds now have a questionably legal way to influence New Mareway's politics by leverging our wealth. Though we likely could have gotten away with this anyways, it now should be a foals task to make any of our questionable investments seem like nothing more than a bit of legitimate trading."

 neocastle.14.t:0 "New Mareway Rejects!"
 neocastle.14.d:0 "In an unexpected move, New Mareway has actually rejected our negotiations outright. Our merchants were quickly thrown out of their nation and reports claim that they are now taking measures to further distance their economy from our own. Did they see through our long-term scheme, or are they simply far too busy playing a game of court and knights to see the value in our deal? It's hard to tell, but either way, we will not be so easily detered. If they don't wish to do things the easy way, we are left with little choice but to take more drastic measures."

That is to say, they are offering to sell their entire nation to any interested buyer. In exchange for more than enough for every one of their ranking Guild members to live out the remainder of their lives in decadent luxury, along with an agreement to allow them to continue to operate private businesses within our nation, they will completely submit themselves to our authority. Though this would certainly put a strain on our own finances, it could potentially be a massive boon to us in the long-run. We should also keep in mind that if we reject this deal, another nation may accept it instead."

Many of our own slavers seem involved in the treachery, having been generously bribed by the Guilds, with only a few of them returning to our lands with the news. Neocastle has already sent envoys to the Cathedral, calling the move a 'Management-Necessity' and promise to make the loss up to us with preferential treatment in trade. The Southeast Everfree wasn't a particularly valuable territory, but maybe we should still avenge such a betrayal?"

As a result, it was a great surprise when they approached us with an offer that didn't involve paying tribute. It was an even greater surprise when they wanted to actually forge an alliance of sorts against what they call a common enemy.\n\nIt seems that the Guilds of Neocastle are just as invested in the destruction of Mareway as we are. For whatever reason, they seek to topple the Kingdom and deal with their greatest competition in the area. In exchange for our aid in this, they promise us all of the lands beyond the central Amethyst Basin, leaving us with the far better side of this deal. To butter us up even further, they are offering their expertise to improve our combat effectiveness.\n\nIt is a deal that is far too good to be true. So now the question we need to ask is: Do we trust the merchants to hold up their end of the bargain, or will they simply turn on us and steal victory from our grasp?"
 neocastle.17.a:0 "Mareway won't know what hit them."

As per our offer to them, we have already sent a caravan loaded with a variety of schematics and staffed with several of our top technical experts to assist them in modernizing their forces. As a pleasant addition to our deal, and perhaps to keep an eye on us, [ERA.GetLeader] has also sent several 'military advisors' our way, though they are hardly what we would consider proper military professionals. Despite being disorderly and prone to getting into hoof fights, they still have a surprising amount of valuable insight into the art of combat, making them a valuable addition to our own security forces."

After a long and, from how they tell it, eventful journey, they managed to arrive safely back in our borders. Though they carried with them no formal reply, their treatment at the hooves of [ERA.GetLeader] is more than enough for us to figure out their answer.\n\nOf course, this presents a new risk for us moving forward. When the time comes to topple Mareway, we may find ourselves being flanked and struck by the raiders at the same time. It would do us well to be prepared for that worst case scenario."

New Mareway on the other hoof is not only more than twice as large, but also houses the pre-existing administration of Mareway, already well versed in administrating a large and rebellious realm. Moving our Capital would also make a clear statement to all the Nobles of Mareway, that we are the new, legitimate rulers and are willing to work in the pre-existing Framework.\nIn the end, this choice won't break our Nation, but has great symbolic value."

Additionally, high-ranking Company members were awarded Noble Titles, and all Serf officially made into Employees.\nWith this momentous step, A new Wasteland Power is born, poised to strike at the soft underbelly of RedEyes Empire, or maybe turn its eyes towards the fertile soils of Azuria?\n But before any of that, now is the time to §rP§OA§RR§GT§BY§!§!§!§!§!!"

Under the watchful eyes of Corporate security and the Magos herself, one half of them were excavating a massive pit, to later be filled with the installation itself, as most of it would need to be located underground. The other half were digging the canal to the Azureway, which would both be used to ferry materials to the construction site, as well as provide the large amounts of water neccessary to cool the Foundry once it came online.\n\nStill, this was only the first step: Materials would need to be imported and the structure itself built. Then there was still the not insignificant matter of constructing the internal workings of the Foundry itself, as well as radiation-shields to prevent the entire region from becoming even more of a wasteland that it already is. And, last but not least, the Foundry would need a massive amount of energy to kickstart the process, more than the Guilds were producing now by an order of magnitude.\nBut we will overcome all these obstacles, and then we'll make history!"

While the site looks like a nondescript concrete building, only two stories tall, from the outside, it extends a further six stories underground to what soon will be the heart of the foundry itself. Corridors of smooth concrete and cold steel connect mostly empty rooms, as the installation still needs to be outfitted with the wide variety  of High-tech instruments the Magos requested.\nThe fifth and sixth stories below-ground will house the portal itself, as well as the radiation-shields. Level four serves mainly as a water-inlet to cool the reactor and funnel the steam to turbines above, producing energy. The water also serves as an additional layer of Radiation-shielding. Above that, the actual foundry will be placed, where the extracted materials will be processed and refined."

Normally this would have produced a flame, but they had filled the chamber with Neon to prevent Oxygen ingniting spontaneously at the absurd temperatures. Finally, with a bright flash, they could see the portal ripping itself open, flooding the chamber with light. Not a second thereafter the feed stopped, the camera melting in the extreme heat.\n§O'Energy output?'§! a few dreadful seconds of silence followed §r'Nominal, Magos.

 neocastle.25.t:0 "Taking Our Relationship Further"
 neocastle.25.d:0 "Our relationship with Neocastle has been largely positive for a while now, but it was only ever a business partnership. Even as their own merchants extended their influence over our nation, buying up more assets and dominating our markets, we foalishly continued to believe that they were only interested in maintaining a mutually beneficial trade agreement. After all, we both seemed to be growing richer and richer, and the concern of where this could lead to in the long run had all but fled our minds. Unfortunately, it seems that we were being far too generous in our assumption that the Guilds were only interested in sustainable mutual profit.\n\nAn urgent message was sent all the way from Neocastle to [MWY.GetLeader] themselves. The contents? A marriage proposal, from one Brick 'Bob' Bobcat, CEO of the Builder's Guild and Director of all of Neocastle. The letter is very polite, expressing a romantic interest and pointing to the many benefits such an arrangement could provide. However, there is also a threatening undertone to the entire thing, with a firm reminder of how reliant our economy has grown upon them and how unfortunate it would be if a rejection caused relations to sour immensely.\n\nNow, we are left with two options. We could accept this offer, marrying away our leader in exchange for lasting peace and prosperity. Alternatively, we can tell 'Bob' to go shove it where Celestia's light doesn't shine, consequences be damned."

Brick was so happy by the news that he declared a day off for all of upper-management and even gave his secretary a rather generous raise. Of course, his joy has less to do with the marriage itself and more to do with the ever-growing profit margins that are promised by it. After all, Bob's already married to the Guild, or so it was commonly remarked prior to this arrangement.\n\nNow, all that's left to do is the wedding itself along with all of the legally binding contracts that brings. Of course, both nations involved will need some time to prepare for such a great occasion, and a not inconsiderable amount of the Guild's wealth will be put towards ensuring that it is an event for the Wasteland to remember."

 neocastle.27.t:0 "They Decline"
 neocastle.27.d:0 "Unfortunate news has returned from New Mareway today, as [MWY.GetLeader] has rejected our marriage proposal. The rejection in question is far from polite, expressing a number of insults towards Bob's character that often steer into territory far more crude than what would be expected from a pony of influence within New Mareway. However, despite the insulting nature of it all, our benevolent CEO has expressed nothing but firm confidence that this matter would soon be well behind us, just as soon as our security forces finished mustering for forceful asset seizure. After all, New Mareway owes quite a bit of debt to us for all of the wealth we have provided them. It is only right that we should ensure that they pay what they owe."

 neocastle.28.d:0 "Gazing out across the sea stood a massive cathedral made of stone and glass, designed as according to the traditional Celestial style of architecture. A wide dome pointed out over the top of the structure, filtering all light that came within to create a dazzling display of colors. A large oak door covered the entryway, hiding behind it a hall lined with stylistically carved pillars. Behind yet another firm door lay the main hall itself, where hoof-crafted benches formed rows across the floor. It would be easy to mistake this impressive work as a religious building, perhaps one that even predated the War. However, that was far from the case. In an awe-inducing display of reckless spending, the treasuries of both [MWY.GetLeader] and the Builder's Guild have been partially drained through the hiring of an immense amount of labourers and the import of a large amount of resources from all across the Wasteland. Through their well-paid efforts, the towering structure was built in a record-breaking time, all for a single purpose.\n\nAs Brick stood in front of the crowd - a gathering of every affluential pony across Neocastle and Mareway alike - he couldn't help but feel the stirring of something greater than greed from within himself. What was this odd sensation, which fluttered within him? Nervousness? Excitement? Anticipation? Ah, perhaps it was all of the above - after all, this was going to be one of the most profitable deals he had made in his long history with the Guild. Speaking of which, there stood his investment now, slowly walking down the aisle towards him.\n\n[MWY.GetLeader] was dressed in a flowing white dress, tailored by only the most skilled hooves from all across New Mareway. The well-woven fabric carried with it an enchantment to give it an otherwordly shine, reflecting the already colorful lights within the cathedral into a display with an even greater degree of dazzlement."

Putting his thoughts aside though, he broke his gaze away from the memserizing enchantment and looked back out at the assembled crowd. His lawyer took this as his cue to begin the ceremony proper.\n\n'Mares. Gentlestallions. We come here today to witness the legally binding contract of marriage be signed between two consenting partners, in the name of a long lasting relationship into the future. Now, I'm afraid I'm not much one for pomp. I've known Bob here a long time, gotten him out of more trouble than I care to remember, and it was an honor to be asked to oversee this procession. That being said, I'm no preacher. So you'll forgive me if I skip some of the standard ceremony.'\n\n'Brick, do you take this pony to be your lawfully wedded wife, to love and to hold, to support and to carry, until death do you part?'\n\n'I do.'\n\n'[MWY.GetLeader], do you take this pony to be your lawfully wedded husband, to love and to hold, to support and to carry, until death do you part?'\n\nWith some hesitance, 'I do.'\n\n'Then you may now sign here, here, and here.' \n\nThe couple did just that, signing their names and dating on a contract putting their marriage into legally-binded paper. And with that, the independence of New Mareway was similarly signed away. Though [MWY.GetLeader] barely maintained the facade of happiness towards this agreement, Brick was far more openly gleeful that this deal had gone through. The wealth it would bring the Guild would be immense, all without a single drop of blood spilled."

Towards this end, three proposals have been brought forward.\n\nFirstly, the 'Rolling Thunder' proposal. Under this plan, we would focus on the development of trucks, tanks, and planes for use in asset protection. The integration of these machines into our forces would allow us to swiftly and effectively respond to any threats that may arise, dealing with problems before they can substantially impact our profit-margins.\n\nThis proposal led to a second one of a similar nature, the 'Burning Steel' proposal, offered by the Mechanicum Guild. They argue that we should go further than simply integrating machines with our organic forces and should instead pursue the creation of a mostly-robotic force in order to solve our security needs. Though this would certainly be costly, it would compensate for the disadvantage provided by our relatively low population compared to our competitors.\n\nFinally, a small group of senior security officers have stepped forward with an idea to pursue the creation of fortified positions around all of our strategic assets, calling this the 'Thousand Citadels' proposal. They maintain that our organic forces are more than capable of holding these positions, provided they are given the proper resources and means to do so.\n\nEach plan has its own merits, but we can only pursue one if we wish to keep our profit-margins in the green.

Those damn Guilds had gotten crafty, using their planes to keep an eye on the strikers to always stay three steps ahead of them. In response, they had been forced to come up with their own plans to avoid the Guilds watchful eyes and to continue their struggle away from prying eyes. Unfortunately, it had taken them far too long to figure out the true purpose of the machines circling in the sky above them.\n\nLast week, they arrived at their planned demonstration outside of the scavenging yards, only to find a small army of armed ponies waiting for them. Blue Powder had insisted they continue on with their event regardless of the prepared response to it, but it wasn't long until he was beaten down and dragged away to Celestia-knows-where. There had been an effort to fight back, of course, but they were outnumbered and outmatched. It wasn't long until they had been forced to flee. And all the while, the planes kept flying overhead.\n\nNo matter where they went from there, each and every protest was met with a well-prepared counter force. The Guilds goons seemed to know where they would be at all times. It had taken precious time, but they put two and two together, and figured out what was going on. Since then, they had been forced to live like rats, hiding away where not even the Sun could see them.\n\nThough the situation looked dire, Cherry knew she wouldn't give up on their cause. She and everypony else here would continue fighting for their rights until the very end. After all, better to live free than to die a slave to the Guilds wages."

When the Guilds thugs had stopped coming around, they had all believed it to be a victory. This illusion of having pushed them back sent their morale to new highs, heedless of the planes flying overhead. Afterall, what did it matter if their celebrations were watched? There was no way for their forces to break up their gatherings, not without them knowing well in advance.\n\nThen the first bomb fell.\n\nCherry could vividly remember the chaos following the blast. Shouting and panicking ensued everywhere, with ponies making a mad gallop for cover. That was far from the last explosive dropped that day, as more soon followed and wrought destruction.\n\nTheir usual hiding spots quickly became targets, with their temporary homes over these last few months being bombed to Tartarus. The masterminds of the Union were all missing and dead, their ponies were scattered, and still the planes flew relentlessly overhead. What could they do to an enemy with the means to kill all of them without ever laying a hoof on the ground? Their situation was entirely hopeless.\n\nIt was with this in mind that Cherry made a decision. She would return to her forepony tomorrow and ask to come back to work. Though she would be considered a traitor by those still left within the Union, they would soon likely be dead and she would still be alive, even if she did have to slave away."

 neocastleflavor.3.d:0 "Deep within the heart of Neocastle, where nothing but concrete and rebar stretches on for miles, sits one of the oldest structures to survive the Great War. What was once an ancient office building being rented to countless firms had been given new life, restored to working order by the Builder's Guild. Over the centuries, they had further expanded the towering complex, more than tripling the size of it as they continued to build upon it so that it could continue to keep up with their ever-growing bureaucracy.\n\nCountless attempts have been made to map out the great labyrinth of cubicles, offices, and occasional workshops that makeup this mighty structure. Each and every attempt has ended in failure, being abandonned thanks in large part to the countless rennovations that are seemingly always underway. More than one pony has been found lost within and old stories shared among the workers speak of corpses being found of those who died of dehydration while wandering those dull grey halls.\n\nFortunately for the Board of Directors, they would not have to travel through that dreary abyss of soul-crushing paperwork and endless inefficiency. Instead, they would only be stepping hoof into the lobby, before riding the surprisingly well-maintained elevators up to the penthouse. That room, along with the offices of upper management, stood in stark contrast to the rest of the building. Good lightning, luxruious furnishing, and a window offering a view overlooking the entire city made the top floor the stuff of legends. It would be here, in well-padded comfortable chairs surrounding a glass table, that the future of the nation would be decided."

A stone foundation supported a structure made largely of wood, a luxury within even the relatively rich lands of Neocastle. From the moment one would step hoof into the entryway, they would immediately be taken with the vast murals that stretch across the walls, depicting the many crucial duties of the Guild. It is said that this impressive piece was painted over the course of years, with dozens of artists being sought out from all across the Wasteland to take part in the project. Despite the impressive splendor on display, it was but a small part of the extensive cultural collection held within those walls.\n\nOf course, while it was required that all who walked through those halls would first witness the entryway, it would not do at all as a meeting room. Instead, that lay further in, far away from prying eyes. Behind a heavy oak door, more than heavy enough to block all but the loudest of sounds, stood the meeting hall of the Miner's Guild. A great wooden table stretched across the room, surrounded by padded armchairs that were as expensive as they were comfortable. A solitary fireplace sat at the end of the hall, providing warmth and light alike. Lining the walls were portraits of every President in the Guild's history, staring down upon those gathered with stern gazes. It was there that their Vice Presidents often met to discuss their operational strategies, and it would also be there that the Board of Directors would meet to discuss the future of their nation."

However, the true structure resided far below the hooves of the menials laboring away, within a vast bunker built within the confines of the earth. There sat a tremendous steel door, modeled after those of the the Stables of old, which stood as the gateway into the heart of the Mechanicum.\n\nOnce one passes the threshold dividing the true Forge from the outside world, they would be met with a well-lit transit station. Boarding one of the many trams that continue to run throughout all hours of day and night, one would find themselves quickly transported across a vast tunnel network that stretches underneath the entire city. As it shoots past station after station, only brief glimpses can be caught of each stop. Mundane workshops and specialized manufacturies quickly give way to odd shrines full of hooded figures praying to depictions of various machines. As the ride continues, even this is replaced by sights of countless laboratories holding within them all manner of wonderous things. At the end of the line sits the final station, where a large airlock protects the gathering hall for the Magos themselves. There are no chairs nor tables to be found within it, for such material concerns are far below the highest ranking members of the Mechanicum. Little decorations could be found within the room, beyond a large cog hanging upon the wall. It would be there that the Board of Directors, shifting uncomfortably, would decide the future of their nation."

 neocastleflavor.6.t:0 "A Home of Dreams"
 neocastleflavor.6.d:0 "Duchess Sunflower was far from destitute, still remaining firmly among New Mareway's wealthy high-society. That being said, much of her wealth was tied up already, leaving her with considerably less spending money than even many members of the minor nobility. As a result, it was necessary for her to carefully consider each and every additional expense, so as to avoid being forced to liquidate family assets in the name of staving off poverty. For most of her life, this had met going without many of the luxuries afforded to other nobles. No luxury private carriage, no new dresses each and every year, no extensively lavish parties, and most damningly, no immense mansion. Her own house had been passed down for generations and was less than half the size of even the smallest of the Duke's homes. Ever since she was a filly, she had looked in awe and envy at those personal castles which were kept by her peers, wishing to someday have one for herself. As she grew older though, she came to realize the importance of balancing her families wealth and understood that it simply wouldn't be happening anytime in her lifetime. That is, until the Guilds offered to make her dreams a reality.\n\nIn exchange for just a few small favors, she was given the home of her dreams. Imported labourers - officially coming in from Manehatten - had quickly set to work building a massive home. Sneaking the materials for it across the border was much more challenging, though with a bit of creativity they managed to pass them off as having come in from a newly established company in Hoof City. Though there were some close calls, most of this plan went off without a hitch, and her new mansion stood before her now.\n\nIt was everything she had ever dreamed of. A beautiful garden surrounded it, filled with flowers of every color. Concrete steps led up to a massive entryway, capable of holding hundreds of ponies within it. Beyond it stood a wide array of rooms to suit every purpose. Large well-stocked kitchens, immense opulent ballrooms, and more than enough guest rooms to fit half a village in. It would soon be the talk of the court, with nobles from all around begging to come tour her new home and looking at it with that same envy with which she once looked upon theirs. All she had to do was pull a few strings when the time came."

 neocastleflavor.7.t:0 "A Party Worthy of a Duke"
 neocastleflavor.7.d:0 "Brick looked around with uncertainty, as he took in the vast estate of Duke Bright Glow. The music that filled the air proved, if nothing else, unique. A mixture of odd long drawn out flutes, quick chords, and a procession of blaring trumpets played a symphony that was an mix of a marching song, a classic orchestral piece, and something far more rapid and intense than anything the Neocastle CEO would of had playing back home. Of course, the musical tones that created the atmosphere for this event were far from the main attraction. In an odd display of hedonism, the good Duke had gone all out with the budget afforded to him in order to throw a party unlike any other. Hundred-pony wide orgies filled the halls, giant feasts with seemingly unending amounts of food were available to everypony, and artistic displays lined the walls. Brick wasn't sure if it was for him, but it was something alright.\n\nSpotting the benevolent host of this event, he quickly made his way towards him. A task easier said than done, as he had to avoid several ponies too drunk to walk straight, a noble who seemed to be high on dash, and a rather bulky griffon mercenary who was performing feats of strength for a gathered crowd. Finally reaching the stallion himself, Brick was relieved to find him both able to speak and sober. He wasted no time in jumping straight into business, lest either of those things change.\n\n'Duke Bright Glow. This is quite the party you've thrown here, but you do remember our arrangement, yes?'\n\nThe good Duke took a moment to admire his work before responding, 'Of course. You enabled this all to happen, after all. It is only right that I repay in kind. Now, please, enjoy yourself. This is a party after all!'\n\nAt that, the Duke up and trotted away, leaving his benefactor sitting there with visible frustration etched across his face. That damned noble better prove himself more reliable than his conversing skills, or he would come to regret wasting all of this money on such a frivolous event."
 neocastleflavor.7.a:0 "He'll be a helpful ally... hopefully."

 neocastleflavor.8.t:0 "Big Game Hunting"
 neocastleflavor.8.d:0 "'March forth, my fellow stallions, march! For there exists before us a foe greater than any we have faced before, a beast so horrific and abominable that its very name has been stricken from all recorded history! Entire armies have fallen before it's might, I say, entire armies! Yet we have what those armies did not: Bravery in our hearts and resolve in our spirits. We shall fight with our guns, until the foul creature has smashed them into pieces! Then, we shall fight with our blades, until it has devoured those in its endless hunger! Then, we shall fight with our hooves, until it has ripped them from our very body! But even then, when all hope appears lost and our lifeblood is leaving our broken bodies, we shall continue to fight on with our teeth and our head! If we should die today, let it be said that we died fighting a foe most fierce and that we truly gave it every last bit of effort to topple this creature in the name of crown and country! Now, march! Onwards to glory!'\n\nWith zealous cheers, the assembled nobles gathered their rifles and charged behind their leader, prepared to face their 'mighty foe'. Sitting in the safety of the Duke's heavily guarded mansion, Brick spectated the entire event. Though the noble had exaggerated extensively in his descriptions, their target was still no pushover. It had cost a fortune to get a group of mercenaries to transport a hellhound here alive, but they had managed, and the Duke's support was all but assured. So long as he survived the hunt, that is."
 neocastleflavor.8.a:0 "What an odd stallion."
 
 neocastleflavor.9.t:0 "A Barge of Luxury"
 neocastleflavor.9.d:0 "To call Duke Light's investment, and by extension Neocastle's discreet investment, a boat would be a disservice to the massive floating city that now occupied the sea. It was of such size that it wouldn't even fit down the Azureway, let alone into any of the docks in New Mareway. As a result, it had docks built into it instead, for supplies to be delivered to it through smaller boats. Aboard the ship itself was a every form of entertainment imaginable, from bars to swimming pools to vast indoor apple orchards. It was a city of the future, built entirely on water and entirely for the amusement of a singular stallion. Of course, not even Neocastle's wealth alone was enough for this immense seabound complex, as the Duke himself contributed a very large portion of his own wealth towards the ludicrously high expenses.\n\nBrick had seen those expense reports himself, and he couldn't help but cringe back a bit as he took in the immensity of it all. All of this, for a single stallion and his business associates? The price to keep it afloat alone would eat up the Duke's yearly income by a substantial margin, and it was likely that this project of his would end up driving him into bankruptcy before long. However, that would hardly be Neocastle's concern. So long as he retained his title and enough influence to follow through with his side of their deal, nothing else would matter."
 neocastleflavor.9.a:0 "How much did this cost again?"
 
 neocastleflavor.10.t:0 "Aggressive Negotiations"
 neocastleflavor.10.d:0 "As Duke Water glared at the pony across from him, he had to take care not to allow his frustration to show. The stallion in question was a member of the minor nobility, landed but with such a small domain so as to be considered irrelevant in the greater political scheme of the country. Despite this, he had managed to be a thorn in his superior's side quite constantly, driving wedges between him and other nobles while amassing enough support to tackle him economically. Now, he had come to negotiate with him, making quite frankly unreasonable demands. After taking a moment to breathe, he decided to voice just those thoughts to his rival.\n\n'So, let me make sure I heard you correctly. You, after having spent the last several months building an alliance against me, undercutting my merchants, sabotaging my trade deals, and even going so far as to rile up the peasantry against me... have decided to trot right into my home as if you owned the place and make demands of me? Is that right?'\n\nThe target of his ire opened his mouth to speak, before quickly getting cut off once more.\n\n'You have made a mistake though. A grave one indeed. This is my estate, my domain, and you are nothing here. Your title, your contacts, your friends - none of it matters when you are on my land. Now, I tire of you and your relentless efforts to steal away my influence. You will not be leaving my land. Thornwing!'\n\nAt his shout, a griffon fell on top of the pony unfortunate enough to have angered the Duke. With a quick movement of his assailants claws, that pony in question was left dead on the floor with his neck twisted in an unnatural direction. The griffon who had carried out the act looked up at his temporary employer. 'You sure to have a lot of enemies, boss. That's the fifth one this week.'\n\nThe Duke took a moment to stare in disgust at the corpse marring his recently polished floor before responding. 'And now I have one less. This one shouldn't take much effort, perhaps a staged attack on the road home. We're fortunate he didn't bring any guards, otherwise this could be a bit messier. Now, while the dead may wait, I certainly won't. Hurry to it!'\n\nFollowing his orders, the mercenary quickly gathered up the body before discretely making his way out of the estates window. While this job was well paying, he couldn't wait for it to be over. Maybe he would return north, join up with the Talons in Fillydelphia. Rumor had it that there were some promising opportunities in the south too, over in the lands around Shattered Hoof. Anywhere that wasn't in Mareway, with all of its convoluted politics and stuck up nobility."
 neocastleflavor.10.a:0 "Another rival dealt with."
 
 neocastleflavor.11.t:0 "The Shareholders Decision"
 neocastleflavor.11.d:0 "Brick Bobcat was not known for admitting defeat. For his entire life, he had fought hard to get where he is today, overcoming countless rivals in the race to the top. He had done many things he wasn't proud of, but that is what made him a victor and all those who stood against him nothing more than losers. That is, until today.\n\nThe decision made by the shareholders was near universal: A complete loss of confidence in the Builder's Guild. The target of their apparent ire wasn't just Brick himself, but the entire company under him. Now as a time for change, they said. A time for somepony else to radically change the way things are done. A load of griffonshit, if Bob had ever heard any. The time for reasoning and pleading though was long since past. The only thing he could do now was pack his bags and set out for a new life, away from the luxuries which he had grown used to over the years.\n\nLooking across his office for what could very well be the last time, he couldn't help but wonder where it all went wrong. Did they not expand fast enough, diversify enough with their portfolio? Was the brand blueprint not supercharged enough? These questions and more struck him, as he struggled to rationalize the fate of his Guild, until a knock on his door interrupted his near-frantic mind.\n\nTaking a moment to recompose himself, the soon-to-be-former CEO braced himself before calling out for his visitor to come in. Anger stirred within him as the pony in question revealed themselves to be a half-robot mechanical freak, no doubt one of the Mechanicum's representatives here to see the miserable sight of a fired executive. Through gritted teeth, Bob questioned his unwelcome guest. 'What do you want? Can't you see I'm busy here?'\n\nTwo cold cybernetic eyes stared back at him before the pony responded. 'Hello, Brick Bobcat. I am your successor...'"

 neocastleflavor.12.t:0 "J.E.B.'s 'Accident'"
 neocastleflavor.12.d:0 "It was rare for all of the Vice Presidents to be in attendance of a meeting, outside of truly special circumstances. However, this definitely qualified. News had come in earlier that day which had shaken the Guild to its very core. J.E.B., President and sole proprietor of the Miner's Guild, had died in a mine collapse in the early hours of the morning. Needless to say, this sparked a crisis in the upper-ranks of the Guild as they struggled to come up with a unified response.\n\n'Well, his son is perfectly capable of seeing to his father's affairs!'\n'He's barely 7, for Celestia's sake! We can't expect him to know how to run the entire Guild!'\n'What about his daughter?'\n'She can't even count to four, and that's with the aid of her hooves. She would bring us to ruin!'\n'Well, then one of us must step up!'\n'Yes, but who?'\n\nAnd so arguing continued on, well into the late hours of the night. Their shouting escalated further, tensions ran higher, and none of them noticed the quiet thumps of bodies hitting the hardwood floor outside the thick doors of their meeting room. Nor did any take any particular notice to the sound of steel hooves clopping against that very same floor as several figures approached the ongoing debate.\n\nTwo of their number were only stopped from beating eachother senseless when the doors to their chamber were flung open and a number of armored cyberponies rushed in, manarifles trained. Behind the intruders marched an authoritative figure who looked to be more machine than flesh.\n\n'Mares and stallions, I have here a solution for your woes. Rather than pointlessly fighting eachother over which of you to seize power, why not entrust in an outside mediator to lead your beloved Guild into the future?'\n\nThe disadvantaged ponies glanced around at one another for several uneasy moments before one of them dared speak. 'And if we refuse?'\n\nIn a flash of light, the speaker was reduced to nothing more than a pile of dust. 'Then you will join your friend there. Any other questions?'"

 neocastleflavor.13.d:0 "The Mechanicum's thirst for knowledge always brings new and inventive technologies to Neocastle, this time they’ve seemed to gain a strong interest in industrial developments. With the Mining and Builder guilds being quick to profit off it, with the mining seeking to simply make workers more efficient. The builders guild however sees much profit to be made, quicker construction is always good for business. Having the interest of the guilds in newer technologies also have the bonus also gives the Mechanicum greater resources to build their research facilities, making their eternal quest for knowledge easier. Even if the other guilds care little for the cults quest, their results are highly sought after from the board."
