  bloodyarmy.1.title:0 "Red Eye Demands We Attack"
  bloodyarmy.1.desc:0 "The time has come. Red Eye has waited long enough, and he demands that we attack New Mareway with the support he has given us. Whether we are ready for the attack or not, he does not care and has made it clear that if we do not attack, he will take matters into his own hooves. What shall we do?"
  bloodyarmy.1.a:0 "Prepare for attack!"
  bloodyarmy.1.b:0 "Red Eye does not command us!"

  bloodyarmy.2.title:0 "New Mareway is Beaten!"
  bloodyarmy.2.desc:0 "The armies of New Mareway lie broken against our might, and Blood Mane sits upon her rightful throne. Of course, we cannot forget the circumstances that brought us to victory: if it were not for Red Eye's support, we would still be sulking in Maredia. The condition for that support however, was our submission to him once New Mareway was defeated. This of course would mean that the Bloody Army would cease to be an independent force, a state that is unappealing to a great many ponies in our Army, however, it is up to Blood Mane to make the final decision..."

  bloodyarmy.6.desc:0 "Strange reports have begun to filter in from Megamart, fires and smoke have been spotted across the river, centered around the Citadel of Shatterhorn. Some ponies even report hearing gunshots, surprisingly not aimed at us. Although we cannot say for sure what truly is happening at Shatterhorn, one thing is certain: chaos is spreading almost as fast as the fires, and with chaos, comes a moment of weakness..."
  bloodyarmy.6.a:0 "Gather my Retinue, now is the time to strike!"

### Leader Description

  POLITICS_BLOOD_MANE_DESC:0 "Once named §YGolden Star§!, Baroness of Megamart, Defender of the Queen, 3rd in line to the throne of New Mareway, the vicious mare now known as §RBlood Mane§! rules over the Maredia Ruins, biding her time and training her forces until she can take what should rightfully be hers: the glittering city of New Mareway. Years ago, she overthrew her aunt, the Queen of New Mareway, and took the throne, however, she did not get to savor her victory; Blood Mane and her supporters were defeated by the knights of New Mareway, her forces scattered and the would-be-queen limped back to her strongholds on the northern side of the Mareway River as the young Princess Star Gazer was crowned as the new Queen.\n\nOver the years Blood Mane would lick her wounds and gather her forces, but she could never rival the power of Mareway, at least until the status-quo in the Hinterlands to the north and east of Blood Mane's domain was turned on its head. As Red Eye swept through the Hinterlands and his power grew, so too did Blood Mane's ambition, and it was inevitable for a meeting between the two took place. A deal was reached between the two warlords; Red Eye would supply Blood Mane's army with weapons and soldiers, and when Blood Mane conquered New Mareway, she would swear fealty to him; Although Blood Mane's ambition may grow beyond what was set by that deal...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Laundry"
