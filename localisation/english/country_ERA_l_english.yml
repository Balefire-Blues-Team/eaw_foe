  ERA_battles:0 "§YBattles...§!"
  ERA_battles_desc:0 "Blood Mane and her Army have carved a name for themselves in the Equestrian Wasteland by force and willpower. Tales of the battles fought by the Bloody Army are the lifeblood of our legacy, so let's tell a good story..."

  ERA_blood:0 "§O...Blood...§!"
  ERA_blood_desc:0 "Battles are won by grit, cunning, and most importantly, by bloodshed. Our first fight was also the bloodiest, the struggle for New Mareway cost many lives, and we lost so much for it. However, not all was in the fighting, and some scars still stick with us to this day."

  ERA_whispers:0 "§R...and Whispers§!"
  ERA_whispers_desc:0 "Did somepony say something?"

  ERA_shatterhorn_raid:0 "A Moment of Weakness"
  ERA_shatterhorn_raid_desc:0 "The fortress at Shatterhorn as long been the first line against our rightful conquest of New Mareway, the imposing walls shrugging off any attack we throw at it. Truly, it seems the only way to beat that damned fort is from the inside..."

  ERA_shatterhorn_won_raid:0 "Breaking the Shatterhorn"
  ERA_shatterhorn_won_raid_desc:0 "At long last, Shatterhorn is broken! The Bloody Army surged over the river in triumph, looting and burning whatever the could find before a full response could arrive. No longer will the mention of the name Shatterhorn strike fear into our soldiers!"

  ERA_shatterhorn_to_the_victors:0 "To the Victors..."
  ERA_shatterhorn_to_the_victors_desc:0 "Shatterhorn held a vast armory for the knights and lords of the area. While many of its weapons were taken during the serf rebellion, our raiders managed to make off with the rest of their stores in our subsequent attack."

  ERA_shatterhorn_lost_raid:0 "Broken at Shatterhorn"
  ERA_shatterhorn_lost_raid_desc:0 "Although it was weakened, the Shatterhorn fortress was able to repel our attackers. The survivors returned wounded and demoralized from their experience, some not having suffered such a loss in their entire lives before now. Regardless, this should be taken as a sign that we must prepare ourselves better."

  ERA_shatterhorn_try_try_again:0 "If at First You Don't Succeed..."
  ERA_shatterhorn_try_try_again_desc:0 "We may have lost the first time around, but they always say that you should 'try, try again'! The defenders of Shatterhorn likely won't be expecting another attack so soon after the first was repelled. Let's show them why it isn't wise to let their guards down."

  ERA_shatterhorn_learning_experience:0 "A Learning Experience"
  ERA_shatterhorn_learning_experience_desc:0 "Many in the Army have never faced the elite knights of New Mareway before, but there's always a first time for everything. The Shatterhorn attack has highlighted many of the Army's strengths, but also demonstrated it's weaknesses."

  ERA_strengthen_the_alliance:0 "Strengthen the Alliance"
  ERA_strengthen_the_alliance_desc:0 "[EYE.GetLeader]'s support is the key to our success against New Mareway. Even with our Army, we are little match for the numbers and industry of the enemy. However, with some help, and a healthy dose of arms deals, we can overcome even the greatest hurdles."

  ERA_sunnyshore_wins:0 "An Unexpected Outcome"
  ERA_sunnyshore_wins_desc:0 "In a shock to the entire Wasteland, Red Eye's empire was broken by the Sunnyshore Coalition. Though the coalition is no longer a threat, we can no longer count on the support of Fillydelphia against New Mareway."

  ERA_subvert_the_alliance:0 "Subvert the Alliance"
  ERA_subvert_the_alliance_desc:0 "Although [EYE.GetLeader]'s support is needed for success against New Mareway, our end of the deal leaves much to be desired. Blood Mane must ensure her independence, and if that means stabbing Fillydelphia in the back, so be it."

  ERA_crack_open_caches:0 "Crack Open Supply Caches"
  ERA_crack_open_caches_desc:0 "During the time this land was ruled by New Mareway, a system of equipment depots and caches was instituted to ensure that knights and levies were able to arm themselves no matter where they were. Now that the land is ours, why not use the caches for ourselves?"

  ERA_press_gangs:0 "Press Gangs"
  ERA_press_gangs_desc:0 "This land and its people belong to the Bloody Army, not the other way around, and the Army needs new meat. Some of the people living in our land have been hesitant to join up, so let's send some crews to 'convince' them to do their duty."

  ERA_formalize_officer_corps:0 "Formalize an Officer Corps"
  ERA_formalize_officer_corps_desc:0 "Currently, the Army operates on "whoever is the biggest badass is in charge", and while such a system is perfect for a scrapy band of raiders, it has led to it's fair share of organizational issues. While it may be unpopular at first, the Army needs a formal system of organization if it is to survive."

  ERA_army_of_free_spirits:0 "An Army of Free Spirits"
  ERA_army_of_free_spirits_desc:0 "While the Army as a whole may be less organized than it's contemporaries, individual units preform above and beyond what could be reasonably expected of them when we give them a free pass to do as they like. Sure, it may promote "dangerous recklessness" and a "flagrant disregard of authority", but what do we care?"

  ERA_fortune_and_glory:0 "Fortune and Glory"
  ERA_fortune_and_glory_desc:0 "During long fighting campagins, or even short skermishes and raids, a vast amount of loot is obtained in the fighting. We ask of you to determine how this loot used used to help with the morale of the troops, and furthermore, the morale of everypony."

Of course, we cannot forget the circumstances that brought us to victory: if it were not for Red Eye's support, we would still be sulking in Maredia. The condition for that support however, was our submission to him once New Mareway was defeated. This of course would mean that the Bloody Army would cease to be an independent force, a state that is unappealing to a great many ponies in our Army, however, it is up to Blood Mane to make the final decision..."

Our scouts are reporting gunshots day and night, and perhaps most strangely, they don't seem to be aimed at us. Although we cannot say for sure what truly is happening at Shatterhorn, one thing is certain: chaos is spreading almost as fast as the fires, and with chaos, comes a moment of weakness..."

### Leader Description

  POLITICS_BLOOD_MANE_DESC:0 "Once named §YGolden Star§!, Baroness of Megamart, Defender of the Queen, 3rd in line to the throne of New Mareway, the vicious mare now known as §RBlood Mane§! rules over the Maredia Ruins, biding her time and training her forces until she can take what should rightfully be hers: the glittering city of New Mareway. Years ago, she overthrew her aunt, the Queen of New Mareway, and took the throne, however, she did not get to savor her victory; Blood Mane and her supporters were defeated by the knights of New Mareway, her forces scattered and the would-be-queen limped back to her strongholds on the northern side of the Mareway River as the young Princess Star Gazer was crowned as the new Queen.\n\nOver the years Blood Mane would lick her wounds and gather her forces, but she could never rival the power of Mareway, at least until the status-quo in the Hinterlands to the north and east of Blood Mane's domain was turned on its head. As Red Eye swept through the Hinterlands and his power grew, so too did Blood Mane's ambition, and it was inevitable for a meeting between the two took place. A deal was reached between the two warlords; Red Eye would supply Blood Mane's army with weapons and soldiers, and when Blood Mane conquered New Mareway, she would swear fealty to him; Although Blood Mane's ambition may grow beyond what was set by that deal...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Laundry"
