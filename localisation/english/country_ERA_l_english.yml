  ERA_battles:0 "§YBattles...§!"
  ERA_battles_desc:0 "Blood Mane and her Army have carved a name for themselves in the Equestrian Wasteland by force and willpower. Tales of the battles fought by the Bloody Army are the lifeblood of our legacy, so let's tell a good story..."

  ERA_blood:0 "§O...Blood...§!"
  ERA_blood_desc:0 "Battles are won by grit, cunning, and most importantly, by bloodshed. Our first fight was also the bloodiest, the struggle for New Mareway cost many lives, and we lost so much for it. However, not all was in the fighting, and some scars still stick with us to this day."

  ERA_whispers:0 "§R...and Whispers§!"
  ERA_whispers_desc:0 "Did somepony say something?"

  ERA_shatterhorn_raid:0 "A Moment of Weakness"
  ERA_shatterhorn_raid_desc:0 "The fortress at Shatterhorn as long been the first line against our rightful conquest of New Mareway, the imposing walls shrugging off any attack we throw at it. Truly, it seems the only way to beat that damned fort is from the inside..."

  ERA_shatterhorn_won_raid:0 "Breaking the Shatterhorn"
  ERA_shatterhorn_won_raid_desc:0 "At long last, Shatterhorn is broken! The Bloody Army surged over the river in triumph, looting and burning whatever the could find before a full response could arrive. No longer will the mention of the name Shatterhorn strike fear into our soldiers!"

  ERA_shatterhorn_to_the_victors:0 "To the Victors..."
  ERA_shatterhorn_to_the_victors_desc:0 "Shatterhorn held a vast armory for the knights and lords of the area. While many of its weapons were taken during the serf rebellion, our raiders managed to make off with the rest of their stores in our subsequent attack."

  ERA_shatterhorn_lost_raid:0 "Broken at Shatterhorn"
  ERA_shatterhorn_lost_raid_desc:0 "Although it was weakened, the Shatterhorn fortress was able to repel our attackers. The survivors returned wounded and demoralized from their experience, some not having suffered such a loss in their entire lives before now. Regardless, this should be taken as a sign that we must prepare ourselves better."

  ERA_shatterhorn_try_try_again:0 "If at First You Don't Succeed..."
  ERA_shatterhorn_try_try_again_desc:0 "We may have lost the first time around, but they always say that you should 'try, try again'! The defenders of Shatterhorn likely won't be expecting another attack so soon after the first was repelled. Let's show them why it isn't wise to let their guards down."

  ERA_shatterhorn_learning_experience:0 "A Learning Experience"
  ERA_shatterhorn_learning_experience_desc:0 "Many in the Army have never faced the elite knights of New Mareway before, but there's always a first time for everything. The Shatterhorn attack has highlighted many of the Army's strengths, but also demonstrated it's weaknesses."

  ERA_strengthen_the_alliance:0 "Strengthen the Alliance"
  ERA_strengthen_the_alliance_desc:0 "[EYE.GetLeader]'s support is the key to our success against New Mareway. Even with our Army, we are little match for the numbers and industry of the enemy. However, with some help, and a healthy dose of arms deals, we can overcome even the greatest hurdles."

  ERA_sunnyshore_wins:0 "An Unexpected Outcome"
  ERA_sunnyshore_wins_desc:0 "In a shock to the entire Wasteland, Red Eye's empire was broken by the Sunnyshore Coalition. Though the coalition is no longer a threat, we can no longer count on the support of Fillydelphia against New Mareway."

  ERA_subvert_the_alliance:0 "Subvert the Alliance"
  ERA_subvert_the_alliance_desc:0 "Although [EYE.GetLeader]'s support is needed for success against New Mareway, our end of the deal leaves much to be desired. Blood Mane must ensure her independence, and if that means stabbing Fillydelphia in the back, so be it."

  ERA_crack_open_caches:0 "Crack Open Supply Caches"
  ERA_crack_open_caches_desc:0 "During the time this land was ruled by New Mareway, a system of equipment depots and caches was instituted to ensure that knights and levies were able to arm themselves no matter where they were. Now that the land is ours, why not use the caches for ourselves?"

  ERA_press_gangs:0 "Press Gangs"
  ERA_press_gangs_desc:0 "This land and its people belong to the Bloody Army, not the other way around, and the Army needs new meat. Some of the people living in our land have been hesitant to join up, so let's send some crews to 'convince' them to do their duty."

  ERA_formalize_officer_corps:0 "Formalize an Officer Corps"
  ERA_formalize_officer_corps_desc:0 "Currently, the Army operates on "whoever is the biggest badass is in charge", and while such a system is perfect for a scrapy band of raiders, it has led to it's fair share of organizational issues. While it may be unpopular at first, the Army needs a formal system of organization if it is to survive."

  ERA_army_of_free_spirits:0 "An Army of Free Spirits"
  ERA_army_of_free_spirits_desc:0 "While the Army as a whole may be less organized than it's contemporaries, individual units preform above and beyond what could be reasonably expected of them when we give them a free pass to do as they like. Sure, it may promote "dangerous recklessness" and a "flagrant disregard of authority", but what do we care?"

  ERA_fortune_and_glory:0 "Fortune and Glory"
  ERA_fortune_and_glory_desc:0 "During long fighting campaigns, or even short skirmishes and raids, a vast amount of loot is obtained in the fighting. We ask of you to determine how this loot used used to help with the morale of the troops, and furthermore, the morale of everypony."

  bloodyarmy_EYE_support.3.desc:0 "The time has come. Red Eye has waited long enough, and he demands that we attack New Mareway with the support he has given us. Whether we are ready for the attack or not, he does not care and has made it clear that if we do not attack, he will take matters into his own hooves. What shall we do?"
  bloodyarmy_EYE_support.3.a:0 "Prepare for attack!"
  bloodyarmy_EYE_support.3.b:0 "Red Eye does not command us!"

  bloodyarmy.2.title:0 "New Mareway is Beaten!"
  bloodyarmy.2.desc:0 "The armies of New Mareway lie broken against our might, and Blood Mane sits upon her rightful throne. Of course, we cannot forget the circumstances that brought us to victory: if it were not for Red Eye's support, we would still be sulking in Maredia. The condition for that support however, was our submission to him once New Mareway was defeated. This of course would mean that the Bloody Army would cease to be an independent force, a state that is unappealing to a great many ponies in our Army, however, it is up to Blood Mane to make the final decision..."
  bloodyarmy.2.a:0 "Uphold the deal."

  bloodyarmy.3.title:0 "Past Glories"
  bloodyarmy.3.desc:0 "Blood, sweat, the sound of trashy music and the taste of alcohol, the hallmarks of any raider bar, and this night would be no different. A group of new raiders would have taken over a local bar and began merriment when, to their surprise, the boss, Blood Mane, would enter with a little entourage following her. All raiders would go quiet, looking at their boss, not wanting to piss her off, but all tension would be gone when she picked up a glass of whiskey and downed it all in one go, before demanding another, making the festivities pick up again.\n\nDrinks would be had and many words would be drunkenly slurred together, until one young raider, a lass hardly even eighteen, would speak up, asking Blood Mane for a story. After all, a boss like her, in charge of an entire realm, she's gotta have some good stories, at least so that raider said. Of course, the other raiders would insist, and so Blood Mane would set down her drink, grinning, before telling the tale of..."
  bloodyarmy.3.a:0 "The Sack of Boomtown!"
  bloodyarmy.3.b:0 "The Smackdown in Little Mareway!"
  bloodyarmy.3.c:0 "The Siege of Neocastle!"

  bloodyarmy.4.title:0 "Wounded, but not Defeated"
  bloodyarmy.4.desc:0 "As the story came to a close, all the raiders would cheer, downing another round while the bar's poor owner watched on with dismay, not getting a single cap out of this. Of course Blood Mane's exploit was legendary, she's the mare who shaped this whole place, basically the only thing between the Bloody Army and being reintegrated to New Mareway. Cheers would come from all around, a toast to their boss, but Blood Mane herself didn't seem that into it.\n\nAs if a ghost whispered into her ear, she would shudder slightly in her seat, thinking about the past, and how she got where she is. With alcohol flowing through her veins, it would be impossible to stem the flow of thoughts, and in the midst of their toast, she would tap her hoof on the table. All would go quiet and look towards her while she spoke, "‘"I didn't do it alone, I ain't some fucking super-mare. You want to know why I was able to beat Mareway? I'll tell you fucking foals why...""

  bloodyarmy.5.title:0 "A Visit from Silver"
  bloodyarmy.5.desc:0 "Stumbling back into her room after a long night of drinking and talking to the new raiders, Blood Mane's head would be pounding, with her leaning against the wall as she slams her door shut, holding her head with one hoof. Suddenly, she would feel a coolness on her head, looking over to see another hoof placed there, connected to a ghastly figure. Queen Silver Star, her neck bleeding, the wound long, jagged, and just as fresh as it was when Blood Mane put it there... or Golden Star, she used to be called that, she is that, but... she's Blood Mane too. She'd growl and pull away from Silver Star, stomping past her, headache returning in full force.\n\nSlowly, Silver Star would speak, her voice like an angel's, or an ice-pack for the drunk mare's head, light, airy, ghastly, "I never blamed you. You did what you thought was right... and you can still do that, Golden Star... stop all of this fighting, go home. Leave the past behind, leave me behind, you can't cling on forever..."\n\nBlood Mane would slowly look back at the apparition, and would take a moment before speaking..."

  bloodyarmy.6.desc:0 "Strange reports have begun to filter in from Megamart, uncontrolled fires and smoke have been spotted across the river, centered around the Citadel of Shatterhorn.\n\nShatterhorn has long stood as the bulwark to our reclamation of New Mareway. Our scouts are reporting gunshots day and night, and perhaps most strangely, they don't seem to be aimed at us. Although we cannot say for sure what truly is happening at Shatterhorn, one thing is certain: chaos is spreading almost as fast as the fires, and with chaos, comes a moment of weakness..."

  bloodyarmy.8.title:0 "The Unthinkable"
  bloodyarmy.8.desc:0 "It'd be a normal day for Blood Mane, planning her next move against New Mareway while her raiders enjoyed some entertainment around her. She'd return to her ramshackle throne room after her day, settling down in the uncomfortable throne of the Bloody Army, her mind drifting away to the past, and the future. In the midst of her relaxation, the door would open, one of her top raiders entering, looking up at her, "Boss, we've got an issue. Red Eye's gone, the fucking Sunnyshore ponies beat his ass, bad."\n\nShe'd look down at him, speaking blankly, ""He lost?" She would then lean back in her chair, looking up at the roof of her base, "Red Eye lost against some random fucking farmers." She then stands up from her throne, approaching a nearby wall, only to smash her head against it, rearing back, throwing punch and kick at it, filling the wall with holes as she pours her emotions into it, her eyes wide and wild, her breathing heavy and loud. The raider would watch her, until she steps back from the wall, taking a deep breath, before looking over at the raider, nodding, "Fucking asshole won't be able to fulfill his promises, then. It doesn't matter. We'll still win." She then glares at him, "Now get the fuck out.""
  bloodyarmy.8.a:0 "We'll Still Win."

  bloodyarmy.9.title:0 "Crossroads"
  bloodyarmy.9.desc:0 "For a while now, the Bloody Army and Red Eye's Slavers have had a mostly one sided relationship, Red Eye would provide aid and Blood Mane would promise to one day repay him with her loyalty. The day has come where Red Eye asks for what's due to him.\n\nBlood Mane would pace around inside of her makeshift throne room, frowning heavily, alone with no distractions. Red Eye's aid is needed, it'll go a long way towards helping her reclaim her birthright in New Mareway. The simplest thing would be to surrender herself entirely to him, become his loyal subject and get a whole lot of assistance to reclaim her home, but she'd forever be known as the mare who bent the knee to him, for better or worse. Or, of course, she could do some good, old fashioned, trickery. Convince Red Eye she's loyal to him, while making plans to cut off contact with the slaver. She'll get a lot of aid, but it could be dangerous. If Red Eye figured out what she was doing, he could very well have her killed, or replaced, and she'd never get what is rightfully hers. But, perhaps she could do it, and she'd be forever known as the mare who tricked Red Eye. Decisions, decisions."
  bloodyarmy.9.a:0 "Support Red Eye."
  bloodyarmy.9.b:0 "Subvert Red Eye."

  bloodyarmy.10.title:0 "New Lands"
  bloodyarmy.10.desc:0 "Land management is a fickle thing. Red Eye knew that even the lowliest of slaves could place themselves as Princesses and Princes should they find themselves entitled to even an acre of land. Well, whatever acres were left that hadn't been settled by the beasts of the wasteland. Yet it seemed as though the Bloody Army, and their own formerly bloodied Blood Mane, were attempting to make a request for control of the Central Amethyst Basin.\n\nOn the one hoof, the Basin served as a representation of the slavers' power, providing resources, a chokehold against potential enemies, and places to find any escaped slaves, should they even manage to do so. On the other, Red Eye was not a dumb colt. He knew that if he did not engage in the transfer, that it would give the dubiously sane mare a reason to attempt to subvert him, not to mention ruining a critical part of his military power in the south. Regardless of the benefit or risk, in the end, his decision was made, and it was final."
  bloodyarmy.10.a:0 "Let them have the Basin."
  bloodyarmy.10.b:0 "They will never set foot in the Basin."

  bloodyarmy.11.title:0 "The Basin Is Ours!"
  bloodyarmy.11.desc:0 "Blood Mane never had any doubts in pledging her loyalties to Red Eye and his slavers, and with this transfer of land from them to us, we step one hoof further, ever closer to achieving our goals, to reclaiming our birthright! To achieving the goal she took away from us... took away from me...""
  bloodyarmy.11.a:0 "To Red Eye and his generosity!"

  bloodyarmy.12.title:0 "A Basin Denied"
  bloodyarmy.12.desc:0 "So we didn't get the Basin, no matter. We shall win the day yet over those foul traitors. I'm sure we shall! That said, the army could do with a bit of a pick-me-up after that little mix up. Not to mention that it's obvious that Red Eye is either compromised, or no longer believes we are useful to him. It may be time for more... drastic measures.""
  bloodyarmy.12.a:0 "A little subversion never hurt anypony."

  bloodyarmy.13.title:0 "Let The (War)Games Commence!"
  bloodyarmy.13.desc:0 "Blood Mane stood within her "warbox" at Castle Hill. Once upon a time, she had dreams of Queenly duties, so dreadful and boring in the day-to-day, being balanced out with scenes of entertainment from a box like this. While she got to sit within her box, however, she could not enjoy it. Not simply staring at an empty field of ruins and practice, no, she needed something more...\n\nA loose shot from a dreadful misfire gave her the answer she was looking for, as it accidentally ricocheted into the torso of a wandering colt.\n\nA week later, the formerly empty fields and ruins were now decorated to look like a proper battlefield, one where the Army would conduct wargames under their bloodied mare's watch. It would provide great 'insight' (and entertainment) to her, while training the ponies for the conditions they may encounter when facing New Mareway forces. It didn't hurt that the 'home' team was almost entirely made up of the Army, while the forces serving as New Mareway were paid mercenaries, Red Eye's slave and soldier transfers, and a few happenstance wanderers.\n\nBlood Mane stepped up to a ramshackle podium of the box, speaking into a microphone connected to a speaker system all across the battlefield: "If this great Army is to succeed in taking back what is rightfully ours, then we cannot train idly against parasprites and zomponies. We must face each other to know the enemy."\n\nWithout another word, Blood Mane slammed her hoof into a button, and the wargame began."

Once upon a time, she had dreams of queenly duties, so dreadful and boring in the day-to-day, being balanced out with scenes of entertainment from a box like this. But simply staring at an empty field of ruins and practice, no, she needed something more... What's that? Oh... yes, yes, that'll do quite nicely...\n\nA loose shot from a dreadful misfire gave her the answer she was looking for, as it accidentally ricocheted into the torso of a wandering colt.\n\nA week later, the formerly empty fields and ruins were now haphazardly hamstrung to look like what only Blood Mane could call a battlefield, one where the Army would conduct wargames under their dubiously lucid bloodied mare's watch. It would provide great entertainment to her, while training the ponies for the conditions they may encounter when facing New Mareway forces. It didn't hurt that the 'home' team was almost entirely made up of the Army, while the forces serving as New Mareway were purely civilian forces, drug from their homes, regardless of size, age, or gender. All must submit to the Blood.\n\nBlood Mane stepped up to a ramshackle podium of the box, speaking into a microphone connected to a speaker system all across the battlefield: "Hush, you... I KNOW! Ahem. Loyal subjects, today you will have the great gift of dying to my great Army, as they strive to succeed in taking back what is rightfully ours. We cannot train idly against parasprites and zomponies, we must face each other to know the enemy. And... no, I know what I'm saying, you're the one saying I'm off-script. Anyway, buck off!"\n\nWithout another word, Blood Mane slammed her hoof into a button, and the wargame began."
  bloodyarmy.14.a:0 "he sounds of screams and gunfire would echo for years."

  bloodyarmy.15.title:0 "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow..."
  bloodyarmy.15.desc:0 "She had become accustomed to the visits from Silver Star. Each time, she would appear, her mane a little less silver, her eyes a bit more sunken, her face a little more unrecognizable. And yet her voice remained unchanged, as were her words. "You know this cannot last", "I forgive you for what you've done", "Talk to your niece, you know violence never works."\n\nBut this time, as Blood Mane mentally prepared for the barrage of vague and idiotic sayings coming from her dead sister, nothing came out. Instead, Blood Mane noticed that her dear sister no longer had a tongue in her muzzle to speak from. Her mane, now ragged and bloodied. She looked... like she did all those years ago.\n\nA new pony appeared behind Silver Star. A pony Blood Mane knew better than anyone. Golden Star. Herself.\n\n"I won't waste words, my Queen, but your time to rule has come to an end. I was supposed to rule from birth. You took what was mine, simply because you were a bit older."\n\nBlood Mane watched as the scene played out over again, as it had a decade and a half ago. But something wasn't right. It was no longer Golden Star killing her sister, it was Blood Mane being killed by Star Gazer. The hooves of Star Gazer were morphed into horrific claws, as the fake smiles and bright colors disappeared into fractures of an unholy beast. A beast that had the faces of Star Gazer and Silver Star, but the body of Blood Mane. Before Blood Mane could pull the ever-deepening claws out of her throat, the beast spoke: "It's hard getting everything you want, isn't it? You may succeed in killing me twice, but how sure are you that you won't turn into everything you despised about me"\n\nThe world broke. Blood Mane awoke with a start, her throat still in pain from her hooves having grabbed it for so long. But she knew what she had to do now. Approaching her bedside mirror, shards exploded as her hoof punched into it. Taking a shard of adequate size, she scratched it deeper into the slit over her eye."
  bloodyarmy.15.a:0 "A worthy mark of a true ruler."

  bloodyarmy.16.title:0 "The End"
  bloodyarmy.16.desc:0 "Smoke, blood, death, those scents once were almost entirely unfamiliar to Blood Mane, but now, they're her home. She stands on top of the highest tower in New Mareway, overlooking her new land, watching as raiders find and 'enjoy' the remaining serfs, killing, raping, destroying everything that's been built over two hundred years. She grins slightly as she looks down upon it all, until a familiar voice speaks from behind her, "This is all you ever wanted, isn't it?"" She didn't have to turn around to know it was Silver Star, the phantom trotting up right beside her, eyes looking over the landscape, "To think, all this time, I almost thought you were honest when you said you wanted good. To free the serfs. You've freed them alright, freed them from life."\n\nBlood Mane would simply grin more, "No... this is you. You did this! Don't think I don't know what you are, Silver! I know, I knew all along, you're just a part of me, part of my damn mind, because I know what the issue is."" She growls and leans in close to the phantom, "You've infected me. Poisoned me for years! I thought it was you all along, but no, no, no! We're all the fucking same! Look, they're burning, they're dying, the fucking serfs, the corrupt, the nobles, oh, I'm getting rid of them all, a fresh start, there's gonna be nobody left to fuck it up."" She smirks victoriously and steps up onto the edge of the balcony, looking at Silver and speaking with pride, "This fucking posion was in me since I was born. The venom of being a fucking Royal, a fucking noble, the problem with New Mareway was always us, always the fucking royals, heh, well, no fucking more! No more Stars, no more Queens, no more serfs and no more nobles, it'll all gonna be fucking cleansed!"" She then laughs manically, looking Silver in the eyes, pulling the hallucation up with her, "Fuck all of it. I win. I! Win!"\n\nWith a shift of her weight, Blood Mane would fall, becoming one with the flames, and the dead. The last thing she saw was the hallucination fade, nothing but grey skies above."
  bloodyarmy.16.a:0 "Everything Falls"

  bloodyarmy.17.title:0 "The B Team"
  bloodyarmy.17.desc:0 "Yesterday evening, Blood Mane summoned a bunch of previous serfs to her makeshift throne room, a group who used to be levies for New Mareway nobility, each having joined her in hopes of one day ending serfdom. They'd arrive to see her sat in her throne, giving them all a grin, a group of thirty ponies overall, young, old, stallion and mare, looking a bit uncomfortable with the surrounding raiders.\n\n"Ponies, I know all of you bastards, you came here because you know how fucked serfdom is, because you believe we can do better than that fucking shit. I have good and bad news. Bad news is, you're gonna go through shit for the next few months, good news is, if you fuckers do good, you'll help end serfdom. I'll make it simple, you're all going to go to Shatterhorn, the big fuck-off fortress, and you're going to infiltrate it, weaken the defenses, get those serfs inside ready to join me. Some other bastard is going to give you equipment and cover stories. You'll be known as 'The Bloody Team', and a lot's resting on you, so don't fuck it up.""
  bloodyarmy.17.a:0 "They're sending the serfs to Shatterhorn!"

  bloodyarmy.18.title:0 "Thwarted"
  bloodyarmy.18.desc:0 "Shatterhorn's infiltration was always a long shot, sadly, everyone expected in the back of their minds that it would fail, due to the fortress being so protected. The Spymaster of New Mareway, Red Willow, has proven to be a thorn in our sides, able to capture every single one of our infiltrators. Nobody really knows how he was so good at spotting them, but it must come with the experience he has in the role.\n\nBlood Mane has been taking it pretty well, for a raider boss. Nobody goes around her out of fear of getting punched, but she also doesn't pursue people for the sake of punching them. Higher up raiders say this is just her thinking of how to overcome Shatterhorn now. The unfortunate sod who delivered the news doesn't say anything, he has a concussion, since she punched him."
  bloodyarmy.18.a:0 "Ouch."

  bloodyarmy.19.title:0 "Friends On The Inside"
  bloodyarmy.19.desc:0 "It was surprising when the news came back that Shatterhorn had been infiltrated successfully, a lot of raiders, and even Blood Mane herself, didn't expect it to go as well as it did. Every serf from the B Team has successfully infiltrated and is now spreading their influence, preparing to take out any defenses and rally from within when the day comes that the Bloody Army attacks."
  bloodyarmy.19.a:0 "That was easy."

  bloodyarmy.20.title:0 "The Bloody Crowning"
  bloodyarmy.20.desc:0 "Ponies from all around New Mareway would come and watch today's event, as Blood Mane was set to be crowned, her birthright restored. It was far from a normal crowd, and far from peaceful either. Raiders, serfs, nobles, knights, those who fought for the Bloody Army and those who fought for New Mareway would stand side by side for the event. Raiders would drink and celebrate, along with some serfs, while nobles and knights would distance themselves, many of the remainder getting into fights due to rude words or unasked for opinions about the new Queen, the raiders making sure their Boss-Queen got the respect she deserved. The moment finally came, however, with Blood Mane stepping out onto a balcony, looking over her realm, grinning slightly.\n\nFrom behind Blood Mane would come the Royal chamberlain, slowly lowering the crown on her head, bowing his head, and offering her a microphone. She takes it and begins to speak, "Hey there, serfs, nobles, raiders, loyal, disloyal, Army or Mareway, nice to see you all here. Been a long fucking time coming." Many nobles would gasp, a few passing out, while she speaks, "I'll make this short and to the point. I'm Queen now. Things are going to change. Thank you to everyone who stood my side through this shit, and fuck you to those who thought I never could. That's all." She then smirks and turns around, trotting away.\n\nThey call her the Bloody Queen now. She would see a mare out of the corner of her eyes as she trots, a sad, nostalgic face. She'd ignore it, she has a realm to rule."
  bloodyarmy.20.a:0 "All hail Queen Blood Mane!"

  bloodyarmy.21.title:0 "War Loot!"

  bloodyarmy.21.b:0 "These achievements are mine!"
  bloodyarmy.21.c:0 "Reward them outside of battle spoils."

  bloodyarmy.22.title:0 "Blood Mane Requests Neocastle"
  bloodyarmy.22.desc:0 "A paper has found its way to Red Eye today, written by Blood Mane of the Bloody Army. She puts it simply, that the land of the Neocastle Guilds belongs to her due to her birthright, and that she should be given control over them, since she's been so loyal. The Neocastle lands aren't that important anyway, they'd serve Blood Mane better than Red Eye. He'd sign off on an order, all Neocastle land being given over to the Bloody Army immediately, sending it off to both his garrison leaders and Blood Mane herself."
  bloodyarmy.22.a:0 "Granted."

  bloodyarmy.23.title:0 "The Next Step"
  bloodyarmy.23.desc:0 "Blood Mane would sit in Mareway's royal dining room, a specific stallion sitting with her, Red Eye. He was invited here by the new Queen so she could finally uphold her promises, letting him have the Blood Army. He'd take a small sip from some tea, and look at her, speaking after a minute, "You know, Blood Mane, this was actually a surprise. You've been loyal, but even then, I half expected you to try and betray me. And on top of upholding your promise, you're offering to become a general? Why not try and lead this realm under me?"\n\nShe looks at him, and then smirks, shaking her head, "Look, Red Eye, this is gonna sound really fucking cheesy, but I realized something. My whole quest for the crown? I fucking enjoyed the journey way more than the destination. Do you know how fucking boring it is up here? Besides, it's not like I'd be doing anything under you, get some halfwit bastard administrator to rule this realm. My skill's always been in killing ponies. All this time I've been learning how best to lead ponies and kill other ponies, those skills are gonna be a lot better working for you than they will be working here."" He looks at her, and then nods, as she gives him a grin, "Besides, you need a competent general that ain't a fucking chicken.""
  bloodyarmy.23.a:0 "For Red Eye!"

  bloodyarmy.24.title:0 "A Tricky Supply"
  bloodyarmy.24.desc:0 "There's an old world saying, "don't bite the hoof that feeds you", and there's some wisdom inside that phrase. Simply put, Fillydelphia is the hoof we want to bite, but they're also the one who's currently feeding us, Blood Mane knows this, and she's no fucking idiot. Trying to not alert Fillydelphia to her intentions, she would have her raiders drag any potential gun providers to her, preferably someone who has the balls to actually bargain with her, yet isn't stupid enough to piss her off.\n\nBrought before Blood Mane today would be an odd pony, he's a unicorn stallion wearing shitty looking magician's wear, including a hat and cape, normally he'd be considered a fucking nutcase, but somehow he knew that Blood Mane needed weapons. He'd stand before her, grinning, even as she looks down at him, unamused, "Blood Mane, so fine to finally meet you, I love the mane, by the way, it's definitely blood. And you've got a nice flank." Raiders around him, and Blood Mane herself, would glare, with the stallion grinning, "Yeah, yeah, you aren't looking for compliments, you're looking for guns, I know. Well, watch close, fillies and gentle, well, eh, not gentle, colts, as I make a gun appear!" He then smirks, pulling an entire assault rifle out from under his cape, which was much too large to fit there, "But wait, there's more!" He then pulls out a pistol, a sledgehammer, and a shotgun, smirking up at her, "All these, and more, for half of the price anyone else will offer you. Do we have a deal?""
  bloodyarmy.24.a:0 "Guns are magic."

  bloodyarmy.25.title:0 "Tricked!"
  bloodyarmy.25.desc:0 "Blood Mane made a mistake, she was fucking stupid, no, no, it was that dealer, that fucking magician, he's the one to blame. She said she would pay him a few hundred caps for a few hundred guns, he agreed, she knows he agreed, she heard him say it. She even remembers him saying it when she woke up later, he definitely said it. She knows it. The next day, however, she found that she'd been given some faulty weapons, they exploded in her raider's hooves, with a note inside of one of the guns, saying she only gave him a dozen caps, so he gave her a dozen headaches, that fucking stallion!\n\nHis joke wasn't nearly as funny when he was dragged before her, but the bastard was still grinning the whole while. She knows she paid hundreds, and now she had guns that she isn't even sure if half of them work, and all the stallion did was laugh, say some shit about paying him properly, about how she's more dishonest than a changeling, the fucking bastard. Two of her most loyal raiders cut off his head in front of her, only right for the bastard. She tried to ignore it when his head winked at her. He's dead. Right?"
  bloodyarmy.25.a:0 "Is he?"

  bloodyarmy.26.title:0 "Tricky Demand"
  bloodyarmy.26.desc:0 "That stallion, despite how stupid he looks, and is, was able to provide guns for a few caps. It was almost highway robbery, but for some reason the stallion was willing to part with a large cache of guns for only a small amount of caps per gun. Nobody really knows why he's so willing to sell for cheap, but nobody really cares when it gets them quality guns in their hooves. All guns have been tested, they're clean, reliable, and best of all, not connected to Fillydelphia.\n\nAs Blood Mane received the last shipment of guns, she would reluctantly try to thank the stallion who supplied him. But, he was already gone by the time she did, as if he disappeared into the wind. Nobody saw him leave, and nobody even asked his name, the stallion being an enigma in the minds of everyone for weeks to come, even months."

  bloodyarmy.27.title:0 "Hang 'em High"
  bloodyarmy.27.desc:0 "It was chaos. The day was set to go so well, all of Red Eye's best slavers were visiting, it was sure to make the Bloody Army rich, maybe even richer than New Mareway, when everything suddenly went wrong. Nobody knows why, but Blood Mane would panic, maybe one of the slavers drew a gun, or maybe she just thought that they did, but she would immediately order every slaver to rounded up and hung.\n\nAs the slavers hung from the gallows, both freed serfs would watch with a mixture of enjoyment and concern. Raiders obviously loved just seeing ponies die, and the serfs were no big fans of slavers, but both groups would think the same thing. Blood Mane's getting a few screws knocked loose. The mare herself would watch with a wide smirk as the lifeless bodies swayed in the wind, her presence and violence making sure everyone kept their mouths shut."

  bloodyarmy.28.desc:0 "News has come from the Bloody Army's territory just today. Blood Mane requested some slavers to visit, so the slave trade could start up in her territory and enrich her realm, but something went wrong. Different reports conflict, but all of them agree on one thing, she suddenly panicked and had all of the slavers hung, thinking they were a threat for no discernible reason.\n\nRed Eye, furious at the betrayal of this supposed ally, would immediately cut off all ties with Blood Mane, shredding the non-aggression pact they had made. Blood Mane is a traitor, and she'll pay for her betrayal soon enough."

  bloodyarmy.29.desc:0 "It would be a day like any other for Blood Mane, plotting the fall of New Mareway, watching her raiders train, coming up with plans for causing the fall of New Mareway, planning her eventual victory speech, the normal stuff. She'd be sitting on her makeshift throne when the doors would open, a loyal raider entering, giving her a nod, "Boss, we've got a problem." She would give him a nod, with him continuing, "Some shit's going down in the realm. Some fucking beast or something out there is hunting ponies, not even eating most of them, most of the body is left behind. It's killing a whole lot of ponies out there."\n\nShe nods, and then grins slightly, "So what you're saying is that it's time for a hunt?" She then smirks, "When was the last time there was a Royal Hunt? No idea, but there's gonna be one today!" She stands from her throne, "Gather my inner group, it's time to go hunting!""
  bloodyarmy.29.a:0 "Hunting time!"

  bloodyarmy.30.title:0 "The Hunt Begins"
  bloodyarmy.30.desc:0 "Blood Mane would be standing over a map of her realm, surrounded by her closest raider bosses, advisors and military council mostly, who look over it as well. She points to a point on the map, "So, this is where the ponies are being eaten, so the beast thing whatever the fuck it is is likely right here. Whatever this thing is, it's pretty good at killing, it's got a lot of ponies, probably killed more than most of your gangs." The leaders would chuckle, with her grinning and continuing afterwards, "This should be simple enough, it's just a fucking animal. We're gonna grab our guns, we're gonna track it, and we're gonna shoot the fucking thing, probably skin it and make it into a fashionable coat. Who's with me?"\n\nEveryone around the table would grin and nod along, before cheering and raising their hooves up, ready for a hunt. After all, it's just a dumb animal, how hard could it be?"
  bloodyarmy.30.a:0 "How hard could it be?"

  bloodyarmy.31.title:0 "The Hunt Stagnates"
  bloodyarmy.31.desc:0 "It turns out finding this beast is pretty hard. Despite their best efforts, none of the hunting party have been able to find the beast. Part of this might be due to half of them being piss-drunk or high, or otherwise too busy fucking around to really pay attention to the hunt, but most animals are usually not this hard to find. Some in the group have started to complain about how long it's taking with no results, leading to two ideas.\n\nOne part of the group wants to just give up hunting this creature, it's only killing a few ponies, someone else will likely kill it eventually. They say the group should just go hunt some Radhogs, have a fucking fun time hunting them, eat some good Radhog meat, then call it a day and head back to their homes. If the beast has managed to avoid them for this long, then it can just stay unfound. The other part of the group wants to continue, not only is this thing killing ponies, but they don't want to go home without a fancy kill to their name, and without finding this fucking thing. Of course, it falls to Blood Mane to decide."
  bloodyarmy.31.a:0 ""Let's just find a fucking hog.""
  bloodyarmy.31.b:0 ""C'mon, we can't let some animal beat us!""

  bloodyarmy.32.title:0 "A Fun Hunt"
  bloodyarmy.32.desc:0 "Radhogs are some of the most fun creatures to hunt in the Wasteland. They're small enough where they don't pose a serious threat to anyone actually trying, but they're large enough to give an air of danger, plus a lot of good meat when killed. Everyone had a great time hunting them, drinking, chatting, and shooting some hogs with guns.\n\nThey'd retire that night, having a feast of radhog meat, delicious to them all, before heading back to their homes. Yeah, maybe they didn't find the creature behind this, but it wasn't killing anyone that important, just some random fuckers. What matters is that everyone had a fun time."
  bloodyarmy.32.a:0 "Let's do this again sometime!"

  bloodyarmy.33.title:0 "A Fork In The Path"
  bloodyarmy.33.desc:0 "Blood Mane told her group to suck it up and push on, and it seems like that was the better idea. After a little bit more of searching, they would come across a trail, something with large prints, leaving a trail behind in its wake, something with sharp enough claws that they leave an impression in the ground with every step. Whatever this creature is, it'll definitely make for a good coat when it's killed, and some damn good bragging rights.\n\nOne small problem comes up as they pursue the trail. After a while, there's a fork in the path, and the tracks completely disappear, somehow. Both paths look like they could possible be the right one, but the creature only went down one of them. Choosing the wrong path could lead to a bunch of wasted time, maybe even getting lost, while the right path would lead them right to the creature. After a minute of thinking, Blood Mane would shout..."

  bloodyarmy.34.desc:0 "It's been hours that the gang of hunters has been trotting, and just as they thought they saw something different, they'd discover it was the split in the path, right where they started. Everyone is unhappy at this point, spending hours trudging through the woods with nothing to show, even Blood Mane is unhappy, since she's the one who led them down the wrong path. Even the most happy and most drunk among them didn't want to put up with this shit anymore, and everyone decided that was enough for today. They'd share some nods, some stilted words of goodbye, and head back home.\n\nNobody would know what that creature was, and those who found out would likely be killed by it, but it ain't Blood Mane's issue anymore. She has more important things to worry about than a roaming monster."
  bloodyarmy.34.a:0 "That was a waste."

  bloodyarmy.35.title:0 "Cavern"
  bloodyarmy.35.desc:0 "Blood Mane, being the brilliant leader she is, managed to choose the correct path, definitely not through luck at all. After hours going down one of the two paths, the group would eventually stumble upon a cavern entrance, which is easily large enough to contain the beast within it, not to mention there are scratches at the entrance, probably due to its claws. Everyone is super tired after a long hunt, and many say that the best idea would be to get some rest, and just go after it in the morning, when everyone is rested up. Of course, this could also lead the beast to attacking them, but they're ponies, with guns, they're not dumb enough to let that happen.\n\nOf course, this could also be dealt with right now. It would be pretty easy to just rush inside and shoot the fucking beast before it has the chance to respond, but given how tired everyone is, that could also lead to someone getting killed. Some little bitch in the back would also propose another idea, that they should just blow up the entrance and trap the thing inside. This is safer, of course, no chance of dying unless someone really fucks up, but it would be a bitch move. In the end, Blood Mane decides..."

  bloodyarmy.36.desc:0 "Screams.\n\nThat was all that was heard from the scout sent into the beast's lair after breakfast. Blood Mane and her party would rush in soon after they heard that horrible sound, guns raised and ready for a fight. As they reached the end of the twisting cave, no fight would be found, only more screams.\n\nThe remains of the scout was nowhere to be seen, and a hellhoud laid flat on it's back, it's chest flayed open in ritual fashion. Most terrifyingly though, was what covered the walls - eldritch symbols that Blood Mane couldn't make sense of, making her head swim. Painted in a hypnotically beautiful glowing silver substance, Blood Mane's eyes were transfixed by the patterns of concentric circles, connected by jagged spokes.\n\nBeside her, Double Tap, a formidable gang boss, screamed, her eyes beginning to leak blood. Blood Mane didn't even spare a glance. She stared blankly at the symbols on the walls; they drew her in, consuming her thoughts. All the while more and more screams echoed throughout the chamber.  Later that day, Blood Mane was found stumbling out of the woods, alone, with no memory beyond those final screams."

  bloodyarmy.37.desc:0 "Blood Mane would decide to push into the cave, making all the tired bastards raise their rifles and guns, following behind her as she slinks into the cave. Entering into it, they'd eventually come across the beast itself, and it is a beautiful bastard. Big, muscular, and fucking dangerous, it's a Hellhound, a feral one, no wonder it managed to kill so many ponies. Blood Mane would give everyone a nod, the creature not noticing them yet. All at once, they would lift their guns and unleash a barrage of bullets onto the creature. It'd howl in pain and turn around, charging them, but even its strength can't fight the strength of bullets. In the middle of its charge, Blood Mane would shoot a shot right into the thing's eye, hitting it right in the brain, making it collapse on the spot, blood getting all over the cave floor.\n\nEveryone would go home soon after, Blood Mane carrying a brand new pelt in her bags, ready to be made into a coat, or whatever else she could need. Not only do they now have the pride of having killed a Hellhound, they also have saved the lives of many ponies, and avenged many others"

For him, that was enough, others could fight for him, as long as he had food to eat and air to breathe, he'd be happy. Then Blood Mane came along and, ever the opportunist, he sided with her, his gang became her gang, and he became an 'Officer', whatever that means. He would discover it means he gets to relax in the back while others fight for him, enjoying snack cakes while his raiders fight hard for him, no consequences in sight.\n\nThen came Shatterhorn, it was a normal raid, and so the unicorn stallion just sat back and let his gang lead a charge during it, only for that maneuver to cause his gang to be surrounded, the first domino in the string needed to spell out failure. When he was told to report to Blood Mane, he just gave her a nice grin, a few compliments, playing off the defeat like it was nothing, after all, just a few useless raiders were lost.\n\nAll the raiders in the room were caught off guard when Blood Mane approached him, calmly, before suddenly lunging out, grabbing onto his horn with her teeth, and, with a single pull of her neck and a shove of him backwards, shattering it into pieces. He'd cry and writhe in pain, while Blood Mane drew a pistol, speaking softly, "Stallions, let me make something clear." She'd point her pistol down, at his crotch, before pulling the trigger:"

  army_affairs.2.desc:0 "Blue and silver, Blood Mane had come to hate those colors. Ever since that damned magician ripped her off, she's been seeing it everywhere. One of her trusted officers, a blue stallion, would dye his mane silver, and she swears she can see him wink at her every so often, when he doesn't think she's looking. Her bedsheets, she knew they were red once, but now they're blue, with silver trim, in her dreams, when she looks up into the sky, that's all she sees, blue and silver. . . okay that might be normal but still!\n\nWaking up this morning, Blood Mane would rub her eyes, looking over to a bedside table, seeing some sort of weird pre-war flier on it, advertising some magician, who's fucking blue and silver, of course. As she would move over to throw it away, touching the old paper, she'd blink, and suddenly remember something she forgot. She remembers talking to the arms dealer, the blue and silver stallion, and remembers right after it, she commanded her soldiers to only give him a dozen caps. Said the missing hundreds were just a tax for the stallion being fucking annoying. And the execution, she didn't kill him, no, she doesn't think, he disappeared, it was a knight, a Mareway knight, a prisoner, that's who she executed, not the stallion, the stallion was gone.\n\nBut no, that can't be right. She would have known, she knew it was the stallion, it wasn't a knight, she gave hundreds, not a dozen. Didn't she? Of course, this could all be a trick, some, some magic in the pamphlet, making her think she's crazy! But she's not crazy! Or, or maybe she is. Maybe she was. Maybe she's wrong."

In front of her would appear ghastly images, herself, Sir Strongwing, while she carries the same dagger she used to kill her sister, the ghoul would be carrying a spear. He would charge towards her younger self, with her charging back, dagger held within her mouth. The ghoul would stop in his tracks and being his spear up, with her unable to stop in time, the sharp point of his spear cutting right through her eye, into her brain, killing her... No, that's not what happened. She stopped a second early, and the spear just cut her cheek and forehead, missing her eye.\n\nShe'd reach a hoof up, gingerly touching the scar on her eye, as she watches her ghastly younger self disengage, blood dripping into her eye and onto her mane, as she turns and gallops away, her supporters following shortly after. Of course, that's how she got her new name, she was running so fast that the blood from her wound got into her mane, staining it until she had no choice but to dye it the same color. But what if she stopped too late? What if she were but an inch closer? Standing up from her throne, glaring at the ghastly image of Strongwing, she would declare:"

The walls in this room would be covered in wild colors, foal's drawings covering their every inch, with the mare letting out a small smile as a ghostly image appears before her. There she is, and Star Gazer, just a little filly back then, visiting her favorite- well, only auntie. They found a pack of crayons in the Megamart, and Blood Mane let her do whatever she wanted with them, always having a bit of a rebellious streak.\n\nThe little Star Gazer would hold five crayons in her mouth at once, painting a colorful rainbow all around the wall, along with colorful pictures of her mom, of Blood Mane, and of her favorite Duke, Littleward, she even attempts to draw the sun, though she makes it blue since she's never actually seen it. A younger Blood Mane would grin and laugh as she watches the little filly, speaking in a hopeful voice, ‘You aren't afraid to express yourself, Gazer. I hope you never gain that fear, confidence is cool.'\n\nStar Gazer would smile and nod, before offering Blood Mane a red crayon. The mare grins and rolls her eyes, taking it, trotting to a painting of the three of them together, before suddenly stabbing the crayon into the neck of her sister, puncturing the wall, where blood would begin to flow copiously. Both younger and modern Blood Mane would be swept up in the blood, screaming as their idyllic memory fades away. She'd only snap out of it when a knock comes to the door, the whole vision fading, her vocal cords raw from screaming."

Pulling her leg away, and blinking, she would see someone in front of her once more. Her sister, Silver Star, stood there in the midst of her room, staring at her. Slowly, with a voice like an angel, she would speak, "I understand, Golden Star. I understand."\n\nBlood Mane looks at her, taking a second to breathe, before that breath turns into a growl, and then into a shout, "No, you don't! You don't! You never did! You fucking arrogant bitch, why the fuck would I kill you if you fucking understood!" She stomps closer to the ghost, "You were just like the rest of them, slave masters by any name, cracking the whip against any serf who stepped out of line, and you say you understand?! All you understand is fucking pain and choking after I cut your fucking throat, bitch! You don't understand what they do, you don't understand why I had to do it, you don't understand shit! That's why the throne was mine! Fucking mine! Not yours, because I understand, you don't!"\n\nSilver Star would look at her with sad eyes, speaking softly, "I understand. But you don't need to choose violence any longer. You can change-" Blood Mane shouts and turns around, bucking the ghost with both her legs, making it disappear as her hooves hit thin air. She breathes quickly, before spitting on the ground, speaking once more with venom:"

She speaks with a soothing voice, "Golden Star, you must move on. I understand. I forgive you. Don't let me hold you back."\n\nBlood Mane would glare at her for a second, before relenting, laying on her back, "How the fuck am I supposed to do that? I loved you, Silver, you know that. You were a great pony, a great pony who did bad things, and every day, I wish I had you here with me, I wish Star Gazer had her mother, that she had her aunt, that I had my sister." She shakes her head, "But I can't have that, it'd be unfair, not while serfs are still out there. Serfs want the same, you know? They see their sons, their brothers, their fathers go off to fight in levies, and never return, their mothers are taken by nobles and not seen again, and if they do anything against it all, nobody forgives them. No. I'm just forgiven because I've got 'special blood', because of who gave birth to me. Is that fair?" She looks over at Silver, "Is it fair that I had to make that decision? What I did to you, Silver, it was for them. But if I could go back...""

She picked up two books recently from a traveling merchant, one is some book called ‘Peace and War' by some bitch or bastard. . . Asshole, that fits mare and stallion, some asshole called Leaf Trotstoy. It seems like it'll teach her something about the army, it'll likely be good to read, but fuck it would be so boring.\n\nThe other book is from far to the north, so far away it likely doesn't exist to her, and it's titled ‘How To Pet A Deer and Have Them Enjoy It: An Illustrated Guide' by someone called Nota Dear. Apparently there's something called a Deer and they really enjoy to be pet. Blood Mane will never meet a deer, this will help her in no way. But also, the Deer are so adorable, she would enjoy reading how to pet them a lot. Her dreams would be much more pleasant with thoughts of fluffy deer on her mind.

No ghosts, no whispers, no smells or noises, just normal. Completely normal. It reminds her of before, back when she was Golden Star. She could almost imagine properly meeting her younger self... how would she react?\n\nBlood Mane has done a lot of wrong. But it was worth it, right? Taking over this territory had cost a lot of ponies their lives, but in the end, she'll be able to free the serfs. A bit of suffering to end more suffering. Of course, allying Red Eye would be a bad thing to many, he's a slaver, after all, and she's supposed to be against serfdom, which is just another form of slavery. But Red Eye doesn't support slavery to its own end, he only supports it in that it helps him rebuild, and when it isn't helping, he'll toss it aside. He's a lot like her, in that way. Right now, she kills ponies, the same serfs she wants to free, but not because she wants to, just so she can see all of them free. Once she's Queen, she'll be peaceful. Maybe she'll be able to settle down, live a normal life. Retire, perhaps. The crown was always just a means to an end, a shiny metal object.\n\nBlood Mane would look to herself in a nearby mirror, reaching up to rub her scar, before cracking a small smile."

Years ago, she overthrew her aunt, the Queen of New Mareway, and took the throne, however, she did not get to savor her victory; Blood Mane and her supporters were defeated by the knights of New Mareway, her forces scattered and the would-be-queen limped back to her strongholds on the northern side of the Mareway River as the young Princess Star Gazer was crowned as the new Queen.\n\nOver the years Blood Mane would lick her wounds and gather her forces, but she could never rival the power of Mareway, at least until the status-quo in the Hinterlands to the north and east of Blood Mane's domain was turned on its head. As Red Eye swept through the Hinterlands and his power grew, so too did Blood Mane's ambition, and it was inevitable for a meeting between the two took place. A deal was reached between the two warlords; Red Eye would supply Blood Mane's army with weapons and soldiers, and when Blood Mane conquered New Mareway, she would swear fealty to him; Although Blood Mane's ambition may grow beyond what was set by that deal...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Laundry"
