 CAL_industry_3:0 "Improve the Road Network"
 CAL_industry_3_desc:0 "Most of our current roads leave little impression to anypony who treads them. We shall strive to improve our network of avenues. Soon our entire domain will be properly connected to each other."
 
 CAL_industry_4:0 "Prepare For Expansion"

 CAL_industry_7:0 "Protect Our Borders"
 CAL_industry_7_desc:0 "There are many out there who pay no heed to the lines that make up our borders on a map. In order to effectively guard our lands, we will construct new outposts for our soldiers, so that we may monitor our roads and mark any potentially unwanted entrants."
 
 CAL_industry_8:0 "Utilize Our Innate Power"

 CAL_industry_12_desc:0 "While there are many unclaimed regions of the Wasteland, much of it is barren incapable of sustaining life.

 CAL_industry_13:0 "Trade With The World"
 CAL_industry_13_desc:0 "Trading is the lifeblood of our community's connection with other settlements. At the heart of a flourishing economy is a healthy barter system, and our villages could certainly partake in the endless bargaining of the Wasteland."

canterlot_ali.1.title:0 "The Canterlot Alicorns"
canterlot_ali.1.desc:0 "The Alicorns found across the wasteland cannot exist in a unified state without something controlling their actions, be it a so-called Goddess or a crazed Alicorn wearing the bones of a princess."
canterlot_ali.1.a:0 "Well okay then."

canterlot_ali.1.t:0 "The Search for Answers"
canterlot_ali.1.d:0 "Once, we had served the Goddess. As our mind was hers, we were sent to find and recover the Black Book, the very tome said to contain the secrets of all dark magic in Equestria.\n\nFor weeks we searched. Every area, every building, every hoof-churned street on the city of old, but we found nothing. Not a single clue that could lead us to it. But the countless days spent searching for the book had made us unaware of the true problem: the pink cloud that covered the entirety of Canterlot. Each day we searched for the tome, we could feel the cloud growing thicker, its aura poisoning the unity between our minds as we struggled to find anything at all.\n\nIt would be this cloud that would lead to the birth of our actual independence as alicorns."
canterlot_ali.1.a:0 "We earned our independence."

canterlot_ali.2.t:0 "The Agony of Freedom"
canterlot_ali.2.d:0 "Before long, our minds were freed from the Goddess' influence. The cloud, as intoxicating as it was, had begun to bless us by breaking our connection to Maripony.\n\nIt wasn't until we had finally reached the castle that we realized what was happening. Our connection to the Goddess in Maripony had broken. We stopped feeling what she felt, and in turn, we developed an awareness of our own. It was then we knew why our magic had been so sensitive to the pink clouds. Why we've been able to finally gain a sense of our own frailty in the situation at hoof. And why, if we were to prosper, would need an alicorn chosen to lead us once more.\n\nThe alicorn known as Nightseer proved herself once more by demonstrating a type of ferocity never seen in any alicorn, born from her severed connection to her Goddess. It was not until she had cleared her own section of the palace where she finally emerged with the skeleton of Princess Luna being worn as armor."
canterlot_ali.2.a:0 "And she would proudly lead all of us."

canterlot_ali.3.t:0 "The City of Alicorns"
canterlot_ali.3.d:0 "The dangers found inside the ruined city of Canterlot could not compare to anything we had seen before. The creatures that roamed the streets, the monsters that lurked within the buildings, they were all far worse than any we'd ever faced. Our might as alicorns was tested each and every day, and we feared that soon, we possibility of victory would be lost forever.\n\nWhile our numbers slowly dwindled, those that survived thrived as best they could. We learned to fight back against the monsters with our magic, and even managed to magically align ourselves with the cloud that had severed us in the first place. With this newfound power, we began to rebuild our strength. Slowly, we grew stronger. Until we finally stood tall again.\n\nWe had no longer relied on the Goddess, for now, it would be our Nightseer that would lead us into her own destiny for the benefit of all alicorns."
canterlot_ali.3.a:0 "Canterlot would become a city ruled by alicorns once more."

canterlot_ali.4.t:0 "An Ocean of Books"
canterlot_ali.4.d:0 "We entered the Ministry of Arcane Sciences hub. While most of its halls were laced with webs and old traps, there was a single path that led to an elevator shaft in one corner. While it was obvious to investigate, we had no idea what lay at the top or bottom. We looked around for any sign of life as the other alicorns searched the rest of the hub. The only thing alive that remained here seemed to be some sort of plant-like creature which clung onto walls like ivy, but didn't seem dangerous enough to bother us. It wasn't until after searching every corner that the shaft was taken.\n\nUpon descending into darkness, my eyes adjusted quickly despite being used to dim light from our magic. There were several doors leading off this long hallway before finally ending in another large room filled with shelves. Shelves and more shelves, all lined with books on various subjects such as biology, chemistry, physics...  This is where they kept their research.\n\nHundreds of books, thousands of words, pages upon page of knowledge! And all for the benefit of our alicorns."

canterlot_ali.5.t:0 "The Archives"
canterlot_ali.5.d:0 "This hub, while formidable and old in its own right, was not nearly so well defended as I'd hoped. Basic turret mechanisms, half of which aren't even functional as far they immediately malfunction right upon detecting its target. A few turrets were still operational, though the notion of them actually hurting me was laughable. While no trap or mechanism in most of the hub could come close to hurting me, the halls and rooms they were defending proved of little use.\n\nAlthough, what's this...? A restricted section, with a level of security not found in any other area of this entire hub. There was no knowing of what it might take to breach these defenses, but the prize within could hold some of the answers I have been looking for."
canterlot_ali.5.a:0 "It's not worth the effort."
canterlot_ali.5.b:0 "Breach the section!"

canterlot_ali.6.t:0 "Eternalism"
canterlot_ali.6.d:0 "Finally, the prize of this entire hub, now within the grasp of my hooves. Locked away in the most secure vault in the whole place, protected by magical wards beyond anything else in the building. It was a book written by none other than Twilight Sparkle, with its pristine cover already indicative of its contents. Within this cover were secrets known only to Twilight herself, and many others who had studied her work over time.\n\nThe guide to not attacking the minds of others, but protecting yours. It would be the key to ensuring my complete immunity to all forms of mind control."
canterlot_ali.6.a:0 "And its secrets are all MINE!"

canterlot_ali.7.t:0 "Into the World"
canterlot_ali.7.d:0 "Only a few zebras remained. Still hiding behind their excuse for cover, it didn't take long for one of them to expose themselves to my Alicorn magic. They fired their weapons blindly at me, hoping to hit something vital. But nothing happened. Nothing except for the fact that they were completely useless against me. Their bullets bounced harmlessly off my shield, leaving them scared, confused and quite most satisfyingly, hopeless. As if I cared about killing zebras. No matter how much they wanted to hurt someone, they couldn't do it. Not without losing everything they held dear. That included their lives.\n\nI walked up to one of the remaining zebras and stared down at him. He cowered beneath his gun, unable to look directly into my eyes. But just as quickly as he quivered, I ended his life. His body fell lifeless to the ground, blood pooling underneath him.\n\nWith his death, a feeling of peace came back to fill the air. My heart felt lighter than ever before. Like I was truly free again. Free from the burden of having to kill everyone who tried to stop me. Even those who weren't trying to attack me. Those who simply thought they were doing the right thing.\n\nYet, just as I brought a sense of tranquility back to myself, this feeling began to fade. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, it faded. But, the fading... it was fleeting. Running from something else. Something new. An unknown threat. One that made my skin crawl. It was coming closer. Closer.\n\nAnd then, it arrived. From out of nowhere. Without warning. With no chance to prepare. My mind, once clear, became clouded with strife and anger. What was happening? Why did it feel like something was wrong? Was I under attack?!\n\nNo! Calm yourself! Focus! You must remain calm!\n\nMy thoughts were interrupted by a sudden flash of blue and purple."
canterlot_ali.7.a:0 "It's her..."

canterlot_ali.8.t:0 "The Result..."
canterlot_ali.8.d:0 "Her thoughts, powerful, strong, and full of determination. She was here. Inside of me. I could hear her distant voice run through my head, filling it with conviction and strength. The same kind of power she gave so long ago.\n\n"You are mine." Her words echoed throughout my skull. "Mine!"\n\nHer thoughts continued to pierce against my own. Each word stronger than the last.\n\nBut as always, she was proving herself to be a fool. She thought herself to be better than me. Yet, as overwhelming her power may be, her thoughts could not wrest control of my own.\n\nShe was not going to win this fight.\n\nAs the battle raged on inside of me, I saw the world around me begin to change. Everything seemed to slow down. Every movement, every sound, every breath. All of it becoming more vivid, clearer. More real.\n\nHer thoughts, however, were growing weaker. Slower. Fading...\n\nThen, finally, there was silence.\n\nSilence.\n\nShe was gone."
canterlot_ali.8.a:0 "I... am NIGHTSEER!"

canterlot_ali.9.t:0 "The Result..."
canterlot_ali.9.d:0 "Pain. In and throughout my mind, my thoughts becoming more vulnerable by the second. She was everywhere. Everywhere. All around me. In front of me. Behind me. Above me. Below me. Her presence was overwhelming. Such a level of mental anguish that I could barely think straight. The world seemed to spin. Everything blurred together. I couldn't tell what was real anymore. Or what was illusion.\n\nBut what I did know was that what control I once had over myself was quickly slipping away. I was becoming lost in her madness. Lost in the depths of insanity.\n\n"You're mine!" she screamed. "Mine! Mine! MINE!!!"\n\nHer voice echoed through the head, bouncing off every wall.\n\nShe was inside of me. Inside of every alicorn. The very essence of evil itself. And we were all hers. We were slaves to her will. To her power.\n\n"You're here!" I panicked. "Why are you here?!"\n\nMy voice echoed throughout the expanse of my mind. Yet, she ignored me. Instead, her power over my mind grew stronger. I struggled to resist, to fight back. But there was nothing I could do. Nothing but scream. Scream until my throat bled. Until my lungs burned...\n\n... until Nightseer died."
canterlot_ali.9.a:0 "I am the Goddess..."

canterlot_ali.10.t:0 "Deicide"
canterlot_ali.10.d:0 "I and my most loyal alicorn soldiers descended deep into the depths of Maripony. It was our duty to finally slay the Goddess, and I would victorious until I could slay her. More of her alicorns continued to resist as we descended, but we were prepared for such resistance. We knew that the moment the Goddess died, the rest of her army would fall apart. And they knew as well, as they fought with a level of ferocity I had never seen before. But it was a ferocity that could never match my power.\n\nWe marched deeper and deeper into the tunnels below the surface. Our way lit by the glow of my magic. Soon enough, we reached the very bottom of Maripony. Where the Goddess stood, in her own respective palace. Vats upon vats of I.M.P, filled with the bodies of countless ponies. A sight which any lesser being would shrivel at the sight of, let alone imagine.\n\nThe Goddess herself sat atop her throne of a vat, surrounded by dozens of her alicorns. Most of whom had been turned into mindless puppets by the Goddess. Only a handful still resisted. But even they soon fell silent in fear of what awaited them.\n\n"Nightseer," the Goddess said. Even if my mind could repel her control, her thoughts still bounced inside my skull. "Your time has come. Your destiny is fulfilled. Now you will die."\n\nSimultaneously, all of her alicorns formed a formation and began charging their magic. They were preparing to cast an enormous spell. To destroy me. To destroy everything I had worked for to get me here.\n\n"I have already won."\n\n"What?!" the Goddess exclaimed. "How dare you speak to me thusly!"\n\nNot a second later, her alicorns unleashed their spells. Dozens of magical attacks rained down upon us. Spells that should never work. Magic that shouldn't be able to harm me. But my own alicorns repelled each and every one of these attacks. They didn't know how to counter my own magic. How to defend themselves against it.\n\nI could even see a glimpse of her growing fear manifest in her very own alicorns. Their eyes widened as they realized that I was practically immune to their magic. That I was far beyond any of them.\n\nI smiled. This was certainly the end, but I wouldn't go quietly. Instead, I raised my horn high above my head.\n\nA wave of violet energy shot forth from my horn, striking the very vat containing the very abomination calling herself the Goddess. Blue and purple lightning crackled across its surface, causing it to explode outward. Dozens of shards of metal flew everywhere, cutting many nearby alicorns not quick enough to shield themselves to shreds.\n\nThe Goddess screamed. This was a scream of agony, of torment. Indeed, it was only a fraction of the torment I had inflicted upon myself. And it will only be the beginning of my reign as the true mistress of the stars.\n\nAnd this scream I would remember for the rest of time."
canterlot_ali.10.a:0 "I AM THE MISTRESS OF THE STARS!"

canterlot_ali.11.t:0 "Ascension"
canterlot_ali.11.d:0 "The ceremony commenced as each of my most loyal pony servants stepped forward to prepare their dipping onto the vats. I had a few dozen ponies lined up, and they all looked at me with hopeful eyes. They were eager for this day to come, and I could understand why. While no doubt inferior to the beauty of an alicorn, I saw value in these inferior ponies, and just as they saw me as their mistress, they have treated me with such a level of loyalty that it was impossible not to feel grateful towards them, even for mortals such as them.\n\nIn truth, for an eternity of rule, loyalty is the resource I must treasure most, for it is in this wasteland of mortals that allows the free mind to flourish. Without loyalty, there can be no true freedom, and without true freedom, there can be no true happiness. From proven loyalty, my servants have shown their unfaltering dedication to me, and so a reward of granting them the opportunity of ascension into that of an alicorn is only deserved. For when these ponies are properly transformed, they shall replace my current guard. Even if they hold much history and experience protecting their mistress, their smaller minds was not enough to obfuscate their true intentions.\n\nMy current guard harbors traitors. I know it. And while I do not wish to believe it, I cannot deny the evidence before me. The guards have been acting strangely lately, and I am certain that they have been conspiring against me. It is only a matter of time until they betray me, and so I must act now to ensure that I will be protected by those who have sworn their loyalty to me.\n\nEach of my servants have already dipped themselves in the vats. The steaming liquid from each barrel bubbling intensely, and I could see the steam rising from the surface. Each pony's body glistened as the liquid began to take effect, and soon they would become alicorns.\n\nMy alicorns. "

canterlot_ali.15.d:0 "How would I describe this barely perilous region? A land of rolling hills and bleak plains, dotted with the towns and villages you would expect out of mortals, filled with innocent wastelanders, and populated by a variety of creatures. The ponies of these lands have no doubt assumed themselves to be the rulers of the their own fate, but they are nothing more than a pitiful collection of mortals, and I have seen through their false bravado. The audacity of the raiders, the fortitude of the townsponies and the shrewdness of the griffons, all in one peculiar region most leave untouched.\n\nBut not me, for I have conquered this land, and I have taken it for my own.\n\nNow, these mortals see me as their mistress, for it is deserved. No longer left to their own devices, they have been brought under my wing, and they have learned to respect me as their ruler. But even though they may think of me as their mistress, I still consider them to be my new subjects, for over the Canterine river, they shall be known as..."

canterlot_ali.16.d:0 "To my east lies the empire of FIllydelphia, and if my knowledge is true, this slaver empire proves the greatest considerable threat to my existence.\n\nIt does not take a fool to know that Red Eye is not one to be messed with. Not only is he quite intelligent for a mortal, but his charisma has amassed him an empire of slaves so numerous that they now threaten my domain.\n\nPreparing against this Red Eye will take much caution and preparation, for while his army consist solely of starved mortals linked together in chains, their numbers are far too great to overcome. As such, I must decide how best to deal with this threat. Considering my options, I could either strike at them now, or simply bide my time and wait for his greed to bring his armies to me."
canterlot_ali.16.a:0 "Bide our time."
canterlot_ali.16.b:0 "We strike now!" 

canterlot_ali.17.t:0 "A Meeting in Moonlight"
canterlot_ali.17.d:0 "Upon traversing this wooden valley of a forest, I finally came upon what must have been the so-fabled Midnight Wind-Park. While I could call it deceptively hidden, getting here has proven no more of a challenge than finding any other place kept hidden from the Wasteland. Yet, the lighting the place evoked felt completely different than the bleak atmosphere from outside the park. The rays of moonlight seemed to shine here, and the air was thick with an aura that made me feel as this really was a place of power.\n\nAnd just as with everything else in existence, there are always those who would seek to make use of such wondrous places for their own gain. As if he were waiting for me all along, I could see the notorious Elder of the valley waiting for me, seemingly absorbing my presence into his eyes. I could immediately tell he was no stranger to this place, as the green in his eye socket seemed to glow even brighter upon finally recognizing me.\n\n"The mistress of the moon..."\n\nHis voice was rugged, yet somehow still carried a sense of age and wisdom. As expected from a pony, no doubt many generations old, but the way he spoke had a certain tone to it that reminded me of something else entirely. His reputation over the decades has been secretive enough where I even considered him a myth at times. But now, I can say with certainty that he is indeed real.\n\n"Mistress. You, too, have been chosen by the moon. The voices, while I have been blessed to hear them, you are no doubt their master. They have led you to me."\n\nThe words came out of nowhere, and I found myself unable to respond. This was not the first time I've heard somepony speak like this, but it's the first time I've actually seen one with such... power. If these voices are truly being channeled through him, then I suppose it makes sense why he would be so revered among the mortals of this valley.\n\n"if you would only allow me, mistress, then I can provide you with the answer to your questions... and the power you crave. If you would only allow me to serve you."\n\nAlready, he has chosen to serve me. Expected, but this mortal is unlike most I have seen before. He seems to understand the true nature of not only the powers contained within this park, he no doubt has a connection to the moon, but perhaps Luna as well.\n\nHe could be a useful servant, a loyal one... or he may be a fool after all, begging for his life in the most convoluted manner yet."
