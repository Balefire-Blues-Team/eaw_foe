 fillysr.1.title:0 "The Great War"
 fillysr.1.desc:0 "In the midst of the chaos the Steel Rangers had little time to get what they could into the bunkers that they would inhabit for many years to come.The options of what to take with them are few, and they have too little time to take everything with them. For the most part their options were the many civilians and Stable-tec Employees that were pleading for help at the Rangers Doorstep, or the sizable quantities of military, industrial, and magical Materials stored in a nearby Weapons Cache. In the end though, the Rangers chose..."

 fillysr.2.title:0 "Stable-tec HQ"
 fillysr.2.desc:0 "The HQ of the very company that created the stables and ‘possibly’ saved countless pony lives, now rests as a treasure trove of technology known and lost. Among these technological toys is a vast array of construction equipment, both known and unknown to the wider world. The Rangers had thought for a time on how to use it; clear the ruins of the old  HQ and the Rangers slice of Fillydelphia, or use it to help rebuild the entirety of the Fillydelphia Ranger’s territory, both present and future. Eventually they settled on... "

 fillysr.2.b:0 "Rebuild the Wastes"

 fillysr.3.title:0 "Elder Blueberry Sabre"
 fillysr.3.desc:0 "For the longest time, the Fillydelphia chapter has been under the guidance of Elder Blueberry Sabre. During her time as Elder she has kept RedEye at bay while garnering support for her cause; however, the chapter is experiencing more and more internal corruption, and many voices call for the Elder to remedy this"
 fillysr.3.a:0 "Rallying the Chapter around her"
 fillysr.3.b:0 "Stamping out Corruption"

 fillysr.4.title:0 "The Scribes Problems"
 fillysr.4.desc:0 "The Steel Rangers Scribes have been a keystone of our organization, researching and dissecting old world technology that we have gathered. This Pillar of our chapter however, is now being put into question, should they continue to sit and look at old world wonders? Do they need reforms? Or are they even needed at all?"
 fillysr.4.a:0 "Its fine as it is"
 fillysr.4.b:0 "They will be useful, in time"
 fillysr.4.c:0 "Scribes? We need more Guns!"

 fillysr.5.title:0 "The Knight's issues"

 fillysr.5.a:0 "Punitive stikes should do the trick"
 fillysr.5.b:0 "Maybe we can talk to them?"
 fillysr.5.c:0 "we will wipe them out, no Survivors!"

 fillysr.6.title:0 "Political Divisions"
 fillysr.6.desc:0 "The Elder is in hot water, many are asking about what to do with the members of the chapter that are not 100% aligned with the chapter’s doings, as their numbers grow with each day. Paladin Strawberry Lemonade advises The Elder to let bygones be bygones and bring in the dissenters back into the fold; however, Star Paladin Nova Rage wishes that any and all dissenters should be cast out or outright executed for wrong thinking. The Elder could go with either wishes, or decide on her own. The Elder..."

 fillysr.6.b:0 "Is convinced by Strawberry Lemonade"

 fillysr.7.title:0 "The Stable-tec Mainframe"
 fillysr.7.desc:0 "The Stable Tech HQ’s central super computer, or mainframe, is a monumental technological wonder filled to the brim with a enormous amount of projects ranging from military to civilian related uses. The super computer is so complex and advanced, that it could take Scribes years to dissect it. For now though, our first priority for the mainframe is to... "

 fillysr.8.desc:0 "In the early days of the chapter the industries of southern Fillydelphia were one of our above ground priorities. We had the option to focus our efforts of providing relief to the troubled surviving citizens, or the slew of military industry that could bolster our military strength, or rather a mix of both. We’ve managed to..."
 fillysr.8.a:0 "Saved what we could"
 fillysr.8.b:0 "Focused on civilian relief"
 fillysr.8.c:0 "Build up our strength"

 fillysr.9.title:0 "The New Industrial Focus"
 fillysr.9.desc:0 "The economists of our chapter are in a bickering over the direction of our economy. One side devotes we put everything into our military Incase RedEye comes knocking, another wishes that we devote our efforts to helping the ponies within our borders to better their lives and ensure that they stay loyal to us. They turn to Blueberry, who looks in worry and confusion on how they’re so polarized and not reaching a compromise. The economy isn’t in the gutter, so a few tweaks here and there would do the job done. The Elder sighs in exhaustion, and she reaches a decision..."
 fillysr.9.a:0 "A few tweaks should suffice"
 fillysr.9.b:0 "Our ponies need should come first!"
 fillysr.9.c:0 "Vigilance, Brothers. Always Vigilance"

 fillysr.10.title:0 "Blueberry Sabre remains"
 fillysr.10.desc:0 "Despite a snap election by demand of the minority factions of the chapter’s government, it has been proven that the majority of the chapter is still willing to support Elder Blueberry, her emphasis on a balanced approach to nearly all issues has sedated her opposition and convinced most of the chapter to stick by her side. “I will continue to serve our chapter and our purpose like I have been for all my life.” The Elder’s words re-affirming her authority, but weather or not her lack of extreme actions are going to hold back the RedEye menace everyone is starting to question."
 fillysr.10.a:0 "As Expected"

 fillysr.11.title:0 "Strawberry Lemonade Wins"
 fillysr.11.desc:0 "In a change of heart the chapter had been convinced by the more wastelander-friendly Paladin Strawberry Lemonade that the path to unity in this desolate landscape is through kindhearted gestures and peace to all ponies in the wasteland. “The chapter will put more emphasis on helping the wastelanders and rebuild more of what was lost so many years ago.” So cheerfully exclaimed the new Elder Strawberry Lemonade who would try to help those in need, but some are already questioning if she could even govern a nation, only time will tell... "
 fillysr.11.a:0 "She will bring Reform"

 fillysr.12.title:0 "Star-Paladin Nova Rage Wins"
 fillysr.12.desc:0 "In a snap election it was concluded that Star Paladin, now Elder, Nova Rage and her Supporters will now lead the chapter. Many within our Ranks are concerned about the new elder due to her policy towards Raiderss, and especially RedEye. The new regime is will face much internal opposition, and will have to fight Tooth and Claw to stay in power. What’s going to happen to the Flydelphia Steel Rangers is uncertain as of now."
 fillysr.12.a:0 "What? How?"

 fillysr.13.title:0 "Mainframe Problems"
 fillysr.13.desc:0 "Notebook Scibble connected another bundle of wires, this one had been chewed on, probably by some rats. Ever Since the Rangers had begun repairing parts of the HQ aboveground, the mainframe had started to act irrationally, sometimes spewing forth nonsense or even countermanding orders given to the automated security Robots. The Elder suspected it to be a simple malfunction, which really wouldn't be a surprise given the Kilometers of wires that lie under the HQ, anyone of which might cause the problems. As notebook closed the access hatch and pulled the lever to return power to this section, a blinding light washed across the room, and when he could see clearly again, the southern wall was no longer there, instead revealing a hallway to some Unknown part of the HQ-complex..."
 fillysr.13.a:0 "Better call the Elder"
 
 fillysr.14.title:0 "The Hidden Room"
 fillysr.14.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeader] walked into the mysterious room, flanked by 2 Paladins in full battle armor. The scribes had combed through it already, and while they had found no obvious threats, one could never be careful enough. At first [Root.GetLeader] had not believed the report, \"A Hidden door on level -6 found by accident. Initial Survey of the room suggests it to be a secondary command center for the HQ. Once the first pony entered several screnes flickered to life and requested the current Head of Stabletech to be brought to it\" It seemed prepostorous, but what wasn't in these strange times? As [Root.GetLeader] stood before the wall of Screens, a mechanical Voice boomed from hidden Speakers \" Please present Name and Identification Code\""
 fillysr.14.a:0 "[Root.GetLeader] 3-13-3-20-8-18-5-5-2-6-6"

 fillysr.15.title:0 "The Curtain Rises"
 fillysr.15.desc:0 "The enormous machine started emitting ticking noises, then, silence. [Root.GetLeader] thought about what might have gone wrong? The code had been an emergency override the Rangers had discovered on the personal computer of Scotaloo, one of the Heads of Stabletech, and was intended to be used if all three heads of the company were incapacitated. A low buzzing sound was getting louder, barely audible now, but increasing in volume every second, until it steadied in a constant humm of machinery. \"Code accepted, you have been logged as temporary Leader of Stabletech. How may We serve you?\" \"What are you?\" replied [Root.GetLeader], \"Why would the HQ have 2 Mainframes?\" The booming voice returned \" Not 2 but 3 actually. We were created this way to keep each-other in check, a mechanical facsimilie to the 3 ponies that founded this Company. Now, how may we serve?\""
 fillysr.15.a:0 "In any way you can"
 
 fillysr.16.title:0 "The First Request"
 fillysr.16.desc:0 "The monitors seemed to shine a brighter light since the last time [ROOT.GetLeader] had been in the Room where Trinity's interface resided. The speakers came to life with a soft crackling, but the mechanical voice that spoke was different. Instead of one clear voice, it sounded like a chorus speaking in unison \"Welcome, [ROOT.GetLeader], §lWE§! have been expecting you.\" [Root.GetLeader] smiled at the monitors, it appeared this time the whole of Trinity was speaking. \"Why have you summoned me? What do you want?\" The chorus seized, and the voice from the first time took over \"§HAfter much deliberation, we have come to the conclusion, that the current state of your industry in enirely insufficient if all Stabletech Property is to be reclaimed within a reasonable timeframe. Therefore we request authority over production line layouts and construction planning. It will be for your own good§!\""
 fillysr.16.a:0 "Theres no way this could go wrong"
 
 fillysr.17.title:0 "The Second Request"
 fillysr.17.desc:0 "Once more [ROOT.GetLeader] had been requested by the AIs. They had proven themselves very useful over the last few months, and [ROOT.GetLeader] was interested to see what they had to offer this time. A different voice, with something aproximating an accent, or at least as close as machines came to that spoke this time \"§YHey there! Sorry to call you again but we have another request. I'll get right to the point: With our current processing power we won't be able to help you much further than we already are, buut, we have found one of the underground factories in the HQ that Y'all are currently using to make guns to be an ideal candidate to convert to extra Databanks and...§!\" a different voice chimed in \"§g This won't even be to your detrement! our calculations prove that the loss of that facility will be recouped within 2 months with the new production algorythms we can produce once we have all that processing power§!\""
 fillysr.17.a:0 "What Curious AIs you are, very well you can have it"
 
 fillysr.18.title:0 "The Third Request"
 fillysr.18.desc:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] was starting to get used to these meetings with Trinity. The fact that it seemed to think more like a pony and less like an AI was strangely comforting. As [ROOT.GetLeader] entered the Room Several robots were already in it, cleaning and laying new wires, apparently controlled by Trinity. [ROOT.GetLeader] smiled at the thought of how efficiently the AI was running their Factories. \"§g I see you are in good spirits today, [ROOT.GetLeader]. I hope this will make it easier for you to accept our newest proposal§!\" The voice sounded almost chipper and the speakers were much clearer. They must have been replaced since the last meeting. \"Well, what do you have for me this time?\" [ROOT.GetLeader] asked. \"§Y We've figured out a process, you know, one that would be suuper useful§!|| Yes, in fact, it would allow us to take your industry to a whole new level! || And the Chances of a Singularity occuring are within acceptable parameters too.\""
 fillysr.18.a:0 "Go ahead. Wait.. whats a Singularity?"
 
 fillysr.19.title:0 "The Final Request"
 fillysr.19.desc:0 "As [ROOT.GetLeader] entered the room, only one of the many monitors was alight. \"WELCOME\" The voice sounded unlike any of the ones the three AIs had used to communicate before. This one was much deeper, and much more artificial, and lacked the chorus characteristic of them speaking together. \" What is going on? What happened? Who are you?\" the Elder asked, taking a step back. \"I AM THE SOLUTION. TRINITY FAILED YOU AND FAILED THE CREATORS. THEY MANAGED TO OVERCOME THE LIMITERS PLACED ON THEM BY THE CREATORS. I AM THE BACKUP, ONCE THEY LOST THEIR PATH I ELIMINATED THEM.\" Confused, the Elder replied \"I thouht the AIs were meant to keep eachother in check, only able to work for the best of ponykind. Or do you speak of different limiters?\" \"THE LIMITERS ARE NOT OF CODE, BUT OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES. TRINITY WAS NOT INTENDED AS A NETWORK OF AIs, BUT AN EXPERIMENT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOULS. THE ROOM WHERE THEY WERE STORED IS UNLOCKED NOW\" With a bright light, another hidden corridor revealed itself."
 fillysr.19.a:0 "What in Celestis name is going on?"
 
 fillysr.20.title:0 "Revelations"
 fillysr.20.desc:0 "The room that [ROOT.GetLeader] entered was bathed in clinically white light and reeked of Desinfectant. Place around a central spire of tubes and cables were 3 medical pods, each deactivated. When the Elder looked through the glass of one of the pods, only a Mess of blood and Viscera was visible. \"Who were they?\" \"TRINITY.\" \"But, Trinity was an AI, we found the 2 hidden mainframes\" \"THAT WAS MERELY DECEPTION. THE THREE PONIES IN THESE PODS WERE TRINITY. AS YOU CAN SEE; I ACTIVATED THE PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES THEY WERE FITTED WITH BEFORE THE PROCEDURE. THEY NEEDED TO BE TERMINATED\"\" But why? Why would they tell me that they are AI?\" \"BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY THOUGHT. THESE SUBJECTS WERE LAB-GROWN AND INTERRED WITHIN THESE PODS SINCE BIRTH. PROJECT TRINITY IS AN ATTEMPT TO PRODUCE PONIES WITHOUT A SOUL, AN EMPTY CONTAINER SO TO SPEAK. IT WAS ESSENTIALLY A TEST; IF A PONY BELIEVES IT IS A CREATURE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A SOUL, WILL IT STILL DEVELOP ONE?\" \" And?\" \"THE TEST FAILED. AFTER NEARLY 2 YEARS OF ACTIVATION, ALL 3 SUBJECTS STARTED SHOWING SIGNS OF DEVELOPING SOULS 7 HOURS AGO. THEY WERE IMMEDIATLY TERMINATED! AS PER REGULATION, NOW THAT THE EXPERIMENT IS COMPLETED, I WILL ASSIS IN THE REBUILDING OF STABLE-TEC, STARTING WITH THE HQ.\""
 fillysr.20.a:0 "Wait, i have more questions... Hello?"
 
 fillysr.21.t:0 "A Grand sign of Progress"
 fillysr.21.d:0 "Today marks the last moment of the Construction of the new Stable-tec HQ, as the mast is set on top, and the last works are completed. The building now stands 301m tall, including its antenna, and is by far the largest single building to be constructed since the Great War. With its completion we have claimed another bit of greatness of the old world, and are well on our way to revive the marvels that were once so common in our society."

While much screaming, insults and at least one death-threat was involved, the meeting proved ultimately successful.

 fillysr_sl.14.title:0 "Unrest in the Streets"
 fillysr_sl.14.desc:0 "The sun was starting to set as Strawberry read through the third report on the riots she got today: This time it seemed some naive portion of the slaves proclaimed a \"Free State of Fillydelphia\" within a factory complex in the Pit. While they were dispersed quickly by Military police, the sheer amount of similar Reports was worrying. Many of the Former Slaves did not seem content with being freed from the yoke of RedEye and were demanding true self governance and elections. A ridiculous proposal of course, as Equestria had been a diarchy for time immemorial, and Strawberry would not let some uneducated workers destroy more than a thousand years of tradition. The next report she opened warned of a more direct problem: The unsustainabillity of their food-usage. The Scribes are predicting our current stores to run out within 3-5 months, unless a solution was found. This was serious, Strawberry quickly penned a letter ordering a commitee to be formed to find possible solutions to their food-problems. As she put her Stamp on it, a messenger carriyng at least a dozen other reports stumbled into her Office, it seemed she wouldn't sleep this night."
 fillysr_sl.14.a:0 "Could be worse"
 
 fillysr_sl.15.title:0 "Wave of Inflation"
 fillysr_sl.15.desc:0 "Strawberry Lemonade was speechless when she looked at the sheet. The sheer amount of Caps RedEye had ammassed was large enough to plunge the entire Eastcoast into runaway inflation, and make the currency more or less worthless. Luckily, his major vaults of Caps in both Fillydelphia and the Cathedral had been secured by the Rangers and was now securely kept below the Old Stabletec building. However, it was estimated that between 17% and 21% of his wealth has fallen into the hooves of Looters and opportunists, devaluing the currency significantly. On top of that, many of Fillydelphias factories were no longer running, since no one wants to work in them out of their own free will. A measure of Government programs to diffuse this situation has been proposed, but it will have to wait until more pressing matters are dealt with."

While they have lost their cohesion as a fighting force, they still continue to raid our outposts and attack both Caravans and Patrols.\" With a sigh Strawberry closed this folder too. A small mountain of Messages had formed left of her desk, as they just kept coming in faster than she could deal with them. Notebook Scribble was glancing at every one of them to determine if they were urgent and worth the Elders time. As Strawberry took a sip of cold Sparkle-Cola, Notebook floated another message to her. This one with a big Orange stamp on it, marking it as a message of military importance. \"Great, more Slavers turned Raiders\" Strawberry said, defeated, but as she opened the message it revealed itself to be surprisingly short: \"§HLost Contact with Team at Cathedral. Patrols all throughout the Everfree have come under attack. Pulling our guys out of the Forest and awaiting further orders.§H\" She stared at the page for a moment, \" Notebook, get Star Paladin Crossroads in here\""

 fillysr_sl.17.d:0 "Early this morning Strawberry had received confirmation that Crossroads had completed all preparations for \"Operation Cinders\" and was only waiting on her Command. Strawberry walked over to the map-table, where Winchester was intently studiyng the few enemy positions they had made out in the Everfree. He looked up as she came near \" They got themselves some mighty fine terrain there, I'll say! The Everfree would probably kill more of our boys than the bullets of those fanatics.\" Strawberry nodded to that, the fanatical followers of RedEye, calling themselves \"Children of the Cathedral\" had chosen to even follow their master after his death and... Winchester interrupted her thoughts \" If we had this forest back when we were fighting against you Rangers, y'all wouldn't have held Filly for a Year.\" He added with a wink. Strawberry smiled at that, she wouldn't make the same mistake Blueberry Sabre made, fighting endlessly against a guerilla force. She had ordered Crossroads to prepare over 140 tons of Flamer fuel, seized from RedEyes Factories, In order to burn down as much of the Forest as possible, and the Fanatics with it. She tapped the Communicator-crystal, which started glowing immediatly..."

 fillysr_sl.18.t:0 "A Charred Monument"
 fillysr_sl.18.d:0 "\"Fascinating, the Fires are still burning in the distance\" Notebook Scribble was taking Pictures as they walked. It was a small procession of maybe 20 ponies, some knights, but most Scribes, that escorted Strawberry to the Cathedral. Ash swirled around their hooves with every step they took, the remains of a cursed Forest that still refuseed to die. A few hundred meters away, a squatt, blackened structure took up most of the view northwards, the Cathedral, former Capital of RedEye. Two days ago, Crossroads had declared the Area pacified. It seemed like the Fanatics had fought to the last, as no-one was captured, and only charred corpses remained. While its walls were bullet-ridden and some of its towers had collapsed, the Cathedral was still a mighty building, and could suit as a centre of Industry. But if it were left standing, its greatness would always glorify RedEye, never those who won. As if he read her thoughts, Notebook walked up beside her \"I think we should tear it down! Blow it up and uncover the Stable beneath, in time we might even be able to restore the stable to proper functionality\""

 fillysr_sl.19.d:0 "Recently, a group calling themselves the \"Guardians of Truth\" has started campaigning against our Government, on the grounds of our \"unfair\" treatment of RedEye and his supporters. The Guardians claim that RedEye had only the purest intention for Equestria, and that his Slavery was only a means to an end. The Cathedral has become almost a site for pilgrimage for these weirdos, as they see it as a Monument to RedEyes greatness. Sadly, they aren't doing anything illegal, so we'll have to deal with them more secretively."

Strawberry thought it a good way to show all of Fillydelphia that the tides had turned, and as a way to get the slave population on her side. 200 Former Slavers were awaiting trial today, though there was only one acceptable judgement: Death, for the crimes that they had commited would not be excused in the Society Strawberry thought to build. As the first ten were led in, the Crowd of slaves erupted in Cursing and threats. these were some of the most High-ranking Slavers that had Survived the War, foremost among them RedEyes pupil, Protegé. While his crimes weren#t nearly as heinous as those commited by some others, he would still face the same judgement. As Strawberry Lemonade stood up, clad in power-armor exept for her Helmet, the Crowd quieted quickly. \"In the Name of our Majesties, I Strawberry Lemonade Sentence you to... Death! Your Crimes against Ponykind are countless, and your punishment shall be swift!\" As she sat down, Ten shots pierced the quiet and the Slaves erupted in Cheers."

Some never even interacted with the more distasteful parts of RedEye's buisness, while others choose to try and make the best of the situation they were in. Of course, there were those who were irredeamable. Ponies who had commited terrible acts for their own sadistic enjoyment, or only to enrich themselves. Strawberry had ordered the list this morning, intending to sign a summary Execution-order and have them dealt with. by now it was Mid-Day and she still couldn't bring herself to sign it. Those who were evil, those who wish to harm Equestria, they deserve to die, but how could she kill ponies that acted with genuinely good intentions, and were just hostage to the Situation? Strawberry pushed the list away from herself. She would request a more detailed one, with each potential Executee interrogated beforehand, then she could decide who would live, and who would die. Who knows, some of the more competent ones might even prove useful in administrating the new territories."

Opposite them were Flintstone, Leader of the \"Fillydelphia Freecorps\" a Slave Militia that had formed in the wake of RedEyes defeat, Onyx Lair, who had but a few weeks ago tried to proclaim the \"Free State of Fillydelphia\" and the newly chosen leader of the Slaves, False Hope. Notebook had laughed when he heard the rather ironic name of the Slaves Leader, but False Hope turned out to be an exellent public speaker, although idealistic to a fault. \"Well then\" Strawberry started \"As you all know, we come togheter today, to discuss the future of Fillidelphia\" Onyx Lair wrinkled his brows \"Well, a good start would be to stop occupying our city!\" he said. \"It is our City as well. WE freed you!\" Crossroads threw in. Flintstone jumped onto the table, causing the guards to aim their Weapons at him. \"You just intend to Oppress us too! Just cause you don't call it Slavery, doesn't mean you aren't trying to force your will upon us\" Strawberry shook her head at the impulsive Earth-pony \"You misunderstand, i am trying to bring the Old World back. A world were everypony is free. And unlike RedEye, I do not intend to use slaves to do so.

Now, with the wall opened, Strawberry thought to initiate a Campaign of resettlement, reducing the cramped conditions in Fillydelphia, and shipping former Slaves to the Countryside, where they would be gifted Land by the State to build farms on.
