While they were dispersed quickly by Military police, the sheer amount of similar Reports was worrying. Many of the Former Slaves did not seem content with being freed from the yoke of RedEye and were demanding true self governance and elections. A ridiculous proposal of course, as Equestria had been a diarchy for time immemorial, and Strawberry would not let some uneducated workers destroy more than a thousand years of tradition. The next report she opened warned of a more direct problem: The unsustainabillity of their food-usage. The Scribes are predicting our current stores to run out within 3-5 months, unless a solution was found. This was serious, Strawberry quickly penned a letter ordering a commitee to be formed to find possible solutions to their food-problems. As she put her Stamp on it, a messenger carriyng at least a dozen other reports stumbled into her Office, it seemed she wouldn't sleep this night."

The sheer amount of Caps RedEye had ammassed was large enough to plunge the entire Eastcoast into runaway inflation, and make the currency more or less worthless. Luckily, his major vaults of Caps in both Fillydelphia and the Cathedral had been secured by the Rangers and was now securely kept below the Old Stabletec building. However, it was estimated that between 17% and 21% of his wealth has fallen into the hooves of Looters and opportunists, devaluing the currency significantly. On top of that, many of Fillydelphias factories were no longer running, since no one wants to work in them out of their own free will. A measure of Government programs to diffuse this situation has been proposed, but it will have to wait until more pressing matters are dealt with."

Notebook Scribble was glancing at every one of them to determine if they were urgent and worth the Elders time. As Strawberry took a sip of cold Sparkle-Cola, Notebook floated another message to her. This one with a big Orange stamp on it, marking it as a message of military importance. \"Great, more Slavers turned Raiders\" Strawberry said, defeated, but as she opened the message it revealed itself to be surprisingly short: \"§HLost Contact with Team at Cathedral.

A few hundred meters away, a squatt, blackened structure took up most of the view northwards, the Cathedral, former Capital of RedEye. Two days ago, Crossroads had declared the Area pacified. It seemed like the Fanatics had fought to the last, as no-one was captured, and only charred corpses remained. While its walls were bullet-ridden and some of its towers had collapsed, the Cathedral was still a mighty building, and could suit as a centre of Industry. But if it were left standing, its greatness would always glorify RedEye, never those who won. As if he read her thoughts, Notebook walked up beside her \"I think we should tear it down! Blow it up and uncover the Stable beneath, in time we might even be able to restore the stable to proper functionality\""

 fillysr_sl.19.d:0 "Recently, a group calling themselves the \"Guardians of Truth\" has started campaigning against our Government, on the grounds of our \"unfair\" treatment of RedEye and his supporters. The Guardians claim that RedEye had only the purest intention for Equestria, and that his Slavery was only a means to an end. The Cathedral has become almost a site for pilgrimage for these weirdos, as they see it as a Monument to RedEyes greatness. Sadly, they aren't doing anything illegal, so we'll have to deal with them more secretively."

 fillysr_sl.22.d:0 "The trials were to be held in the Arena, where once RedEye had forced slaves to fight one another. Strawberry thought it a good way to show all of Fillydelphia that the tides had turned, and as a way to get the slave population on her side. 200 Former Slavers were awaiting trial today, though there was only one acceptable judgement: Death, for the crimes that they had commited would not be excused in the Society Strawberry thought to build. As the first ten were led in, the Crowd of slaves erupted in Cursing and threats. these were some of the most High-ranking Slavers that had Survived the War, foremost among them RedEyes pupil, Protegé. While his crimes weren#t nearly as heinous as those commited by some others, he would still face the same judgement. As Strawberry Lemonade stood up, clad in power-armor exept for her Helmet, the Crowd quieted quickly. \"In the Name of our Majesties, I Strawberry Lemonade Sentence you to... Death! Your Crimes against Ponykind are countless, and your punishment shall be swift!\" As she sat down, Ten shots pierced the quiet and the Slaves erupted in Cheers."

 fillysr_sl.23.d:0 "Strawberry stared at the list lying on the table in front of her. It held the Names of 200 Ponies who supported and worked for RedEye, all having some manner of authority in his Organization. They had been enemies, but not all of them were evil. Some never even interacted with the more distasteful parts of RedEye's buisness, while others choose to try and make the best of the situation they were in. Of course, there were those who were irredeamable. Ponies who had commited terrible acts for their own sadistic enjoyment, or only to enrich themselves. Strawberry had ordered the list this morning, intending to sign a summary Execution-order and have them dealt with. by now it was Mid-Day and she still couldn't bring herself to sign it. Those who were evil, those who wish to harm Equestria, they deserve to die, but how could she kill ponies that acted with genuinely good intentions, and were just hostage to the Situation? Strawberry pushed the list away from herself. She would request a more detailed one, with each potential Executee interrogated beforehand, then she could decide who would live, and who would die. Who knows, some of the more competent ones might even prove useful in administrating the new territories."

Opposite them were Flintstone, Leader of the \"Fillydelphia Freecorps\" a Slave Militia that had formed in the wake of RedEyes defeat, Onyx Lair, who had but a few weeks ago tried to proclaim the \"Free State of Fillydelphia\" and the newly chosen leader of the Slaves, False Hope. Notebook had laughed when he heard the rather ironic name of the Slaves Leader, but False Hope turned out to be an exellent public speaker, although idealistic to a fault. \"Well then\" Strawberry started \"As you all know, we come togheter today, to discuss the future of Fillidelphia\" Onyx Lair wrinkled his brows \"Well, a good start would be to stop occupying our city!\" he said. \"It is our City as well. WE freed you!\" Crossroads threw in. Flintstone jumped onto the table, causing the guards to aim their Weapons at him. \"You just intend to Oppress us too! Just cause you don't call it Slavery, doesn't mean you aren't trying to force your will upon us\" Strawberry shook her head at the impulsive Earth-pony \"You misunderstand, i am trying to bring the Old World back. A world were everypony is free. And unlike RedEye, I do not intend to use slaves to do so. Please, help me make that dream come true\" After a moment of Silence False Hope finally spoke up \"I think we should give them a chance\""

If this actually gets the former Slaves to cooperate, it wouldn't be a large Sacrifice."

I am leading these ones\" She gestured towards the assembled griffons. \"My name is Ragini\" Strawberry nodded \"So you took over the Talons after Sterns Death? How many are there?\" Ragini seemed to get a bit smaller at that question \"These Thirty are the only combat-ready ones I have left, another 80 or so not fit for battle. Many fled when they got word of Sterns Death, we are not what we used to be\" She drew herself up to her full height \"But we are still exellent fighters!

Insignia and Propaganda of RedEye had been carefully removed, erasing any trace of his Rule. The New opening in the wall would be called \"Crossroads Gate\" In honour of the Star paladin who first breached the wall with her Squad. Now, with the wall opened, Strawberry wishes to initiate a Campaign of resettlement, reducing the cramped conditions in Fillydelphia, and shipping former Slaves to the Countryside, where they would be gifted Land by the State to build farms on. This would hopefully have the effect of increasing food production, and staving of famine."

Our projections were for this to be a 10-year plan of resettlement, but its moving much faster than anticipated, due to private Entrepeneurs looking for their luck in the open lands of the West.

Another Deep breath, as she heard notebook announce her, then she walked onto the Stage. A Sea of ponies stretched before her, foals riding on their parents backs to see the Pony that had promised them a better life. Strawberry held her head high as she walked towards the podium that held the microphone. After what seemed like and eternity she arrived there, took one last, deep breath, and began her speech \"Citizens of Fillydelphia, my brothers and sisters, Long have you suffered, long have you bled, long did you have to fear your Future. But today, our future looks bright! Together we have overcome Obstacles none of us dreamed to cross, and defeated an Evil that seemed unstoppable. For that I thank you!\" A wave of applause washed over her, some ponies calling her name. \"But, our work is not yet done! Fillydelphia is free, but Equestria is not. I would not dream of claiming to be the Ruler of this new Eqeastria, as that is a priviledge only our Majesties Celestia and Luna can claim. But, in their absence, i shall become a Regent for this nation, so that I may hand it over to them once they Return in Glory!\" Applause swelled up, but Strawberry didn't stop talking. \"Today, the Steel Rangers Cease to be as a Nation, for we are The Equestrian Reclamation Front!

The main 6 Demands of the former Slaves were enshrined first, as to appease them. After that, A rule naming Strawberry Lemonade as Grand Regent of Equestria for life was added, to make clear that full democracy was not in the cards. A claim to all Lands of Ponykind was added, to legitimize the Conquest of all land owned by old Equestria, and really any other Land if you stretched the definition far enough. After that, many more ideas were thrown around, but none were deemed universal enough to be included. However, False Hope proposed, that the Constitution could be malleable and amended in the future. For now it is only a document that affirms our authority, but who knows what it might grow into..."
