 fillysr.13.desc:0 "Notebook Scibble connected another bundle of wires, this one had been chewed on, probably by some rats. Ever Since the Rangers had begun repairing parts of the HQ aboveground, the mainframe had started to act irrationally, sometimes spewing forth nonsense or even countermanding orders given to the automated security Robots. The Elder suspected it to be a simple malfunction, which really wouldn't be a surprise given the Kilometers of wires that lie under the HQ, anyone of which might cause the problems. As notebook closed the access hatch and pulled the lever to return power to this section, a blinding light washed across the room, and when he could see clearly again, the southern wall was no longer there, instead revealing a hallway to some Unknown part of the HQ-complex..."

 fillysr.14.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeader] walked into the mysterious room, flanked by 2 Paladins in full battle armor. The scribes had combed through it already, and while they had found no obvious threats, one could never be careful enough. At first [Root.GetLeader] had not believed the report, \"A Hidden door on level -6 found by accident. Initial Survey of the room suggests it to be a secondary command center for the HQ. Once the first pony entered several screnes flickered to life and requested the current Head of Stabletech to be brought to it\" It seemed prepostorous, but what wasn't in these strange times? As [Root.GetLeader] stood before the wall of Screens, a mechanical Voice boomed from hidden Speakers \" Please present Name and Identification Code\""

The code had been an emergency override the Rangers had discovered on the personal computer of Scotaloo, one of the Heads of Stabletech, and was intended to be used if all three heads of the company were incapacitated. A low buzzing sound was getting louder, barely audible now, but increasing in volume every second, until it steadied in a constant humm of machinery. \"Code accepted, you have been logged as temporary Leader of Stabletech. How may We serve you?\" \"What are you?\" replied [Root.GetLeader], \"Why would the HQ have 2 Mainframes?\" The booming voice returned \" Not 2 but 3 actually. We were created this way to keep each-other in check, a mechanical facsimilie to the 3 ponies that founded this Company. Now, how may we serve?\""

 fillysr.16.title:0 "The First Request"
 fillysr.16.desc:0 "The monitors seemed to shine a brighter light since the last time [ROOT.GetLeader] had been in the Room where Trinity's interface resided. The speakers came to life with a soft crackling, but the mechanical voice that spoke was different. Instead of one clear voice, it sounded like a chorus speaking in unison \"Welcome, [ROOT.GetLeader], §lWE§! have been expecting you.\" [Root.GetLeader] smiled at the monitors, it appeared this time the whole of Trinity was speaking. \"Why have you summoned me? What do you want?\" The chorus seized, and the voice from the first time took over \"§HAfter much deliberation, we have come to the conclusion, that the current state of your industry in enirely insufficient if all Stabletech Property is to be reclaimed within a reasonable timeframe. Therefore we request authority over production line layouts and construction planning. It will be for your own good§!\""

 fillysr.17.title:0 "The Second Request"
 fillysr.17.desc:0 "Once more [ROOT.GetLeader] had been requested by the AIs. They had proven themselves very useful over the last few months, and [ROOT.GetLeader] was interested to see what they had to offer this time. A different voice, with something aproximating an accent, or at least as close as machines came to that spoke this time \"§YHey there! Sorry to call you again but we have another request. I'll get right to the point: With our current processing power we won't be able to help you much further than we already are, buut, we have found one of the underground factories in the HQ that Y'all are currently using to make guns to be an ideal candidate to convert to extra Databanks and...§!\" a different voice chimed in \"§g This won't even be to your detrement! our calculations prove that the loss of that facility will be recouped within 2 months with the new production algorythms we can produce once we have all that processing power§!\""
 fillysr.17.a:0 "What Curious AIs you are, very well you can have it"
 
 fillysr.18.title:0 "The Third Request"
 fillysr.18.desc:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] was starting to get used to these meetings with Trinity. The fact that it seemed to think more like a pony and less like an AI was strangely comforting. As [ROOT.GetLeader] entered the Room Several robots were already in it, cleaning and laying new wires, apparently controlled by Trinity. [ROOT.GetLeader] smiled at the thought of how efficiently the AI was running their Factories. \"§g I see you are in good spirits today, [ROOT.GetLeader]. I hope this will make it easier for you to accept our newest proposal§!\" The voice sounded almost chipper and the speakers were much clearer. They must have been replaced since the last meeting. \"Well, what do you have for me this time?\" [ROOT.GetLeader] asked. \"§Y We've figured out a process, you know, one that would be suuper useful§!|| Yes, in fact, it would allow us to take your industry to a whole new level! || And the Chances of a Singularity occuring are within acceptable parameters too.\""
 fillysr.18.a:0 "Go ahead. Wait.. whats a Singularity?"
 
 fillysr.19.title:0 "The Final Request"
 fillysr.19.desc:0 "As [ROOT.GetLeader] entered the room, only one of the many monitors was alight. \"WELCOME\" The voice sounded unlike any of the ones the three AIs had used to communicate before. This one was much deeper, and much more artificial, and lacked the chorus characteristic of them speaking together. \" What is going on? What happened? Who are you?\" the Elder asked, taking a step back. \"I AM THE SOLUTION. TRINITY FAILED YOU AND FAILED THE CREATORS. THEY MANAGED TO OVERCOME THE LIMITERS PLACED ON THEM BY THE CREATORS. I AM THE BACKUP, ONCE THEY LOST THEIR PATH I ELIMINATED THEM.\" Confused, the Elder replied \"I thouht the AIs were meant to keep eachother in check, only able to work for the best of ponykind. Or do you speak of different limiters?\" \"THE LIMITERS ARE NOT OF CODE, BUT OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES. TRINITY WAS NOT INTENDED AS A NETWORK OF AIs, BUT AN EXPERIMENT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOULS. THE ROOM WHERE THEY WERE STORED IS UNLOCKED NOW\" With a bright light, another hidden corridor revealed itself."

Place around a central spire of tubes and cables were 3 medical pods, each deactivated. When the Elder looked through the glass of one of the pods, only a Mess of blood and Viscera was visible. \"Who were they?\" \"TRINITY.\" \"But, Trinity was an AI, we found the 2 hidden mainframes\" \"THAT WAS MERELY DECEPTION. THE THREE PONIES IN THESE PODS WERE TRINITY. AS YOU CAN SEE; I ACTIVATED THE PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES THEY WERE FITTED WITH BEFORE THE PROCEDURE. THEY NEEDED TO BE TERMINATED\"\" But why? Why would they tell me that they are AI?\" \"BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY THOUGHT. THESE SUBJECTS WERE LAB-GROWN AND INTERRED WITHIN THESE PODS SINCE BIRTH. PROJECT TRINITY IS AN ATTEMPT TO PRODUCE PONIES WITHOUT A SOUL, AN EMPTY CONTAINER SO TO SPEAK. IT WAS ESSENTIALLY A TEST; IF A PONY BELIEVES IT IS A CREATURE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A SOUL, WILL IT STILL DEVELOP ONE?\" \" And?\" \"THE TEST FAILED. AFTER NEARLY 2 YEARS OF ACTIVATION, ALL 3 SUBJECTS STARTED SHOWING SIGNS OF DEVELOPING SOULS 7 HOURS AGO. THEY WERE IMMEDIATLY TERMINATED! AS PER REGULATION, NOW THAT THE EXPERIMENT IS COMPLETED, I WILL ASSIS IN THE REBUILDING OF STABLE-TEC, STARTING WITH THE HQ.\""
