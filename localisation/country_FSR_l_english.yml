 FSR_newindustry:0 "Fillydelphia's Industry"
 FSR_newindustry_desc:0 "While most of Fillydelphia's industry lies In Red Eye's territory to the north, the southern side under our control is still worth our time. Before the War, many great titans of industry were located in Fillydelphia, first amongst them Stable-Tec. We shall reclaim that former greatness!"
 
 FSR_out_docks:0 "Outskirts Dockyards"
 FSR_out_docks_desc:0 "The Equestrian Navy has de-facto ceased to exist, only pirates and fools roam the seas and rivers. The Elder has authorized the remaining shipyards to be repaired and put to use so that we might restore the navy in time."
 
 FSR_filly_pumps:0 "Fillybanks Waterpumps"
 FSR_filly_pumps_desc:0 "Unlike most of the Wasteland, the Steel Rangers still have the capabilities for large-scale water purification. With our population growing and our industry thirsty for resources, we will apply said knowledge via a new facility on the south bank"
 
 FSR_down_rennovation:0 "South End Rennovations"
 FSR_down_rennovation_desc:0 "Now that South End is cleared of resistance, we can renovate some of the infrastructure and industry that has laid in ruins for far too long. This is but the first step towards pre-war industry returning."
 
 FSR_hq_touchup:0 "Patch Up HQ"
 FSR_hq_touchup_desc:0 "For 200 Years, the Steel Rangers of Fillydelphia have called the bunkers and tunnels beneath Stable-Tec HQ their home. We have taken good care of them, but the parts of the HQ that lie above ground are little more than rubble. Still, there are powerlines that can be fixed, and at least the first 2 floors can be feasibly rebuilt without too much effort."
 
 FSR_consumer_circuitry:0 "Salvage Consumer Electronics"
 FSR_consumer_circuitry_desc:0 "During the War, Fillydelphia was a centre of research and electronics-manufacturing. Many a factory and shop still lie untouched, due to being guarded by robotic sentries, still doing their duty after 200 years."
 
 FSR_rebuild_robco:0 "Rebuild Robronco"
 FSR_rebuild_robco_desc:0 "Robronco was one of, if not the, largest Equestrian robotics company during the War. While they originally produced mostly civilian robots, they quickly started churning out legions of protectaponies and similar creations as the War escalated."
 
 FSR_robotic_servants:0 "Robotic Workers"

 FSR_room_progress:0 "Make Room for Progress"
 FSR_room_progress_desc:0 "We may be one of the biggest industrial powers in the Wasteland, but even we have only reclaimed a tiny fraction of Equestria's former industrial might. If we wish to return to our prime sometime in the future, we'll need to clear away the rubble and build proper roads."
 
 FSR_talk_to_trinity:0 "The First Request"
 FSR_talk_to_trinity_desc:0 "Trinity has called for [ROOT.GetLeader], apparently wishing to make a request."

 FSR_talk_three_trinity:0 "The Third Request"

 FSR_art_factory:0 "Reactivate Artillery Plant"
 FSR_art_factory_desc:0 "After clearing the rubble, Trinity's predictive algorithms all pointed to a specific area of interest. There we discovered a pre-war artillery factory hidden underground. It is still in pristine condition, only waiting for power to be restored to it."
 
 FSR_thousand_gears:0 "A Thousand Gears"
 FSR_thousand_gears_desc:0 "Our industry grows day by day, consuming ever more resources and producing mountains of materiel.

### Navy Tree ###
 
 FSR_surface_navy:0 "A Surface Navy"
 FSR_surface_navy_desc:0 "With our current methods and technology it simply won't be possible to recreate the advanced carriers or submarines that were the backbone of the Equestrian Navy. Instead, we have to think back further, to when men-of-war and galleys were the ultimate naval vessels."
 
 FSR_new_harbor:0 "The New Harbor"
 FSR_new_harbor_desc:0 "Now that we can produce new ships, it is time to refurbish the many docks, both big and small, that lie in the south of Fillydelphia."
 
 FSR_mobile_ships:0 "Mobile Ships"
 FSR_mobile_ships_desc:0 "One of the primary enemies of our new navy will be the numerous pirates that roam the seas and rivers. Since they use primarily small canoes and speedboats, we will have to design our navy to catch up with and eliminate them."
 
 FSR_naval_doctrine:0 "Naval Knowledge"
 FSR_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "The Stable-Tec Maneframe contains 2492 documents pertaining to naval theory, schematics, and tactics. We can study these to gain a deeper understanding of naval warfare and all it entails."
 
 FSR_big_ships:0 "Swimming Behemoths"
 FSR_big_ships_desc:0 "If we wish to compete with current naval powers, we need ships large enough to carry firepower that could flatten a small town. To this end, larger hulls need to be produced and new weapon layouts thought up."
 
 FSR_naval_guns:0 "Naval Batteries"
 FSR_naval_guns_desc:0 "Naval guns are among the largest weapons Equestria produced during the War and are capable of truly awesome destruction. We will need copious amounts of metal, gunpowder, and fuel to field these beasts, but once we have them, our enemies shall quiver with fear."
 
 FSR_waste_navy:0 "A Wasteland Navy"
 FSR_waste_navy_desc:0 "The Wasteland offers little resources, and a fleet of large ships would be a waste. If we focus on smaller, mass-produced vessels instead, we can dominate the seas!"
 
 FSR_war_navy:0 "A Wartime Navy"

 FSR_rule_seas:0 "Rule the Seas"
 FSR_rule_seas_desc:0 "It has taken years of buildup, but our fleet is truly magnificent now! From this day forward, none shall equal us. WE Rule the Seas!"
 
### Army Tree ###
 FSR_srarmy:0 "Steel Ranger Army"
 FSR_srarmy_desc:0 "Since our inception we have been an elite military force. Now, our armies shall dominate the Wasteland!"
 
 FSR_ajarmy:0 "Applejack's New Rangers"

 FSR_healthyarmy:0 "Healthy Soldiers"
 FSR_healthyarmy_desc:0 "One issue has already become apparent with our new military doctrine: casualties are much higher than before. We must take action to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our soldiers. "
 
 FSR_saddlearmy:0 "New Battlesaddles"
 FSR_saddlearmy_desc:0 "Most of our independent battle saddles come from before the War and are designed for small-medium arms. We must develop new ones if we wish to arm our soldiers with larger weaponry."
 
 FSR_futurearmy:0 "Weapons of the Future"
 FSR_futurearmy_desc:0 "Energy weapons were some of the most advanced technology being deployed before the War. By using these weapons, we will gain a sizable advantage over our foes."

 FSR_steellegion:0 "The Steel Legion"

 FSR_roboarmy:0 "Robotic Soldiers"
 FSR_roboarmy_desc:0 "We can increase our militaries effectiveness substantially if we supplement it with automated robotic units."
 
 FSR_trainwastelanders:0 "A Wasteland Doctrine"
 FSR_trainwastelanders_desc:0 "We are still relying on the same old doctrines that have guided our forces since the War. If our army is to change, so too much our doctrine change to match it."

 FSR_priviarmy_desc:0 "Our rangers are the most elite fighting force in the wasteland. We aim to keep it that way."
 
 FSR_stabletecproject:0 "Stable-Tec Construction"
 FSR_stabletecproject_desc:0 "Before the War, Stable-Tec was one of the most innovative companies in Equestria. Their Maneframe is certain to contain all sorts of valuable data. However, everything on it is encrypted. Fortunately for us, our scribes believe they can decrypt it, given the time. "
 
 FSR_superiorarmor:0 "Superior Armour"
 FSR_superiorarmor_desc:0 "Our knights have managed to come up with several ways to improve our power armour manufacturing process, simplifying it and improving the quality of the armor itself."
 
 FSR_assaultweapons:0 "Dedicated Assault Weapons"
 FSR_assaultweapons_desc:0 "High-powered explosives are devastating against lightly armoured infantry. Which just so happens to be most of the rest of the wasteland."
 
 FSR_elitescouts:0 "Elite Scouts"
 FSR_elitescouts_desc:0 "Charging into a battle blind is how you lose lives. We must express caution and deploy scouts to ensure we aren't met with any surprises."
 
 FSR_rangerdoctrine:0 "Ranger Doctrine"
 FSR_rangerdoctrine_desc:0 "For 200 years, power armour has played a crucial role in our military doctrine. Why would we change that now?"
 
 FSR_rangerarmy:0 "A Ranger Army"
 FSR_rangerarmy_desc:0 "Protected by steel, our soldiers march on. They may not be the largest army in the wasteland, but they are certainly the most elite."
 
 FSR_raiderarmy:0 "Raider Auxillaries"
 FSR_raiderarmy_desc:0 "Our armies are severely limited in ponypower. Many raider gangs, displaced by Red Eye, have taken to causing trouble in the local area. Perhaps we can kill two griffons with one stone."
 
 FSR_fortresscity:0 "The Fortress-City"
 FSR_fortresscity_desc:0 "Many question whether or not we could actually defend our headquarters against a sustained attack. We must take action to ensure we are prepared for whatever may come."

 FSR_newdoctrine:0 "The New Doctrine"

 FSR_biggerguns:0 "Bigger Guns"
 FSR_biggerguns_desc:0 "Bigger guns for a bigger army. After all, too much firepower never hurt anypony."
 
 FSR_biggestgun:0 "The Biggest Gun in the Wasteland"
 FSR_biggestgun_desc:0 "Watch as they run for the hills when they witness the size of what we're packing."
 
 FSR_raiderworkshops:0 "Raider Workshops"
 FSR_raiderworkshops_desc:0 "A couple of old factories have been turned into raider dens. Factories we would very much like to have. Perhaps an agreement of sorts can be reached with them."
 
 FSR_raiderdrugs:0 "Raider Drugs"
 FSR_raiderdrugs_desc:0 "Raiders use all sorts of chems for both recreational and combative purposes. However, those many of those chems were originally intended for medical usage."
 
 FSR_raiderpaladins:0 "Raider Paladins"
 FSR_raiderpaladins_desc:0 "They charge forth, a wave of steel straight from Tartarus itself. Perhaps not the most elite force, nor the most proper, but certainly one of the most terrifying."
 
 
### Opening Political Tree ###
 FSR_thescribes:0 "The Scribe's Problems"
 FSR_thescribes_desc:0 "The civilian pillar of our organization, the Scribes have been an institution for centuries. But there are questions about its future..."
 
 FSR_theknights:0 "The Partisan Issue"
 FSR_theknights_desc:0 "We are not alone within this part of Fillydelphia. Many outsiders also inhabit our land, and very few of them share our goals. Conflicts between us and them have led to the formation of a group of so-called 'Partisans', who seek to oppose us at every turn. They present a problem that needs to be dealt with."
 
 FSR_poldivisions:0 "Political Divisions"
 FSR_poldivisions_desc:0 "Many wastelanders and members of our own Chapter have come to question our Mission. The Elder must choose who to listen to, for the future is uncertain."
 
 FSR_stablemainframe:0 "The Stable-Tec Maneframe"
 FSR_stablemainframe_desc:0 "The Maneframe of Stable-Tec is an enigma filled with technological marvels, and we've only just begun to unlock her secrets."
 
 FSR_industriallegacy:0 "Our Industrial Legacy"
 FSR_industriallegacy_desc:0 "Large swaths of southern Fillydelphia are devoted to industries of all kinds, but in the chaos, we could only save some of them."
 
 FSR_industyfocus:0 "The Focus of Our Industry"
 FSR_industyfocus_desc:0 "Our economy is in limbo. With Red Eye breathing down our necks, we're pressured to spare nothing for our civilians and focus only on our military; however, our ponies would suffer from this and we could rather help them first. After all, a happy pony is a loyal one. The Elder, however, would rather just make a few tweaks and leave it at that..."
 
 FSR_blueberry:0 "Blueberry Prevails"
 FSR_blueberry_desc:0 "In a snap election, it was concluded that Elder Blueberry will continue to hold her position as Elder. She promises to continue her balanced approach, keeping our Mission in mind."
 
 FSR_strawberry:0 "Strawberry Lemonade Becomes Elder"
 FSR_strawberry_desc:0 "In a snap election, it was concluded that Paladin Strawberry Lemonade will take reins of the Chapter. She promises to have an emphasis on those outside the Chapter."
 
 FSR_badpony:0 "Nova Rage Takes Over"
 FSR_badpony_desc:0 "In a snap election, it was concluded that Star-Paladin Nova Rage will assume control of the Chapter. She has expressed the controversial idea of forming an alliance with Red Eye and has called for us to exert our control over the 'inferior' Wastelanders. She decides to..."

 ###Continuation###
 
 FSR_buisnessusual:0 "Business as Usual"
 FSR_buisnessusual_desc:0 "The Status Quo has been preserved and Blueberry Sabre continues to be Elder. We can carry on with our Mission."
 
 FSR_southbases:0 "South End Bases"
 FSR_southbases_desc:0 "With the Partisans driven from South End, we can finally establish some permanent bases in the area and secure it completely"
 
 FSR_enemydoor:0 "Enemy at Our Doorstep"
 FSR_enemydoor_desc:0 "Sunnyshore has fallen and its ponies are being marched off in chains to work in Red Eye's factories. Many in our ranks fear that we will be the next target of his conquest, so we must decide what to do about it."
 
 FSR_aggressivestance:0 "Aggressive Stance"
 FSR_aggressivestance_desc:0 "Offense is the best defence!"
 
 FSR_defensivestance:0 "Defensive Stance"
 FSR_defensivestance_desc:0 "Defence is the best defence!"
 
 FSR_fightmadagascar:0 "Fight For Deepwater"
 FSR_fightmadagascar_desc:0 "The region of Deepwater shares a large border with our realm, and is only lightly defended. We might be able to take it even with limited military action."
 
 FSR_fortifymadagascar:0 "Fortify Deepwater"
 FSR_fortifymadagascar_desc:0 "Deepwater is in our hooves, and we must secure it in order to prevent Red Eye from taking it back!"
 
 FSR_househardpoint:0 "Every House a Hardpoint"
 FSR_househardpoint_desc:0 "If Red Eye wants to take over our lands, we will make his armies bleed! Traps on every street, snipers in every window, bunkers in every cellar, and patrols combing the city day and night. The streets will drown in the blood of his servants before I give up Fillydelphia!"
 
 FSR_mechaspritemines:0 "Mechasprite Mines"
 FSR_mechaspritemines_desc:0 "Originally developed by Robronco as construction robots, these parasprite-inspired constructs have the ability to replicate themselves. If we put the Stable-Tec Maneframe in charge of them and give it the directive to defend the city, they could be very useful."
 
 FSR_hqprotectrons:0 "Reprogram HQ Defences"
 FSR_hqprotectrons_desc:0 "The Stable-Tec HQ is home to hundreds of automated security systems. Even if we only manage to reprogram 10% of them, they would be a welcome addition to our defences."
 
 FSR_defensenetwork:0 "Finish Autonomous Defence Network"
 FSR_defensenetwork_desc:0 "Before the War, countless anti-air hardpoints were built in Fillydelphia, with the intention of linking them to a Crusader Maneframe that would use them to shoot down any dragon or missile that dared enter our airspace. The project was never completed, but we can bring back a diminished version of it in our half of Fillyddelphia."
 
 FSR_stable2expedition:0 "The Stable 2 Expedition"
 FSR_stable2expedition_desc:0 "Stable 2, more than a hundred miles to the west of Stable-Tec HQ, is a true treasure trove of advanced technology! We will continue our mission to secure such technology, and prepare an expedition to make the long journey to the Stable!"
 
 FSR_steelalliance:0 "The Steel Alliance"
 FSR_steelalliance_desc:0 "Too long has every Chapter of the Steel Rangers stood alone against the world! We shall ask all our Brothers and Sisters far and wide to join together in a grand alliance, so that we may stand against any foe!"
 
 FSR_newrations:0 "New Rations"
 FSR_newrations_desc:0 "In the depths of the Stable-Tec HQ, there lay countless storerooms, some filled to the top with non-perishables. The Elder has decided that now is the time to use this reserve to increase rations and allow couples to have more foals. We'll need them in the wars to come."
 
 FSR_newknights:0 "Expand the Knights"
 FSR_newknights_desc:0 "We are in a precarious situation. With Red Eye knocking on our door and the Enclave rearing it's ugly head, we will need every hoof on deck and ready to fight! Therefore, Blueberry Sabre intends to abolish retirement for Knights and get many of the old guard back into active service."
 
 FSR_steelyouth:0 "Youth Training Program"
 FSR_steelyouth_desc:0 "It is never a good sign when a military lowers the age of conscription, but we are strapped for ponypower and must therefore prepare everypony that can fire a rifle to be ready for the fight of their lives."
 
 FSR_morescribes:0 "Expand the Scribes"  
 FSR_morescribes_desc:0 "The Scribes are vital to our production and research capabilities. If we want to remain ahead of the wasteland rabble, we will need to expand their ranks!"
 
 FSR_superscribes:0 "Bunker Schools"
 FSR_superscribes_desc:0 "The kids need to go to school. The kids also need to be kept safe. The obvious solution to both of these problems is to build our schools in the form of underground bunkers!"
 
 FSR_techreclaim:0 "Reclaim Lost Technology"
 FSR_techreclaim_desc:0 "Our Mission has always been, and will always be, the reclamation and protection of all old-world technology. Today we celebrate that Mission, and how much we have achieved already."
 
 FSR_raidsilver:0 "Raid Silverwing for Tech"
 FSR_raidsilver_desc:0 "The Silverwing Army Depot is relatively close to our base of operations and only protected by some incompetent mobsters. If we attack with surprise and ferocity, we will surely be able to liberate whatever technology they are hoarding there."
 
 FSR_raidpit:0 "Raid the Pit for Blueprints"
 FSR_raidpit_desc:0 "The is one of the largest industrial centres of the Wasteland. It contains thousands of workers and metric tons of electronics, advanced technology, and weapons. It is also filled to the brim with armed slavers and even more armed Talons. If we wish to acquire some of its treasures, we will have to be sneaky..."
 
 FSR_slapredeye:0 "Put Red Eye in His Place"
 FSR_slapredeye_desc:0 "The time has come to end the Wasteland's greatest menace! No longer shall Red Eye hoard slaves and technology he doesn't even understand. We shall liberate the technology... and the slaves too, I guess."
 
 FSR_demeter:0 "Project Demeter"
 FSR_demeter_desc:0 "Few are those in the Wasteland that have never known hunger, but there are methods to solve such problems..."
 
 FSR_haephestus:0 "Project Hephaestus"
 FSR_haephestus_desc:0 "Beneath all the gunfire and screaming, if you listen very carefully, you can hear the roaring of an enormous furnace. An infernal machine that is fed day and night by the scraps of the Old World, in order to produce thousands upon thousands of guns and munitions."
 
 FSR_con_the_new_territories:0 "Administrating the New Territories"
 FSR_con_the_new_territories_desc:0 "We now find ourselves with quite a lot of land, and not enough ponies to govern it all. In order to help deal with it all, we shall be establishing civilian governments to handle large stretches of this land, while being overseen by loyal rangers. This will hopefully also calm tensions with the locals and help avert any future uprising against us."
 
 FSR_con_emancipation:0 "Emancipation"
 FSR_con_emancipation_desc:0 "We've found ourselves with a large supply of slaves, and unfortunately we have no idea what to do with them. We can't afford to feed and clothe them, we have no idea how to prevent them from rebelling, and we really have no need for them. So, as a solution to this problem, we are simply going to proclaim their freedom. They'll surely appreciate it."
 
 FSR_con_subjugation:0 "Subjugation"
 FSR_con_subjugation_desc:0 "With so many slaves, what else is there to do but to put them to work? We'll be nicer to them then Red Eye was, certainly, and they'll soon come to appreciate the benefits of living under our protection and rule."
 
 FSR_con_old_quotas:0 "Enforce the Old Quotas"
 FSR_con_old_quotas_desc:0 "Red Eye worked these slaves to the bone. Unfortunately for them, we have no intention of changing that. They'll work to produce all we need, and they'll be glad for our protection while they do it."
 
 FSR_con_expand_foundries:0 "Expand the Foundries"
 FSR_con_expand_foundries_desc:0 "Red Eye's steel production was one of the main backbones of his industry. We're going to need a lot of this steel if we're going to keep our own forces supplied, so it would be in our best interest to extend his steel mills."
 
 FSR_con_slave_rangers:0 "Allow Slaves to Become Rangers"
 FSR_con_slave_rangers_desc:0 "Our strict recruitment standards are what allowed us to maintain the most professional army in the Wasteland. However, we can no longer rely on a small elite force to protect all of our territory. To ensure that we can protect all of our new land, we must begin looking for new recruits. And what better source than the recently freed slaves, who would be fully willing to die for their liberators?"
 
 FSR_con_slave_compromise:0 "The Great Compromise"
 FSR_con_slave_compromise_desc:0 "Some of the former slaves have proven to not be as grateful as we would hope. These so-called 'Unions' are stirring trouble, with their pesky demands for self-governence and representation for the masses. Though we would never oblige such silly demands, we are forced to reach some sort of agreement with them. Paladin Strawberry Lemonade has come up with a proposal to appease them, while still keeping our own power. In exchange for limited autonomy being granted to the former slaves communities, they will be expected to serve in the defence of our nation should we ever be threatened. "
 
 FSR_con_scour_ruins:0 "Scour the Fillydelphia Ruins"
 FSR_con_scour_ruins_desc:0 "The ruins of Fillydelphia are a treasure trove of useful materials. With a bit of effort, we could seek out all of this treasure to help fuel our own industrial efforts."
 
 FSR_con_rebuild_key_infra:0 "Rebuild Key Infrastructure"
 FSR_con_rebuild_key_infra_desc:0 "Despite all of Red Eye's work towards rebuilding Fillydelphia, one aspect of the city was near entirely ignored: it's infrastructure. We will focus on that which he overlooked, and work on bringing water purification centers and power plants back online. Every ranger shall get to know the joys of clean water and airconditioning, and I can finally power that old massage chair that's been sitting in storage for ages."
 
 FSR_con_united_filly:0 "A United Fillydelphia"
 FSR_con_united_filly_desc:0 "Riots are only monthly now rather than weekly, and quite a lot of work has been done in regards to consolidating our control. With the resistence efforts quickly fading away, we can finally say with full confidence that Fillydelphia is under our control at last. Now we can begin turning our attention to our other territories, and to the threads that surround them."
 
 FSR_con_flatlands_industry:0 "Subsidize the Flatland's Industry"
 FSR_con_flatlands_industry_desc:0 "What we now call the Flatlands was, under Red Eye's rule, largely an expanse of nothingness. It was merely the land that connected Fillydelphia to the Cathedral, and as such, had no real development other than roads and rails. This has left our administration over it in a bit of a rough spot, so to help them out we will be funding the creation of factories across their land. It'll just be the start, but hopefully they can take our investments and use them to grow their economy into the future."
 
 FSR_con_flatlands_agony:0 "Build Up Agony"
 FSR_con_flatlands_agony_desc:0 "The appropriately named city of Agony is a terrible place to live. Food is scarce, jobs are scarcer, and crime is the only thing in plenty. However, it has also become the unfortunate seat of the Flatland's Administration. To help them out a bit, and to show the locals all the benefits of our benevolent rule, we will invest in creating a proper industrial district for the city."
 
 FSR_con_flatlands_army:0 "Train the Flatlands Army"
 FSR_con_flatlands_army_desc:0 "The armies of the Flatland's are largely comprised of low ranking ex-slavers, untrained local militias, and novice mercenaries. Their lack of professionalism is not just a problem for the locals, who they constantly harass, but also a problem for us now that we are in control of the region. It'll take some effort to whip them into shape, but it will be worth it at the end of the day."
 
 FSR_con_march_silverwing:0 "March on Silverwing"
 FSR_con_march_silverwing_desc:0 "Silverwing Army Depot is rightful Ministry of Wartime Technology property. While we know this, it seems that the various criminals and squatters in the area don't. It's about time we inform them with a bullet."
 
 FSR_con_contingent_silverwing:0 "Found the Silverwing Contingent"
 FSR_con_contingent_silverwing_desc:0 "With S.A.D. under our control, we may now see about handling all of our new land. We can't trust any of the locals with control over the Army Depot, and we're not certain we can trust them with self-governence either. So instead we shall establish a new contingent of the Steel Rangers, and ensure that it faithfully sees to consolidating control over its new land."
 
 FSR_con_integrate_light:0 "Integrate the Luminous City"
 FSR_con_integrate_light_desc:0 "'The Light' is home to a very large arcane fusion plant, which has allowed it to remain fully electrified over the past two centuries. This ended up being the reason for it's name, with it's lights shining like a beacon in the dark across all of the Wasteland. While the residents of the city were content to use their electricity for minor things such as proper lighting, we could instead put it to much greater use."
 
 FSR_con_sunnyshore_salvage:0 "Send Salvage Teams to Sunnyshore"
 FSR_con_sunnyshore_salvage_desc:0 "Sunnyshore has so many ruins that most scavenger's would be overjoyed to go through them. Unfortunately, the local settlements have always been too busy bickering with one another to actually bother picking through ruins. As a result, it falls to us to take up that task."
 
 FSR_con_sunnyshore_recruit:0 "Sunnyshore Recruitment Centres"

 FSR_sl_mwt4_desc:0 "Anti-Machine Rifles were one of the many inventions to come out of the MWT during the War, as a counter to Zebrican robots. Though some are concerned that they could be used against our own power armoured soldiers, we fear that not investing in this technology leave us at a disadvantage. As such, we will resume the development of these weapons immediately."
 
 FSR_sl_mwt5:0 "Rapid Fire Weapons"
 FSR_sl_mwt5_desc:0 "Though countering heavy armour is all fine and good, most of our enemies do not possess such heavy armour. If we wish to counter the raiders, the slavers, and even the alicorns, we should begin investing in fast firing low-calibre weaponry."
 
 FSR_sl_mwt6:0 "Power Armour Advancements"
 FSR_sl_mwt6_desc:0 "Our power armour has served us well for over 200 years. However, there also haven't been any real advances in power armour technology in those 200 years. We think it's about time we improve upon our old designs, so that our soldiers may be protected in the wars to come."
 
 FSR_sl_mwt7:0 "Juggernaut-Class Armour"
 FSR_sl_mwt7_desc:0 "Juggernaut-class power armour is essentially a bulked-up version of our standard armour. It possesses additional plating, along with reinforced internal components. Though it may not be the cheapest thing to assemble, it will give our soldiers unrivalled protection."
 
 FSR_sl_mwt8:0 "XVII-Class Armour"
 FSR_sl_mwt8_desc:0 "The XVII-class power armour is named as such because it can be assembled out of only 17 distinct components. This makes it far easier to mass-produce than our current power armour, which is necessary if we wish to continue to expand our power armoured infantry."
 
 FSR_sl_mom:0 "The Ministry of Morale"
 FSR_sl_mom_desc:0 "The Ministry of Morale was founded with the responsibility of keeping civilian morale high. However, as the war escalated, they began to conduct counterespionage operations across all of Equestria. The measures they took in combating zebra infiltration only grew more and more invasive, until they were keeping an eye on every Equestrian, with little regard for personal rights."
 
 FSR_sl_mom2:0 "Refurbish the Fun Farm"
 FSR_sl_mom2_desc:0 "The Fillydelphia Fun Farm was constructed as part of an initiative by the Ministry of Morale to provide fun and entertainment to the residents of Fillydelphia. We think it would make the perfect place to build a new Hub for our newly reformed Ministry."
 
 FSR_sl_mom3:0 "The Show Begins"
 FSR_sl_mom3_desc:0 "With the Hub complete, the Ministry of Morale may resume doing what it has always done: keeping spirits high."
 
 FSR_sl_mom4:0 "Smile, Smile, Smile"
 FSR_sl_mom4_desc:0 "Stay happy and keep laughing! If you don't, we'll find you. And then we'll make you laugh."
 
 FSR_sl_mom5:0 "Auntie Pinkie is Always Watching"
 FSR_sl_mom5_desc:0 "We know when you're sleeping. We know when you're awake. We know when you've been bad or good, so be good for Pinkie's sake!"
 
 FSR_sl_mom6:0 "The Gift of Laughter"
 FSR_sl_mom6_desc:0 "Though life may be happy and joyful here in Equestria, the same can't be said about those outside of our borders. This is unacceptable. We will launch a campaign to cheer up all those unhappy frowny ponies across The Wasteland!"
 
 FSR_sl_mom7:0 "Your Life for Equestria"
 FSR_sl_mom7_desc:0 "Remember: if you are not with us, you are against us! Spies, traitors, and zebra sympathisers alike all infest our lands, corrupting the minds of our people. Anyone found to be guilty of working against our Grand Regent shall be sentenced to military service, for only in death can they earn forgiveness."
 
 FSR_sl_mom8:0 "The Party That Never Ends"
 FSR_sl_mom8_desc:0 "Chems! Super duper amazing chems! They keep the ponies dancing, the party going, and our soldiers marching. The Ministry of Morale shall handle the research, manufacturing, and distribution of chems to increase the effectiveness of our armed forces."
 
 FSR_sl_mop:0 "The Ministry of Peace"
 FSR_sl_mop_desc:0 "The Ministry of Peace was entrusted with caring for the public health and welfare of Equestria's citizens, as well as providing medical services for the Equestrian military, along with advancing research and development so as to assist in carrying out those responsibilities. Though many within our ranks scoff at the idea of reestablishing what they see as the most useless Ministry, we recognize the need for their services in ensuring a stable and healthy nation."
 
 FSR_sl_mop2:0 "The Hospital Hub"
 FSR_sl_mop2_desc:0 "In line with the Ministry of Peace's mission, we shall be restoring and expanding Fillydelphia's Hearts and Hooves Hospital to serve as both the cities primary health centre and the Ministries very own Hub."
 
 FSR_sl_mop3:0 "Heal Without Discrimination"
 FSR_sl_mop3_desc:0 "We will make sure to treat all wounded, whether friend or foe... though the enemies wounded will be given to our interrogators afterwards."
 
 FSR_sl_mop4:0 "Develop New Medication"
 FSR_sl_mop4_desc:0 "Much of Equestria is still relying on medication manufactured during the War. This won't do at all! If we wish to have a healthy and happy people, we must begin by providing them with the medication that they need."
 
 FSR_sl_mop5:0 "Implement Factory Safety Standards"
 FSR_sl_mop5_desc:0 "In Red Eye's Fillydelphia, worker safety was hardly a concern. As a result, many of his old factories lack even the most basic safety features, such as guard rails.  The Ministry of Peace, in the interest of ensuring the well-being of Equestria's workers, will be launching a campaign to drastically improve the workplace safety of all factories deemed not up to code."
 
 FSR_sl_mop6:0 "The Peace Corps"
 FSR_sl_mop6_desc:0 "The Peace Corps is perhaps one of the reformed Ministry of Peace's most popular proposals, with wide support from our more militaristic officials. They would be an organization of medical professionals, dedicated to the health and well-being of our mighty Equestrian military. After all, every dead soldier is a wasted soldier."
 
 FSR_sl_mop7:0 "Subdermal Healing Implants"
 FSR_sl_mop7_desc:0 "One of the newest innovations from the Ministry of Peace is an implant designed to automatically release a dosage of healing potion when needed. We plan on rolling this implant out to much of our military, so as to greatly improve their odds of surviving each battle."
 
 FSR_sl_mop8:0 "You've Heard of Rad-Away..."
 FSR_sl_mop8_desc:0 "...but have you heard of Rad-Away 2? That's right, this brand new improvement upon the old classic formula that you all know and love is capable of purging up to twice the amount of radiation! That's right, up to twice the amount! Plus, it's patented formula has been carefully designed to ensure minimal allergic reactions, something that was a bit of a problem with the old Rad-Away. So say goodbye radiation poisoning, and say hello to a brighter future! This ad paid for and sponsored by the Ministry of Peace."
 
 FSR_sl_moi:0 "The Ministry of Image"
 FSR_sl_moi_desc:0 "The Ministry of Image is perhaps the least remembered of all of the Ministries. Their work is everywhere: every street, every town, and every city contains their work. Yet, most ponies don't realize it. The Ministry of Image very rarely advertised itself, after all. They were responsible for the design, production, and distribution of both marketing materials and propaganda, across all of Equestria."
 
 FSR_sl_moi2:0 "Rebuild the Canterlot Hub"
 FSR_sl_moi2_desc:0 "The old Ministry of Image Hub in Canterlot is perhaps the most functional and least damaged of all of the Canterlot Hubs. Due to this, it has been decided that it will serve just fine as the primary hub of the reformed Ministry. All we need to do is clear a bit of rubble, fix a few things, and remove all these skeletons."
 
 FSR_sl_moi3:0 "Propagate to the Masses"
 FSR_sl_moi3_desc:0 "Equestria may not be the unified nation it once was, but that won't stop us. We shall work around the clock to ensure that only the finest propaganda is being shown to every last Equestrian."
 
 FSR_sl_moi4:0 "Control the Press"
 FSR_sl_moi4_desc:0 "Some less reputable sources seek to stir up trouble by making a big deal of every minor thing. Officials having affairs or accepting bribes is hardly newsworthy. And war crimes happen every single day! There's no reason why the good folks of Equestria need to be troubled with such nonsense. So, we shall strictly monitor and control all information being presented to the public, to ensure that it is worth their time of day."
 
 FSR_sl_moi5:0 "Exalt the Leadership"
 FSR_sl_moi5_desc:0 "Truly, Grand Regent Strawberry Lemonade and Her ponies could do nothing wrong. And soon, everyone in Equestria will believe it."
 
 FSR_sl_moi6:0 "The Best Nation in the World"
 FSR_sl_moi6_desc:0 "Our citizens should feel blessed to live in such a great nation. No other nation is as prosperous and happy as our own! Anyone who says otherwise is clearly spreading sedition."
 
 FSR_sl_moi7:0 "Radicalize the Populus"
 FSR_sl_moi7_desc:0 "The enemy is weak, for they are unenlightened and savage. The enemy is strong, for they are many and unflinching. We must all be willing to make sacrifices, for the greater good of all of Equestria."
 
 FSR_sl_moi8:0 "Wars of \"Liberation\""
 FSR_sl_moi8_desc:0 "Our wars are justified, for they are not intended to kill and conquer, but to free and enligten. How could anyone oppose such a noble goal?"
 
 FSR_sl_mas:0 "The Ministry of Arcane Sciences"
 FSR_sl_mas_desc:0 "The Ministry of Arcane Sciences was dedicated to magical research and development. They were crucial to the Equestrian war effort and worked closely with the other Ministries to help create many of the iconic innovations of wartime Equestria. Their innovations were what allowed Equestria to keep up with Zebrica's own advancements."
 
 FSR_sl_mas2:0 "Reclaim Old Facilities"
 FSR_sl_mas2_desc:0 "The Ministry of Arcane Sciences had many installations all over Equestria. A series of expeditions will be launched to reclaim some of these facilities, and one of them shall be selected to serve as the Ministries new primary Hub."
 
 FSR_sl_mas3:0 "Dust Off the Tomes"
 FSR_sl_mas3_desc:0 "Now that the Ministry of Arcane Science is back up and running, it can once again pursue its noble goal of advancing Equestrian knowledge and science."
 
 FSR_sl_mas4:0 "The Pony Races"
 FSR_sl_mas4_desc:0 "Each of the three pony races have their own magical abilities that make them unique. The Earth Ponies are endurant, strong, and very good with plants. Pegasi can fly and manipulate both the clouds and the weather. Unicorns are capable of directly channelling and utilizing magic, to do their bidding. These natural abilities should be studied, so that we may unlock our full potential."
 
 FSR_sl_mas5:0 "The Other Races"
 FSR_sl_mas5_desc:0 "Though we firmly believe that ponies are the most magical of all of the races, it would be foalish to claim that we alone have magic. As far as we can tell, magic is a constant throughout the planet, and a great deal of creatures are magical to some degree. By studying them, perhaps we can learn how to replicate their natural magic using our own."
 
 FSR_sl_mas6:0 "Magical Fuel Alternatives"
 FSR_sl_mas6_desc:0 "Crystals are great and all, but they are expensive to mine and limited in functionality. As a viable alternative to them, we have developed a new magical fuel that is substantially more efficient at powering things when compared to older methods."
 
 FSR_sl_mas7:0 "The Alicorn Project"
 FSR_sl_mas7_desc:0 "[REDACTED]"
 
 FSR_sl_mas8:0 "The Gardens of Equestria"
 FSR_sl_mas8_desc:0 "[REDACTED]"
 
 FSR_sl_moa:0 "The Traitor Ministry"
 FSR_sl_moa_desc:0 "The Ministry of Awesome was the most secretive of all of the Ministries. They were responsible for special operations, military intelligence, and the Equestrian Air Force. However, when the megaspells rained down from the sky, the pegasi and their Ministry turned their backs on their country. So though it may be resurrected, the Ministry of Awesome shall be closely watched for any signs of betrayal."
 
 FSR_sl_moa2:0 "A Hub in the Mountains"
 FSR_sl_moa2_desc:0 "The Ministry of Awesome shall be gifted a brand new Hub, built from scratch in the Cantermountains. However, this facility will be extensively wire-tapped, so that our trusted ponies can keep a close eye on the good Ministry."
 
 FSR_sl_moa3:0 "Fly High!"
 FSR_sl_moa3_desc:0 "The Ministry of Awesome shall once again be placed in charge of Equestria's Air Force. We hope to soon see it rival even the Enclave's in power."
 
 FSR_sl_moa4:0 "Flight From Experts"
 FSR_sl_moa4_desc:0 "Who would know how to fly better than creatures born with wings?"
 
 FSR_sl_moa5:0 "Advanced Aerodynamics"
 FSR_sl_moa5_desc:0 "A Pegasus is good, a nuclear jetplane is better!"
 
 FSR_sl_moa6:0 "Skybreaker Tactics"
 FSR_sl_moa6_desc:0 "Our Airforce is expected to fight Dragons and Thunderheads, they need to work out some appropriate tactics for such colossal enemies."
 
 FSR_sl_moa7:0 "The Raptor's Prey"
 FSR_sl_moa7_desc:0 "Raptor-class airships were nicknamed "Dragon Killers", due to that being their intended purpose. With heavy weapons capable of punching through a dragon's thick scales, these airships were some of the finest to serve in the Equestrian Air Force. We believe they could serve us just as well."
 
 FSR_sl_moa8:0 "Cloud Construction"
 FSR_sl_moa8_desc:0 "By incorporating clouds into our aircraft designs, we could both significantly reduce the cost of production and make them more aerodynamic."
 
 
 ###Airforce##
 
 FSR_srairforce:0 "The Steel Ranger Airforce"

 FSR_first_base_desc:0 "If we wish to begin to create an air force, we must first have a place for our aircraft to take off from and land on."
 
 FSR_airsuperiority:0 "Rival the Enclave"
 FSR_airsuperiority_desc:0 "The traitor Ministry, or \"Enclave\" as they call themselves, fled with most of Equestria's Airforce on the day the bombs dropped. If we wish to stand any chance against their airpower, we will have to focus all our efforts on securing aerial supremacy."
 
 FSR_groundsupport:0 "Support Our Groundtroops"
 FSR_groundsupport_desc:0 "What use is airpower if it doesn't help our ground troops? They are the ones taking territory and winning wars after all."
 
 FSR_base_con:0 "Concentrated Strikes"
 FSR_base_con_desc:0 "We will construct massive airbases within Fillydelphia, and turn the city into an unsinkable aircraft carrier."

 FSR_dir_doctrine_desc:0 "We will rule the skies, without a doubt!"
 
 FSR_anti_cloud:0 "Behemoths in the Sky"

 FSR_asset_def:0 "Protect Ground Assets"
 FSR_asset_def_desc:0 "It is more important to protect our existing infrastructure and civilians than it is to try to win every engagement."
 
 FSR_range_bases:0 "Spread Out Bases"
 FSR_range_bases_desc:0 "We will need bases all across the Wasteland if we want to effectively support our troops."
 
 FSR_sup_doctrine:0 "Ground Support Doctrine"
 FSR_sup_doctrine_desc:0 "Our airforce and our army need to work in unison to maximize effectiveness in battle."

In the end though, the Rangers chose..."

Eventually they settled on... "

This led to an investigation, which uncovered widespread corruption within our ranks. In response, the Elder launched a campaign..."

Nova has come to the difficult decision to offer an alliance to Red Eye. In exchange, Red Eye would hoof over any advanced tech they come across. Not like those ignorant slavers understand how technology works anyways. Besides, their ranks will get monumental support from our power armored units, and the tech that they give us will keep what's left of our Scribes busy. It's a reasonable offer, and Nova is confident that Red Eye is smart enough to at least consider it. "

 fillysr_cr.2.d:0 "Red Eye simply stares at what could be the most peculiar letter he has ever received; Nova Rage, the new Elder of the Fillydelphia Chapter of Steel Rangers, has sent a letter offering an alliance with Red Eye's army as some sort of act of eliminating tensions between the two factions. The offer was straightforward: Their soldiers would aid one another, and in exchange any advanced technology that Red Eye's nation came across would be hoofed over to the Rangers. While the support of the power armored rangers would be welcome, being forced to hoof over technology could severely hinder his nation's capabilities. With that in mind, Red Eye writes his response... "

This does sound like a much more reasonable offer; After all, there's plenty of slaves to go around. However, slavery is the thing that's single-hoofidly allowing Red Eye's efforts to move forward, and hoofed over any number of them could slow down progress towards his own goals. Then again, he doubted that they would be willing to make a better offer than this. Red Eye considers the situation carefully, before deciding to..."

Rustwreck was hoofed over to his new Ranger allies and the rest went to himself, giving him easy access to the open ocean, even if they may never sail those waters anytime soon. Today however, Red Eye was prompted with a simple request from Elder Nova: she demands the coastal territories between her slice of Fillydelphia and Rustwreck. The spoils of those lands weren't exactly proving fruitful for Red Eye, but that coastal clay could come in handy in the future. After some consideration, he decides to... "

Suspicious, we confiscated and analyzed their so-called 'serum'. We found that it was primarily a mixture of radsnake oil, pickle juice, and wonderglue!

Various medical experiments were performed on Nova and it was determined that it was a unknown neurological disease. Simply put, Nova's brain was being ravaged by this illness, and if not remedied soon enough, Nova could suffer permanent brain damage or death. The team tasked with finding a cure picked up the pace greatly and searched high and low for prewar medical records to see what could be done. However, time is running out, and some are considering approaching Red Eye after all... "

Of course, a few threats and a couple of dead Scribes was more than enough to convince the rest to get to work. Within a week, they had managed to create their cure. Nova Rage has awakened and is rapidly making a full recovery. Curiously enough, the files relating to the cure have all gone missing, and several of the Scribes have put in requests for time off.\n\nEntirely coincidentally, several unicorn slaves have also gone missing during that same time."

This has inspired Nova with engaging in a similar arrangement with Red Eye. After all, a union between their two factions could create one of the most powerful and fearsome forces the Wasteland had ever known... \n \n As an added benefit, she couldn't deny that Red Eye was a rather handsome stallion. His accomplishments were admirable, and his voice sounded like honey to any mares ears. Indeed, perhaps their relationship could evolve into romance after all.

After all, who could love one such as him, a pony that had committed such atrocities so as to become known for them across the entire Wasteland?\n\nAnd yet, here it was: a proposal for marriage by Elder Nova Rage. This proposal would fully unite their factions, but with the catch that Nova would be the one in charge. Such a thing could make Red Eye's goals and vision rather difficult to achieve, especially if she did not share them... and yet, he felt tempted none the less. Every day grew more tiresome, and the temptation to abandon his dreams grew only stronger as time went on.\n\nRed Eye stared down at the letter carrying her proposal and carefully considered his options... "
 fillysr_cr.23.a:0 "Maybe it is time to settle down."
 fillysr_cr.23.b:0 "I must not lose sight of my goal."
 
 
 
###Continuation-Events###

 fillysr_bs.1.title:0 "The Issue of Red Eye"
 fillysr_bs.1.desc:0 "With the Fall of Sunnyshore, an uncomfortable question has arisen: What would we do if Red Eye attacked us? We currently don't have the strength to fight his forces in an all-out war, but we could use our superior technology to perform surgical strikes and take over key locations while Sunnyshore is in chaos. Alternatively, we could shore up our defences and prepare to weather the storm to come. Blueberry Sabre decides to..."
 fillysr_bs.1.a:0 "Prepare for a preemptive strike."
 fillysr_bs.1.b:0 "Bide our time, for now."

 fillysr_bs.2.title:0 "The Stable 2 Expedition"
 fillysr_bs.2.desc:0 "It turns out that the data we found in the Maneframe was right! Stable 2 was located right under Sweet Apple Acres, and appears to be fully intact! Unfortunately, the downside of it being intact is that it is also still inhabited. We must carefully consider how to approach this situation. The residents of Stable 2 would perhaps be more than willing to engage in peaceful cooperation, and perhaps even integration. However, they are also fairly defenceless...we could just wipe them out and take all of the Stable's technology for ourselves."
 fillysr_bs.2.a:0 "Attempt negotiations."
 fillysr_bs.2.b:0 "They stand in the way of our Mission. Wipe them out."
 
 fillysr_bs.3.title:0 "Reclamation Day"
 fillysr_bs.3.desc:0 "For over 200 years, our Mission as Steel Rangers has remained unchanged; that the technology of the old world must be under our possession and kept from falling into the hooves of those who would abuse it. Despite the many incursions from within and without, we have been successful in discovering all the secrets and wonders of the Stable-Tec HQ and southern Fillydelphia. This successful restoration of technology has left us in a far greater position than ever before. Our Elder Blueberry is confident that with this technology, we can not only continue to fulfill our Mission, but we can also hold off our enemies. She has decreed that day will go down in history as “Reclamation Day”, to honor the monumental efforts that our brave Rangers go through to accomplish the one Mission that has been the driving force of all Steel Rangers since our founding."
 fillysr_bs.3.a:0 "Our Mission shall be fulfilled!"
 
 fillysr_bs.4.title:0 "The Silverwing Expedition"
 fillysr_bs.4.desc:0 "Northeast of us lies the Silverwing Army Depot, a prewar army base that's currently within the clutches of some raiders known as The Ringers. This base in particular interests us because we believe it to house not just an impressively stocked armory, but also a sizable number of robots and a wartime domestic surveillance system. Elder Blueberry has organized an expedition to infiltrate the base and retrieve any of the technology we can find. However, there's a problem with this expedition: The Ringers presence is going to make it difficult to get more than a small team in. As a result, we are only confident in being able to secure one of the treasures held within the facility. What should our expedition team focus on?"
 fillysr_bs.4.a:0 "The weapons. We need them more than anything."
 fillysr_bs.4.b:0 "The robots. They could come in handy."
 fillysr_bs.4.c:0 "All the data we can gather."
 
 fillysr_bs.5.title:0 "Expedition to The Pit"
 fillysr_bs.5.desc:0 "Northern Fillydelphia, or more infamously known as "The Pit", is the defacto industrial hub our greatest rival and home of the wasteland's largest slave population. Within this hub of industrial misery lies a server room, located within the former city hall, containing a great deal of files, so much so that he was instructed to bring along two data crystals, that the we have deemed of vital importance to our efforts in various forms of industry and technology. Paladin Gate Keeper and his team have been ordered by Elder Blueberry herself to conduct a covert expedition into The Pit in order to extract the files and return without getting the attention of the slavers. \n \n However, upon approaching the city hall, the team was met with a great dilemma; next to the city hall itself was a convoy of trucks packed to the brim with all sorts of fancy looking technology. It all appeared to be being unloaded by a large group of slaves. No slaver was in sight, and if the gunshots in the distance were anything to go by, they would be preoccupied for a while. The slaves themselves were a sorry lot, and Gate Keeper could tell at but a glance that they were all malnourished and abused. He found himself at an impasse. Though he could stick to his orders and try to secure as much data as possible, he could instead focus on securing as much of the physical technology as possible. Looking at the slaves before him, he also considered abandoning his original mission and focusing on getting these poor souls out of here. Time was of the essence and a decision would have to be reached soon."
 fillysr_bs.5.a:0 "His morality wins out. Abandon the mission and free the slaves."
 fillysr_bs.5.b:0 "Change the mission and secure the technology."
 fillysr_bs.5.c:0 "Continue the mission and secure the data."

 fillysr_bs.6.title:0 "Victory in Deepwater"
 fillysr_bs.6.desc:0 "The skirmishes over Deepwater have proven fruitful for us. The slavers stationed there couldn't stand the sheer strength that power armor can provide, and have have retreated. The now free ponies that used to be slaves within this territory have welcomed us."
 fillysr_bs.6.a:0 "Our banners fly over Deepwater."
 
 fillysr_bs.7.title:0 "Stalemate in Deepwater"
 fillysr_bs.7.desc:0 "The skirmishes over Deepwater have resulted in a stalemate. Despite the efforts of our best rangers, the slavers have proven themselves deeply entrenched within the territory. The fighting has slowed to a standstill, with neither side able to advance against the other. For now, we'll hold our position and wait for another opportunity to strike."
 fillysr_bs.7.a:0 "Deepwater will be ours. Eventually."
 
 fillysr_bs.8.title:0 "Defeat in Deepwater"
 fillysr_bs.8.desc:0 "The skirmishes over Deepwater have resulted in failure. The slavers were far more prepared than we expected, and our attacking rangers were repelled with heavy casualties. The lives of many mares and stallions have been lost, and with nothing to show for it."
 fillysr_bs.8.a:0 "We should rethink our strategy."
 
 fillysr_bs.90.t:0 "Establishing Civilian Administrations"
 fillysr_bs.90.d:0 "The vast amount of territory we've found ourselves with is unfortunately a bit of a problem for us. We don't have anywhere near enough ponies to occupy all of this land, and the locals have grown increasingly unfriendly towards our patrols. To help prevent this situation from escalating into an ugly crisis, we shall establish civilian administrations to oversee these lands.\n\nOne of these administrations is fairly obvious. The Sunnyshore Coalition shall be restablished, with all of their lands returned. They will of course have some Steel Ranger oversight, but their settlements shall largely be allowed to handle their own affairs. We don't expect to have any problems with them from then on.\n\nThe other administration will be a bit different, along with being the larger one of the two. Red Eye was in control of quite a lot of sparsely populated land, which we have taken to referring to as the Flatlands. They shall all be organized under one central administration, led by a mix of appointed paladins and elected civilian officials. Hopefully this will allow them to both help develop the lands under them and to appeal to the locals."
 fillysr_bs.90.a:0 "They'll do a fine job."
 
 fillysr_bs.91.t:0 "Everfree Blues"
 fillysr_bs.91.d:0 "Ever since our victory, one particular stretch of land has proven troublesome for us. The Everfree Forest, one of the most wild and dangerous places in Equestria, has rapidly become the refuge for all sorts of nasty sorts. Slavers, fanatics, and resistence fighters have all taken to making the forest their home. Our power armor hardly lends well to that sort of environment, and the constant ambushes and skirmishes have led to an assignment within the forest being equated to a suicide mission. Despite this, we were confident that we could establish our firm control over the region. Unfortunately, our confidence appears to have been hubris.\n\nRed Eye's most loyal fanatics, his so-called 'Children of the Cathedral', have brought together all of the forces that oppose us. From the remants of Stern's Talons to the most brutal and sadistic slavers, they have all joined together in resisting our rule. Our local occupation forces were quick to fall under their unexpected relentless assault, and a decent deal of rangers are still MIA, assumed to have perished within the Everfree. This has left us with no choice but to pull out of the region entirely and to leave it to its fate.\nLuckily for us, these Cultists aren't self sufficient, so we should be able to get a deal out of them, in exchange for granting them limited self Governance.\nLet them keep their dead god, so long as they pay their tithe."
 fillysr_bs.91.a:0 "Better than a war in the Everfree..."
 
 fillysr_sl.1301.title:0 "Today we celebrate..."
 fillysr_sl.1301.desc:0 "We've done it. Red Eye's empire has fallen before us, and all of his vast lands and resources now belong to us. Our rangers are rejoicing, and celebrations are being held all across Fillydelphia. Within Sunnyshore, even the locals are joining it, holding grand festivals and parades. Those who are still loyal to Red Eye's cause have ran for the hills, and everything is looking up for us.\n\nHowever, with our victory comes quite a lot of work. We'll have to deal with all of our new land, and we've yet to decide how to handle all of the many slaves that are now under our rule. Tomorrow, Elder Sabre's liquor cabinet will be touched for the first time in years. But for today, she oversees the celebrations going on within Stable-Tec Headquarters."
 fillysr_sl.1301.a:0 "...but tomorrow we work."


###Applejack###

 fillysr_sl.1.title:0 "The Wasteland Militia"
 fillysr_sl.1.desc:0 "For over 200 years, our Chapter has only recruited from within our own ranks, with exceptions being rare and far between, but no longer! Today marks the beginning of a new era for the Steel Ranger's armed forces: From now on every able-bodied earth-pony or unicorn may join our ranks if they so wish, and be part of our glorious Mission. Ad Victoriam!"
 fillysr_sl.1.a:0 "Allowing anypony into our ranks? What's next, recruiting raiders?"

 fillysr_sl.2.title:0 "The New Direction"
 fillysr_sl.2.desc:0 "With the election of Elder Strawberry Lemonade, our Chapter has set down a new path. Rather than adhere to some outdated 'Mission' that has accomplished very little, we shall instead focus on rebuilding this great nation. Equestria would be saved, and her ponies along with it. Of course, there is still much work to be done before that dream can be accomplished. "
 fillysr_sl.2.a:0 "To a bright future!"

 fillysr_sl.3.title:0 "Stand Against Red Eye"
 fillysr_sl.3.desc:0 "The communication-crystal glowed dimly as Strawberry prepared to record her speech. It was an interesting piece of technology, one that had just been gathering dust for over 200 years now. Now, it would once again be used as it was intended: to share ones voice across all of Equestria! Or in this case, all of Fillydelphia. She took a deep breath and began:\n\n'My fellow ponies, I am Elder Strawberry Lemonade of the Fillydelphia Contingent of the Steel Rangers. For many years, you may have known us as a force to be feared and avoided, but that has changed! Our intentions are purely to rid the Wasteland of one of its greatest evils: Red Eye. Like a cancerous tumor, this vile monster has spread his influence across the wasteland. Every day, his slavers kidnap more ponies, forcing them to work until they kneel over. No more! All those who are pure of heart, all those who wish for freedom, and all those who dream of a better world, I emplore you: join us, help us, and together we can bring him down!'"
 fillysr_sl.3.a:0 "The madponies reign shall not last!"
 
 fillysr_sl.4.title:0 "The Sunnyshore Council"
 fillysr_sl.4.desc:0 "'We can't go to war right now!' Strawberry said for the umpfteenth time. 'Look, I recognize how bad this must feel, having to flee from your homes or be enslaved by Red Eye, but our Chapter just isn't ready for an all-out conflict yet.' Opposite her sat the 4 remaining councilponies that had formerly led the Sunnyshore Coalition. The delegate from Hoofburg shook his head. 'Yes, it seems desperate, but you're our only hope! If not now then when?', to which Strawberry replied, 'In two years, maybe even one if you help us.' That seemed to lift their spirits. The only surviving delеgate of Sunnyshore proper was next to respond: 'Then we shall wait, even though a year might seem an eternity while in exile. However, we could still keep the fight going! The ponies of Sunnyshore are not cowed easily, and if you provide the caps to keep them going, they will fight on. I might also add that I, and every true Sunnyshore citizen, would be greatly appreciative of your aid. I'm sure my colleagues agree.' The other delegates nodded, though hesitantly."
 fillysr_sl.4.a:0 "We can't afford to fund you, but we will offer you sanctuary."
 fillysr_sl.4.b:0 "Some assistance may be offered, though not much."
 fillysr_sl.4.c:0 "You have our full support!"
 
 fillysr_sl.5.title:0 "A Meeting With Partisans"
 fillysr_sl.5.desc:0 "The leader of the so-called 'Partisans' is an earth pony by the name of Winchester. He rose to power with a great deal of fiery rhetoric, along with his impressive organizational talents. Indeed, we believe him to be the one primarily responsible for their unique style of fighting. Strawberry, in the interest of ending this pointless conflict once and for all, has called for negotiations between their two factions. Now, Winchester himself has arrived to discuss finally ending their conflict for good. accepted the meeting, and what followed was a meeting that had already been going on for hours and left Strawberry with a rather terrible headache.\n\n'Absolutely not! We will not allow some tin cans to trot on us as if we were dirt!'\n\nNegotiations were hardly going well. Winchester was proving himself one of the most hard-headed and stubborn ponies she had ever met, and that's even when taking Nova Rage into account. If this continued, the meeting would devolve into death threats for the third time today. So, deciding enough was enough, Strawberry spoke:\n\n'Please, calm down. Nopony wants to trot on anypony else. Surely, you must recognize that if we are not allowed free travel through Fillydelphia, it would make defending against Red Eye all the harder. And we both know that his slavers very much would trot on your people, followed by enslaving them.'\n\nWinchester conceded the point. Strawberry smiled: earlier, he wouldn't of budged in the slightest. Ground was being made."
 fillysr_sl.5.a:0 "Cooler heads could prevail."
 
 fillysr_sl.6.title:0 "Partisan Knights?"
 fillysr_sl.6.desc:0 "Strawberry couldn't help but smile when she saw one of the former Partisans and one of her own Knights joking around in the mess hall. Not a year ago, they would have tried to kill eachother on sight. Now they were working together. It seemed the old saying her mother loved so much was true: Friendship really is Magic. She shook her head. Magic and good thoughts alone wouldn't win the war against Red Eye. They needed weapons, bodies and expertise. Fortunately for them, the Partisans could provide two of the three in good numbers. By allowing them to join the ranks of the Knights, her armies would be increased in size substantially. However, the more conservative members of the Chapter would likely raise Tartarus if she allowed such a thing..."
 fillysr_sl.6.a:0 "We can't risk upsetting our more experienced rangers."
 fillysr_sl.6.b:0 "Who cares what those old mules think?"
 
 fillysr_sl.7.title:0 "Wastelander Citizenship?"
 fillysr_sl.7.desc:0 "Citizenship had never been an issue that the Rangers had to deal with: You were either born into the Chapter, or, in rare cases, allowed to join because of exceptionally useful talent. But the term 'Chapter' seemed to get more and more loose by the day, as outsiders came in and intermingled. While they were still technically a military organization, loyal to Equestria, there hadn't been much of a government left to give them orders. In fact, Strawberry was pretty sure that she could claim to be the highest ranking member of the Equestrian government left. Maybe she actually had the authority to give out citizenship... but who would qualify? Only the best and brightest, the most desirable for rebuilding Equestria? Or should she declare all ponies to be citizens of Equestria, so long as they follow her laws?"
 fillysr_sl.7.a:0 "Citizenship is a privilege, not a right."
 fillysr_sl.7.b:0 "We are all Equestrians here."
 
 fillysr_sl.8.title:0 "Campaign Begins to Show Effects"
 fillysr_sl.8.desc:0 "While progress has been rather slow so far, the first good news about the anti-discrimination campaign reached Strawberry today: Voluntary sign-ups for integration-courses increased by almost 20% during the last month. The main reason for this appears to be the inspiring speeches of a certain Scribe by the name of 'Fiery Fervor', whose words have reached a great many ears. He is said to appeal largely to both idealism and practicality, promising a brighter future while also pointing out the benefits of unity within our Chapter. Impressed by his effectiveness, the Elder has extended an offer to become a teacher for the courses to him."
 fillysr_sl.8.a:0 "Great!"
 
 fillysr_sl.9.title:0 "Campaign Proves Effective in Schools"
 fillysr_sl.9.desc:0 "It appears the initial success was not a fluke after all, as the anti-discrimination campaign has recently managed to reduce the amount of discrimination-related incidents at our schools by almost half. Bullying seems to be down and friendships between outside-born students and Chapter-born students seem to be blossoming more and more. Our teaching staff has proven to be exellent at instilling the right ideas in these young minds, not the least because of the instructions they have received from the new vice-head of our Education Commitee, Fiery Fervor. Some voices have even suggested offering him a higher position after the campaign has done its job. After all, he has more than proven himself."
 fillysr_sl.9.a:0 "The students of today will be the rulers of tomorrow."
 
 fillysr_sl.10.title:0 "Campaign Declared a Success"
 fillysr_sl.10.desc:0 "It was a day of little fanfare, but nevertheless one of great triumph! By direct decree, [ROOT.GetLeader] has declared the anti-discrimination campaign to have been a resounding success. While discrimination is by no means gone, it is no longer a national issue, and will be dealt with on a more local level. But still: Reports of the first marriages between former Wastelanders and Rangers have given hope to Strawberry. Hope that they could move forward and leave their old hatred behind. The next generation would grow up in an environment where all were equal, regardless of their parents being from a Chapter or the Wasteland!"
 fillysr_sl.10.a:0 "We are all ponies."
 
 fillysr_sl.11.title:0 "The Nova Rage Affair"
 fillysr_sl.11.desc:0 "Though Elder Strawberry had been elected to her position fair and square, many within her Chapter still resented her and opposed her at every turn. From merely loudly badmouthing her rule, to outright refusing to follow orders, many ponies had rapidly become thorns in her side. The worst of these offenders, by far, was Star Paladin Nova Rage. The Star Paladin was a powerful member of the Chapter, and she knew it. She not only made sure to 'mishear' or 'misinterpret' almost every order the Elder gave, but she also covered for other ponies who did the same. If Strawberry was to secure her reign, she would have no choice but to deal with Nova in one way or another.\n\nTalking to her clearly had no effect, thanks largely to the power she held. She was too confident that she couldn't be touched, and perhaps she was right. That is, if we were playing fair.\n\nOne of Strawberry's most avid supporters, Scribe Notebook Scribble, had devised a plan to be rid of Nova once and for all. Recently, one of the oldest and most conservative Paladins within our Chapter passed away. Old Paladin Fishstick was often accused of being a bit senile in his old age, but he was still well respected. Perhaps more importantly, he was a well known critic of Nova Rage, with the two getting into arguments anytime they were in the same room together. It wouldn't be a stretch to claim that one of these arguments had escalated to the point of Nova Rage doing something brash.\n\nAll that had to be decided was Nova Rages punishment. Exile would be the standard punishment for such a crime, but it would risk some of her most fanatical followerers leaving along with her and going who knows where. Killing her would deal with the problem for good, though it would leave us dealing with her very angry followers." 
 fillysr_sl.11.a:0 "Deal with her for good."
 fillysr_sl.11.b:0 "Procedure calls for exile."
 
 fillysr_sl.12.title:0 "Vanilla Swirl's Offer"
 fillysr_sl.12.desc:0 "Following the dishonorable discharge and punishment of Nova Rage, her successor was quick to secure power. Star Paladin Vanilla Swirl was always an ambitious mare, and was more than competent enough to pursue those ambitions. This brings us to the current issue: She was willing to reign in the Paladins and help us unite the Chapter. However, in exchange, she demanded that she be given a say in all going-ons of the Chapter. Her motives were questionable at best, and we could likely get by just fine without her. However, her support would be nice..."
 fillysr_sl.12.a:0 "Very well. It's a deal."
 fillysr_sl.12.b:0 "We don't need her help."
 
 fillysr_sl.13.title:0 "Victory Over Red Eye"
 fillysr_sl.13.desc:0 "Today marks what may be one of the most joyous moments in the Fillydelphia Chapter's history. Their sworn enemy is presumed dead and his empire is no more. This tremendous victory is one that will go down in the history books, and already plans are being made to declare a holiday to celebrate this feat. Not only is Red Eye himself believed to be dead, but his top lieutenant, Stern, has been confirmed to have perished in the fighting. Soon, his tyrannical rule would become nothing but a distant memory.\n\nIt wasn't just the rangers celebrating. From the Fillydelphia Pit to the Sunnyshore coastline, ponies filled the ruined city blocks, celebrating the fall of Red Eye. Former slaves and freedom fighters alike rejoiced, with even our rangers joining the celebrations in many areas. But while the mood may be celebratory now, a question would be asked in the days to come..."
 fillysr_sl.13.a:0 "What now?"

###Reclamation###
 fillysr_sl.14.title:0 "Unrest in the Streets"
 fillysr_sl.14.desc:0 "The sun was starting to set as Strawberry read through the third report about riots had she received today: This time it seemed some naive portion of the slaves proclaimed a 'Free State of Fillydelphia' within a factory complex in the Pit. While they were dispersed quickly enough, the sheer amount of similar reports was worrying. Many of the former slaves did not seem content with being freed from the yoke of Red Eye and were demanding an independent representative government. A ridiculous proposal of course, as Equestria had been a diarchy for time immemorial. Elder Strawberry would not let some uneducated workers destroy more than a thousand years of tradition, even if she could sympathise with their desires. The next report she opened warned of a more direct problem: The unsustainability of their food supply.\n\nThe Scribes were predicting that our current stores would run out within 3-5 months, unless a solution was found. Strawberry quickly penned a letter ordering a committee to be formed to find possible solutions to their food-problem. As she put her stamp on it, a messenger carrying at least a dozen other reports stumbled into her office. It seemed she wouldn't sleep at all tonight."
 fillysr_sl.14.a:0 "A leader never rests."
 
 fillysr_sl.15.title:0 "Wave of Inflation"
 fillysr_sl.15.desc:0 "Strawberry Lemonade was left speechless after reading the report before her. Everypony knew that Red Eye was rich, and most had simply assumed it had to do with his strong industrial base and by being at the center of the slave trade. However, it appeared that this was not the case. Indeed, very few caps entered Fillydelphia; it seems they only flooded out. An investigation discovered a number of bottlecap presses that had been restored to working order. It seems Red Eye was using them to fund many of his operations. A cunning plan, indeed.\n\nIt also has served as him slapping Strawberry in the face from beyond the grave. Though we have managed to secure most of the bottlecap presses by now, we weren't able to do so before opportunists made off with their newfound fortunes. This has resulted in widespread inflation, as hundreds of thousands of shiny new bottlecaps have flooded the market. The economy was already in shambles as is, and this has been enough to push it over the tipping point. Unfortunately, it could be some time before we were in a position to properly tackle the issue..."
 fillysr_sl.15.a:0 "Another problem to solve."
 
 fillysr_sl.16.t:0 "Fighting in the Hinterlands"
 fillysr_sl.16.d:0 "'While we have secured northern Fillydelphia and Sunnyshore, the vast stretches of land further from the coast still hold remnants of Red Eyes army. They have lost their cohesion as a fighting force, but they still continue to raid both civilian caravans and our own patrols.' With a sigh, Elder Strawberry closed the folder containing the report. A small mountain of similar reports was piled upon her desk, awaiting her review. Scribe Notebook, who had been conscripted to serve as a personal assistant for today, was glancing through his own even larger mountain of reports. Any report he deemed worth the Elder's time, he added to the appropriate pile. As Strawberry took a sip of her sadly room-temperature Sparkle-Cola, Notebook floated another message to her. This one was decorated with a large orange stamp, marking it as a message of military importance.\n\nResisting the ever growing desire to curl up into a ball and cry, Strawberry opened the message. It revealed itself to be surprisingly short: 'Lost contact with expeditionary team sent to Stable 101. Patrols all throughout the Everfree have come under attack. Pulling our out of the forest and awaiting further orders.' She stared at the page for a moment before speaking: 'Notebook, get Star Paladin Vanilla Swirl in here.'"
 fillysr_sl.16.a:0 "She can deal with this!"
 
 fillysr_sl.17.t:0 "Operation Cinders"
 fillysr_sl.17.d:0 "Early this morning, Strawberry had received confirmation that Star Paladin Vanilla Swirl had completed all preparations for 'Operation Cinders' and was only waiting on her go ahead. The Elder walked over to the map-table, where Winchester was intently studying the few enemy positions they had managed to locate within the Everfree. He looked up as she came near, before speaking: 'They got themselves some mighty fine terrain there, I'll say! The Everfree would probably kill more of our colts than their bullets would. Course, that wouldn't be for lack of tryin on their part.' Strawberry nodded to that. The so-called 'Children of the Cathedral' that now infested the Everfree had turned Red Eye into a martyr, and were completely dedicated to avenging him at any cost. A moment later, Winchester continued speaking: 'If we had this forest back when we were fighting against you lot, y'all wouldn't have held Filly for a year.'\n\nStrawberry smiled at that, though it made her think. She wouldn't make the same mistake Blueberry Sabre had made, fighting endlessly against a guerilla force. And so she wouldn't. Vanilla had been ordered to prepare over 140 tons of flamer fuel, in order to burn down as much of the Everfree as possible. Ironically enough, most of had come from Red Eye's own stores. Soon enough, his followers would perish in flames. All Strawberry had to do was give the order."
 fillysr_sl.17.a:0 "'Initiate Operation Cinders. Burn them all, and let the Goddesses sort them out!'"
 
 fillysr_sl.18.t:0 "A Charred Monument"
 fillysr_sl.18.d:0 "'Fascinating. The fires are still burning!', Scribe Notebook remarked as they walked. Behind them was a procession of mainly Scribes, with a few Paladins ensuring their safety. Not that they expected anything to have survived in here. Ash swirled around their hooves with every step they took, as they made their way deeper and deeper into the burnt remains of the accursed forest. A few hundred meters away, a twisted blackened structure took up most of the view northwards. \n \n The Cathedral, once Red Eye's home and capital, had certainly seen better days. Star Paladin Vanilla Swirl had certainly done an excellent job, with  only charred corpses having been recovered from within the Cathedral itself. While its walls were bullet-ridden, and some of its towers had collapsed, the Cathedral was still an impressive structure. Indeed, it was more than large enough to become a center of commerce for us. However, it was also a monument of sorts to its creator. By allowing it to continue to exist, we would essentially be preserving one of Red Eye's accomplishments. \n \n As if he read her thoughts, Notebook piped up: 'I think we should tear it down. Blow it up and uncover the Stable beneath. In time, we might even be able to restore the Stable to proper functionality.' "
 fillysr_sl.18.a:0 "We could use it. Leave it standing."
 fillysr_sl.18.b:0 "Agree with Notebook and order it to be demolished."
 
 fillysr_sl.19.t:0 "Red Eye Apologists"
 fillysr_sl.19.d:0 "Recently, a group calling themselves the 'Guardians of Truth' have started campaigning against our government, on the grounds of our 'unfair' treatment of Red Eye and his supporters. The Guardians claim that Red Eye had only the best of intentions for Equestria, and that slavery was only a means to an end. The Cathedral has become almost a site of pilgrimage for these weirdos, as they see it as a monument to Red Eye's greatness. Who could of called that one? Sadly, they aren't doing anything strictly harmful to our operations, so we have no grounds for a crackdown against them. Their chants of 'Red Eye Did Nothing Wrong' are getting annoying though."

These Scribes have worked tirelessly to restore Stable 101 to working order, with some success.

 fillysr_sl.22.t:0 "The 200 Trials"
 fillysr_sl.22.d:0 "The trials were to be held in the very arena where Red Eye had once forced slaves to fight one another to the death. Strawberry thought it a good way to show all of Fillydelphia that the tides had turned, and that the slavers would now be the ones living in fear. Fear of justice. 200 former slavers were assembled within cages once used to hold slaves, another twist of irony. Soon enough, they would be facing their trials. Though there was only one acceptable judgement: Death.\n\nAs the first slaver was led in, the assembled crowd of spectators erupted into a mixture of cheering and insults. Many of those watching were once slaves, and now they were finally watching their former tormentors get their just dues. The slavers would be tried in order of their approximate ranks, with the highest ranking lieutenants we could capture going first. Red Eye's former pupil, Protégé, was the first among them to go. His crimes might not have been as attrocious as many of the other slavers, but his close connection to Red Eye made him iconic in a sense. Just as Red Eye had died, so too would those who followed his twisted cause. Much to Strawberry's distaste, he kept his head held high as he approached the center of the arena. The crowd quieted as she stood up and spoke:\n\n'We are all here today to see justice be done. A justice that is long overdo. The ponies before you are all guilty of some of the worst atrocities to have ever been committed on Equestrian soil, and it is about time that they face the consequences of their crimes. Before us now stands Protégé, one of Red Eye's most trusted and most loyal lieutenants. Even now, he refuses to show any ounce of shame for the horrors he helped inflict upon his fellow ponies. Ponies that include some of you here today, might I add. Protégé, you stand accused of five counts of crimes against ponykind, two counts of war crimes, and one count of treason against Equestria. Protocol would dictate that I ask how you plead, but I think we all know how this will end. So in the interest of saving all of our time, I hereby sentence you to death. May you rot in Tartarus.' \n The sound of the gunshot that would end Protégé's life could hardly be heard over the cheering of the crowd."

 fillysr_sl.23.d:0 "Strawberry stared at the list lying on the table in front of her. It held the names of 200 notable ponies who had supported and worked for Red Eye, all of who which currently sat in a a makeshift prison. They had been enemies during the war, yes, but not all of them were evil. Some never even interacted with the more distasteful parts of Red Eye's buisness, while others choose to try and make the best of the situation they were in. Of course, there were also those who were irredeemable. Ponies who had committed terrible acts for their own sadistic enjoyment, or only to enrich themselves.\n\nThe original plan had been to sentence them all to death, regardless of the extent of their involvement. However, she just couldn't bring herself to sign the order. Those who were evil, those who wish to harm Equestria, they deserved to die, sure. But how could she kill ponies that acted with genuinely good intentions or were just hostages to the situation? She pushed the list away from herself. She would request a more detailed one, with each potential executee interrogated beforehoof. Then she could decide in good conscience who would live and who would die. Perhaps some of them could even be extended an offer of redemption and reintegrated into society."

 fillysr_sl.24.d:0 "A small conference table had been brought into the most intact suite of the Alpha-Omega Hotel. 6 ponies were sitting at it: on one side, Elder Strawberry Lemonade, flanked by Scribe Notebook Scribble on the left, and Star Paladin Vanilla Swirl on the right.\n\nOpposite to them were Flintstone, leader of the 'Fillydelphia Freecorps'. They were the largest slave militia to form in the wake of Red Eye's defeat. To Flintstone's left, Onyx Lair. Onyx had but a few weeks ago tried to proclaim the 'Free State of Fillydelphia'. To Flintstone's right, a freshly risen spokespony for the slaves, False Hope. Notebook had laughed when he heard the rather ironic name of the slaves leader, but False Hope had turned out to be an exellent public speaker, although idealistic to a fault.\n\n'Well then', Strawberry started, 'As you all know, we come togheter today to discuss the future of Fillydelphia.'\n\nOnyx Lair wrinkled his brows. 'Well, a good start would be to stop occupying our city!' he near shouted. Vanilla was quick to interject: 'It is our city as well. We freed you!' Flintstone jumped onto the table, causing the guards to draw their weapons, before joining in with 'You just intend to oppress us too! Just cause you don't call it slavery, doesn't mean you aren't trying to force your will upon us!'\n\nStrawberry shook her head at the infamously quick-to-anger earth pony. 'Please calm down. You misunderstand our intent. We are trying to restore Equestria to the way it was before the war. A world where everypony is free and allowed to pursue their own interests in life. And unlike Red Eye, I do not intend to use slaves to do so. Please, help me make that dream come true.'\n\nAfter a moment of silence, False Hope finally spoke up. 'I think we should give them a chance.'"

The document in question is a series of 6 Conditions, which would need to be fulfilled in order for the former Slaves to accept Strawberry and her rangers as the rightful government over Fillydelphia. \n Number 1: All former slaves and their descendents are guarranteed full citizenship within the new nation. \n Number 2: Freedom of movement within the nation is a right of every citizen. \n Number 3: The practice of slavery is outlawed under threat of death. \n Number 4: At least 15% of government positions must be filled by former slaves, until the year 1265. \n Number 5: Local governments within Fillydelphia must be elective. \n Number 6: The new nation must have an undisputed Constitution in order to enshrine the rights of its citizens.\n\nAll things considered, they were fairly reasonable demands. If agreeing to them ensured that the former slaves would cooperate, it would be worth it."

 fillysr_sl.27.d:0 "With the deaths of both Red Eye and Stern, the Talons found themselves out of the job. Some of them had joined remnants of Red Eye's forces in raiding and pillaging to survive, while others had tried to stick together as one company. The leader of this second group was a rather large black griffon by the name of Ragini. The griffon herself entered Strawberry's office. She had requested a meeting with the Elder to discuss the future of those Talons that remained. The two leaders wasted no time getting right down to business.\n\n'Elder Strawberry, I would like to offer our services to you and your people. My Talons are some of the finest soldiers around, and we would be more than glad to serve your cause. I request you purchase our contract at a discounted rate, and allow us to join your military.'\n\nThe griffon sounded desperate, which was no surprise. After all, the last report Strawberry had received had claimed that the Ragini's company only had a few dozen griffons in it, at most. A far cry from the massive mercenary army that had once existed under Stern. Her forces and her would be of minimal use to our military. Yet they had nowhere else to go, and this could go a long way towards smoothing out pony-griffon relations."

The challenge came in trying to keep its structural integrity while still getting through it. After all, it wouldn't do to have it collapse onto our workers heads. Insignias and propaganda once belonging to Red Eye had already been carefully removed, erasing any trace of his rule. Soon, a ceremony would be held in which the new opening in the wall would be named 'Vanilla Gate'. It would serve as a monument in honor of the Star Paladin who had first breached the wall with her most capable ponies. It would also serve as the beginning of a campaign of resettlement aimed at reducing the cramped conditions in Fillydelphia. Former slaves would be offered open land in the countryside to create farms on. This would hopefully have the effect of increasing food production, and staving of famine."

 fillysr_sl.32.d:0 "The Hinterlands had previously proven to be rather difficult to integrate into our nation. Luckily for us, enterprising citizens and immigrants are happily settling there and intermingling with the locals. They build towns, which then elect mayors. Those mayors then help us ensure everypony is paying their taxes. Those taxes then pay for their protection, roads, and post offices. As the process of civilization continued, the Hinterlands grew more and more tame. We believe they would be firmly within our control by the end of the year."

She felt near as giddy as she did when she had first won the Chapter's election, all that time ago. Another deep breath, as she heard Scribe Notebook finish the opening statements. One final breath, and she walked out onto the stage. A sea of ponies stretched before her, a mass of every color under the sun. On either side stood two Paladins, ready to intervene should something go wrong. She approached the podium and began to speak:\n\n'Citizens of Fillydelphia! Liberated slaves and my Brothers and Sisters alike! You have all given much to see us to this day. All of us here have sacrificed something, lost someone, in order to make it here today. But now that we have made it, our future looks brighter than ever before! We have overcome trial after trial, all in the name of protecting what is good and right! For that, I thank you!' A pause, as cheering filled the air. 'However, our work is not yet done! Fillydelphia is free, but Equestria lies in ruins. Her people continue to suffer, with lives full of misery and suffering! Misery such as what Red Eye had once inflicted here, upon the good ponies of Fillydelphia. And just as we have liberated the ponies of Fillydelphia, so too shall we liberate the ponies of Equestria! For Equestria shall be restored, with us as its saviors! From this moment onwards, Applejack's Rangers shall be no more. We shall henceforth be known as the Equestrian Reclamation Front. And I, as the highest ranking member of the Equestrian government, shall assume the role of Grand Regent until such a time when the rightful Princesses may retake their thrones!'"

None of the Scribes and few of the former slaves had any concrete ideas on how it should be worded, and what exactly should be contained within it. The original 6 Demands were the first thing to be listed, as to appease them. After that, we made sure to include Strawberry Lemonade's position as Grand Regent of Equestria. A claim to being the rightful owner of all Equestrian land and property had been thrown in next, in order to help provide a basis for our planned future reclamation efforts. After that, many more ideas were thrown around, but none were considered necessary enough to be included. After days of ideas being thrown around, False Hope brought the process to a close by proposing that the Constitution be malleable, with the capability of being amended at anytime. For now, it would remain as is: a document that affirms the 6 Demands and our authority. But who knows what it could evolve into in the future?"

In an attempt to mitigate the possible impact integration efforts may have on our economy, we have decided to trust our Office of Colonial Affairs with establishing a colony to oversee the development and integration of our newly conquered northern territories.

As a result, we have prepared an ultimatum to be sent to them, demanding their willing and peaceful annexation. Alternatively, we could skip the pleasantries and just take their land by force."

Even though over 200 years have passed since the War, bad farming conditions, political instability, and the lingering radiation have made it hard to maintain large populations. Within our borders, most of these problems have been solved. Yet, population growth-rates have not increased as much as we had expected. It is therefore in the best interest of the government to support families that actively participate in repopulating Equestria.\n\nTo go about this, we have decided to offer large payments to any family with 4 or more children. This would both encourage the production of offspring, and make it easier for larger families to survive. The idea has also been thrown around to raise that number to 6, in the interest of encouraging even larger families."

They were comprised mainly of slaves that had managed to scrap together some influence with the slavers, and would use that influence to help their fellow slaves. However, they always demanded a price in exchange for their assistance. Those who couldn't pay... well, they were often assigned to the most dangerous shifts.\n\nThe Unions didn't end with Red Eye. Instead, they have evolved into more organized entities, that are now claiming to be much more in line with the traditional image of a union.

'What is it!?', she asked the nearest one.\n\n'Hostile EFS Signature, less than 200m away.'

 fillysr_sl.58.d:0 "Professor Cabbage had never felt so cold in her entire life. It was as if the weather itself was trying to pull every last iota of warmth out of her with a malicious intent. She thought back to the stories her parents told her about the Windigoes and the unnatural cold they supposedly could produce, but then shook her head. They were not in a little fillies tale. This was real, and they clearly had made the wrong decision. She silently hoped that at least someone would find their bodies one day and return them home. With a soft buzzing, another heater gave up its flame, snuffed out by a cold that would not cease until all of them were dead."
 fillysr_sl.58.a:0 "The bodies wouldn't be found for centuries."

 fillysr_sl.59.d:0 "They were close, oh so close to Crystallia when the storm hit them.\n If they had been two or so hours faster, they could of been safe within the insulated walls of the outpost... but they hadn't. They could try to push on, and make it to the outpost even in the storm, but visibility was terrible, and there was no guarantee they would even walk in the right direction. Maybe they should seek shelter in one of the nearby caves... at least it would keep the wind out, though it would still be bitterly cold."

It appears that they had attempted to take refuge within a cave inhabited by an ursa minor. We believe their Knights were the first to be killed by the beast, with the rest of their expedition following soon afterwards. The beast itself succumbed to it's injuries. Arrangements will be made to return their bodies home. \n From: Chief Spot of Crystallia"

 fillysr_sl.61.d:0 "Professor Cabbage wanted to start crying from joy when she finally made out the lights marking one of the entrances into the outpost. While her tears instantly froze on her fur, she knocked at the door, before collapsing near it. As the door opened, and the first of them started moving in, one of the knights picked her up and carried her inside. A wave of warmth washed over her, and she could feel the fingers of death loosing their grasp on her. And while it felt oh, so wonderful to be inside, it also made her realize how tired she truly was, and how only survival had pushed her forward for these last few hours.\n\n'We... we made it.', she softly said, before her eyes fell shut from exhaustion. The next morning, she would find out, that two of their expedition had never reached the outpost, and were most likely dead in the mountains. 12 of them had frotbite and would need to be treated, but nopony was in mortal danger anymore. And while she cried for those who were lost, she said a silent prayer to Celestia and Luna, thanking them for at least saving the rest."

 fillysr_sl.62.t:0 "Crystallia"
 fillysr_sl.62.d:0 "Outpost Crystallia was a weather and radar station during the War. It was built into the southern side of Mt. Crystallia, the highest mountain in the Canterlot Mountain Range. Even after over 200 years, its air-seals showed no signs of deterioration, still looking brand new. As the Professor moved through the outpost, she saw the ponies of her expetidion interacting with the resident dogs that had made the outpost their home. Some seemed tense, but most were friendly with eachother. Not that either side could afford conflict in such a dangerous area. She turned to head towards the archives, when she spotted an old gray dog, sitting at a fire. He was apparently telling a story to some younger dogs, as well as some of her Scribes."

 fillysr_sl.63.d:0 "The Archives were not a small library, like Cabbage had imagined, but instead a single console in front of a large monitor. As she touched the console, the screen flickered to life, displaying thousands upon thousands of automated weather reports for the last 200+ years. Curious at to what it would say, Cabbage scrolled back to the report from the Day that the world had ended.\n\nClear skies for the most part, but an unscheduled cloudy overcast later in the day. That must have been when the pegasi closed up the sky for good, dammned traitors. As she looked through the rest of the data for the day, one point caught her eye: 'Impact of megaspell-capable missile detected 4 Kilometers west, no explosion recorded.' An undetonated missile, maybe even recoverable..."
 fillysr_sl.63.a:0 "I need to see that."
 
 fillysr_sl.64.t:0 "Stories of Yore"
 fillysr_sl.64.d:0 "The old dog looked at her with eyes that displayed a wisdom only gained from a long life. 'Come, join us by the fire and hear of our stories.' he said, as the others made room for her.\n\n'Where was I? Ahh, yes the day of green fire, when Gods died and the sun went away, never to be seen again. Our ancestors have told many stories about said day: Great heroes who tried and failed to stop the destruction, the heroic sacrifice of Luna, the great Blood-Comet in the sky that nearly hit this very mountain, the...' Cabbage perked up at that, and quickly interjected: 'The Great Blood-Comet?' The old dog smiled. 'Yes, a great bloodred comet streaked low through the skies, almost hitting this very mountain and ending it. They say it crashed one more peak westward.' Cabbage was speechless. It couldn't be... A megaspell-missile from the zebras? And it sounded like it crashed nearby without exploding..."
 fillysr_sl.64.a:0 "I need to see that."
 
 fillysr_sl.65.t:0 "Bloodstone Valley"
 fillysr_sl.65.d:0 "After talking to several of the dogs, Professor Cabbage determined that the ominously named 'Bloodstone Valley' was the missile impact site. Now, the expedition and a small escort of dogs from Crystallia had set off for a short excursion there. It was only a couple of hours from the outpost, and the weather had cleared up enough that their travel should be safe.\n\nThrough her slightly-frosted glasses, the valey was blindingly white, and she Started to fear that the missile was irrecoverable, under who knows how much snow. But she had an idea: Since this missile was most likely carrying a balefire megaspell, it would give off a large amount of magical radiation, and could be found that way. Not two hours into searching, one of their instruments picked up unusually high radiation, and so they began to dig through the snow..."
 fillysr_sl.65.a:0 "We've found it."
 
 fillysr_sl.66.t:0 "The Missile"
 fillysr_sl.66.d:0 "It was a thing of savage beauty, a symbol of both the height of progress and the destruction of the world. Though it had seen better days: only the warhead itself survived, and it looked to have been substantially damaged in the impact. Still, it was as large as a truck and bearing the most dangerous cargo in the world. As a precaution, Cabbage two extra RadSafe before approaching the warhead. She admired the precise construction for a moment, before going to work.\n\nThe first thing she did was open the manual emergency panel. All megaspells had these, you wouldn't want to built a bomb with no way of shutting it off in case of an emergency after all. The tiny screen only displayd a few numbers, but from what cabbage could make out, the spellchamber was damaged and could not be turned off or reused. However, the spellcore was still fully intact. Without the spellchamber, they would essentially get an empty spellcore, but those could still be immensly useful for other purposes. However, something was bothering the Professor: Why was it all the way out here? There was no reason to hit a weather station, and Canterlot was too far away for the missile to be aimed at the Capital... Maybe it was aimed at this very spot?\n Maybe there was something below the ice...\n The only way to quickly find out would be to set the megaspell to detonate in a few days, get to the safety of the outpost, and then return to see what it had laid free. Of course, this also runs the risk of destroying whatever is underneath."
 fillysr_sl.66.a:0 "It's worth the risk. Set it to detonate."
 fillysr_sl.66.b:0 "Just salvage the spellcore."
 
 fillysr_sl.67.t:0 "KABOOOOM!!!"
 fillysr_sl.67.d:0 "The world turned a sickly green for a second, as the balefire bomb detonated a couple kilometers away. Mere seconds later, the resulting shockwave hit the outpost, rattling bolts and windows, but it had been made to withstand such forces. The levels of magical radiation spiked for several minutes, before the primary radiation started to fade. The secondary radiation would persist for centuries, but it shouldn't affect the dogs at the outpost. As such, no lasting harm was done.\n\nDonning one of the few radsuits the outpost had in storage, Cabbage and a few members of her expedition in either similar suits or insulated Power armor made their way to the detonation site. Wheras yesterday there had laid a warhead in a snowy valley, there now was a snow-free valley of scorched rock. The balefire's immense power was more than enough to melt away the snow and ice. What caught her eye however, was a large metal door, similar to the stable-doors back at the Stable-Tec HQ. It was warped in its holdings, but clearly had been sturdy enough to survive the blast. This was it! A hidden Equestrian facility, deep in the mountains. Not even the Stable-Tec Maneframe had data on this facility..."

The facilities maneframe revealed it to be a a host to over 2000 experimental clones of various Equestrian soldiers. Apparently the Ministry of Arcane Science was trying to create soldiers in order to win the war. Mass production efforts had failed, and only a few clones of each subject were created successfully. They were currently being kept in cyropods, just waiting for the awaken order to be given. An order that had never been given."

 fillysr_sl.69.d:0 "Professor Cabbage couldn't believe her eyes when she saw it: A miniature sun, maybe 50 meters across, was lazily hovering within the heart of the facility. Tendrils of bright orange energy extended from it to six mountings in the walls, where its energy was siphoned off. Another funnel fed it fresh water from an underground reservoir, preventing it from overheating. A device that produced as much energy as an entire powerplant, small enough to put one into every neighborhood, and only needing water to balance it. Equestria had been tantalizingly close to solving all of its energy problems...and then the world ended."

 fillysr_sl.70.d:0 "Cabbage carefully positioned the blue talisman onto the shooting target. After she moved to a safe distance, a Knight opened fire with his saddle-mounted machine gun.\n\nBefore a single bullet could hit the target, the talisman began to glow. A bright blue shield sprang up around the target, enveloping it in a bubble. The shield seemed to be made up of both hexagons and pentagons, forming an almost perfect sphere around the talisman and the target. The first few bullets sent tiny, rippling waves through the shield where they hit, but once they touched the shield, they lost all their momentum and harmlessly fell to the ground. A few more momenets of sustained fire later, the shield collapsed, and the target was ripped apart by a storm of lead.\n\nIt seems that this had been a Ministry of Arcane Science project to try and reproduce Zebrican talisman technology. While they had only limited success, they were able to invent their own shield talisman. It wouldn't be that difficult to mass produce these, provided that we had enough crystals..."

It seems that they are asking for citizenship, in exchange for the services they have provided us thus far. If we were to extend citizenship to them, it would extend to all diamond dogs. Hellhounds, being the abominations they are, have no place within our Equestria and would be exempt from this. However, not everyone is convinced that dogs deserve full citizenship..."

Ones that have kept their sanity, and are fully capable of being productive members of society. The question has now been raised as to whether or not we should accept them as full citizens of Equestria.\n\nOn one hoof, many of them have centuries worth of valuable knowledge. Some of them even remember what Equestria was like before the War, and were full citizens back then. On the other, they do still run the risk of going feral at any time. Can we really trust that they won't wake up on the wrong side of the bed on morning and decide to eat ponies?"

Luna had defended Canterlot to her last, trying to protect her ponies as best she could. But even the Goddesses had failed to stop the War that so abruptly ended the world...\n Strawberry knew that the alicorns were truly dead, but the population was caught in the belief that they simply ascended to a higher plane and were still watching from above. She could use that to her advantage, but she was still strangely sad to see this skeleton. Strawberry shook her head, banishing the sadness to the back of her mind.

The cold winds they ushered in flowed through the streets of the city perched atop Mount Canter.\n A low drum beat accompanied the stiff breeze, echoing through the ancient streets of the Equestrian Capital, thousands of silent ponies having clustered along the cobble lined roads to watch the solemn procession proceeding through the hallowed metropolis. They continued on through the winding streets, past the opulent homes of the former garden district to the more modest abodes in the lower district. The procession continued onward, accompanied by the ever present beat of the eight military snare drums that trailed behind it.\n On any other day, they would of been an awe inspiring sight: hulking silver clad forms of Equestria's greatest warriors, shepherded along by robe clad ponies that composed the Order of the Quill. However, these auspicious figures were not what drew the attention of the masses. It was not the shining armor, the famed soldiers, or the brightest minds left in the Wastes that drew the crowds that solemnly lined the streets.\n It was the coffin they held above them, the sarcophagus they so reverently conveyed through the streets of Canterlot. The casket itself was a relatively simple construct for all the attention it demanded, the charcoal black box's only true indication of importance being the silver half moon emblazoned upon its side to indicate the individual interred within.

The procession had passed through the city, leaving the Royal Palace and proceeding down the mountain to the lower districts, before finally arching back up to pass through the garden district. They passed through the ruins of the city in silence, only the beating of the drums and the everpresent wind serving to break the silence. The march finally concluded as they passed through Ministry Row, finally conveying the mortal form of their ruler back to her rightful place, the Palace.\n Strawberry was a paragon of neutrality as the coffin approached the former throne of the Lunar Diarch, an opening having been carved out of the marble at its base in preparation for this moment. With a nod from Notebook Scribble, the Scribes that had accompanied the procession finally stepped in to play their role, igniting their horns simultaneously to lift the sarcophagus off the backs of their brethren, guiding it through the air to suspend it above the grave made within the floor. The Paladins stepped back, taking up the position of a ceremonial guard around the grave itself.\n With a single decisive nod from Strawberry, the coffin was slowly lowered into the ground, the faded marble floor providing a striking contrast to the black coffin descending into it. Finally, it reached the bottom of the grave, the Scribes releasing their magical grip and stepping back, their work completed. Notebook took a moment to stare down into the grave before lowering his head, his horn glowing once more as the hole began to heal, the marble creeping over the sarcophagus interred below.\n Inscribed on this patch of marble was a simple commemoration: \n \n 'Here lies our eternal Goddess of the Night, Princes Luna. May she guide our actions from above.' \n \n He finally looked up, meeting Strawberry's eyes for a moment before breaking the silence. 'Long live the Grand Regent.' "
