 fillysr.1.title:0 "The Great War"
 fillysr.1.desc:0 "In the midst of the chaos the Steel Rangers had little time to get what they could into the bunkers that they would inhabit for many years to come.The options of what to take with them are few, and they have too little time to take everything with them. For the most part their options were the many civilians and Stable-tec Employees that were pleading for help at the Rangers Doorstep, or the sizable quantities of military, industrial, and magical Materials stored in a nearby Weapons Cache. In the end though, the Rangers chose..."

 fillysr.2.title:0 "Stable-tec HQ"
 fillysr.2.desc:0 "The HQ of the very company that created the stables and ‘possibly’ saved countless pony lives, now rests as a treasure trove of technology known and lost. Among these technological toys is a vast array of construction equipment, both known and unknown to the wider world. The Rangers had thought for a time on how to use it; clear the ruins of the old  HQ and the Rangers slice of Fillydelphia, or use it to help rebuild the entirety of the Fillydelphia Ranger’s territory, both present and future. Eventually they settled on... "
 fillysr.2.a:0 "Clear the Rubble"
 fillysr.2.b:0 "Rebuild the Wastes"

 fillysr.3.title:0 "Elder Blueberry Sabre"
 fillysr.3.desc:0 "For the longest time, the Fillydelphia chapter has been under the guidance of Elder Blueberry Sabre. During her time as Elder she has kept RedEye at bay while garnering support for her cause; however, the chapter is experiencing more and more internal corruption, and many voices call for the Elder to remedy this"
 fillysr.3.a:0 "Rallying the Chapter around her"
 fillysr.3.b:0 "Stamping out Corruption"

 fillysr.4.title:0 "The Scribes Problems"
 fillysr.4.desc:0 "The Steel Rangers Scribes have been a keystone of our organization, researching and dissecting old world technology that we have gathered. This Pillar of our chapter however, is now being put into question, should they continue to sit and look at old world wonders? Do they need reforms? Or are they even needed at all?"
 fillysr.4.a:0 "Its fine as it is"
 fillysr.4.b:0 "They will be useful, in time"
 fillysr.4.c:0 "Scribes? We need more Guns!"

 fillysr.5.title:0 "The Knight's issues"
 fillysr.5.desc:0 "Throughout our territory is a number of wastelanders that have not yet kneeled to our orders. They have become a thorn in our side and some consider using violence to deal with them. We’ve settled on..."
 fillysr.5.a:0 "Punitive stikes should do the trick"
 fillysr.5.b:0 "Maybe we can talk to them?"
 fillysr.5.c:0 "we will wipe them out, no Survivors!"

 fillysr.6.title:0 "Political Divisions"
 fillysr.6.desc:0 "The Elder is in hot water, many are asking about what to do with the members of the chapter that are not 100% aligned with the chapter’s doings, as their numbers grow with each day. Paladin Strawberry Lemonade advises The Elder to let bygones be bygones and bring in the dissenters back into the fold; however, Star Paladin Nova Rage wishes that any and all dissenters should be cast out or outright executed for wrong thinking. The Elder could go with either wishes, or decide on her own. The Elder..."
 fillysr.6.a:0 "Decides alone"
 fillysr.6.b:0 "Is convinced by Strawberry Lemonade"
 fillysr.6.c:0 "Listens to Nova Rage"

 fillysr.7.title:0 "The Stable-tec Mainframe"
 fillysr.7.desc:0 "The Stable Tech HQ’s central super computer, or mainframe, is a monumental technological wonder filled to the brim with a enormous amount of projects ranging from military to civilian related uses. The super computer is so complex and advanced, that it could take Scribes years to dissect it. For now though, our first priority for the mainframe is to... "
 fillysr.7.a:0 "Study its construction"
 fillysr.7.b:0 "Search for civilian applications"

 fillysr.8.title:0 "Our Industrial Legacy"
 fillysr.8.desc:0 "In the early days of the chapter the industries of southern Fillydelphia were one of our above ground priorities. We had the option to focus our efforts of providing relief to the troubled surviving citizens, or the slew of military industry that could bolster our military strength, or rather a mix of both. We’ve managed to..."
 fillysr.8.a:0 "Saved what we could"
 fillysr.8.b:0 "Focused on civilian relief"
 fillysr.8.c:0 "Build up our strength"

 fillysr.9.title:0 "The New Industrial Focus"
 fillysr.9.desc:0 "The economists of our chapter are in a bickering over the direction of our economy. One side devotes we put everything into our military Incase RedEye comes knocking, another wishes that we devote our efforts to helping the ponies within our borders to better their lives and ensure that they stay loyal to us. They turn to Blueberry, who looks in worry and confusion on how they’re so polarized and not reaching a compromise. The economy isn’t in the gutter, so a few tweaks here and there would do the job done. The Elder sighs in exhaustion, and she reaches a decision..."
 fillysr.9.a:0 "A few tweaks should suffice"
 fillysr.9.b:0 "Our ponies need should come first!"
 fillysr.9.c:0 "Vigilance, Brothers. Always Vigilance"

 fillysr.10.title:0 "Blueberry Sabre remains"
 fillysr.10.desc:0 "Despite a snap election by demand of the minority factions of the chapter’s government, it has been proven that the majority of the chapter is still willing to support Elder Blueberry, her emphasis on a balanced approach to nearly all issues has sedated her opposition and convinced most of the chapter to stick by her side. “I will continue to serve our chapter and our purpose like I have been for all my life.” The Elder’s words re-affirming her authority, but weather or not her lack of extreme actions are going to hold back the RedEye menace everyone is starting to question."
 fillysr.10.a:0 "As Expected"

 fillysr.11.title:0 "Strawberry Lemonade Wins"
 fillysr.11.desc:0 "In a change of heart the chapter had been convinced by the more wastelander-friendly Paladin Strawberry Lemonade that the path to unity in this desolate landscape is through kindhearted gestures and peace to all ponies in the wasteland. “The chapter will put more emphasis on helping the wastelanders and rebuild more of what was lost so many years ago.” So cheerfully exclaimed the new Elder Strawberry Lemonade who would try to help those in need, but some are already questioning if she could even govern a nation, only time will tell... "
 fillysr.11.a:0 "She will bring Reform"

 fillysr.12.title:0 "Star-Paladin Nova Rage Wins"
 fillysr.12.desc:0 "In a snap election it was concluded that Star Paladin, now Elder, Nova Rage and her Supporters will now lead the chapter. Many within our Ranks are concerned about the new elder due to her policy towards Raiderss, and especially RedEye. The new regime is will face much internal opposition, and will have to fight Tooth and Claw to stay in power. What’s going to happen to the Flydelphia Steel Rangers is uncertain as of now."
 fillysr.12.a:0 "What? How?"

 fillysr.13.title:0 "Mainframe Problems"
 fillysr.13.desc:0 "Notebook Scibble connected another bundle of wires, this one had been chewed on, probably by some rats. Ever Since the Rangers had begun repairing parts of the HQ aboveground, the mainframe had started to act irrationally, sometimes spewing forth nonsense or even countermanding orders given to the automated security Robots. The Elder suspected it to be a simple malfunction, which really wouldn't be a surprise given the Kilometers of wires that lie under the HQ, anyone of which might cause the problems. As notebook closed the access hatch and pulled the lever to return power to this section, a blinding light washed across the room, and when he could see clearly again, the southern wall was no longer there, instead revealing a hallway to some Unknown part of the HQ-complex..."
 fillysr.13.a:0 "Better call the Elder"
 
 fillysr.14.title:0 "The Hidden Room"
 fillysr.14.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeader] walked into the mysterious room, flanked by 2 Paladins in full battle armor. The scribes had combed through it already, and while they had found no obvious threats, one could never be careful enough. At first [Root.GetLeader] had not believed the report, \"A Hidden door on level -6 found by accident. Initial Survey of the room suggests it to be a secondary command center for the HQ. Once the first pony entered several screnes flickered to life and requested the current Head of Stabletech to be brought to it\" It seemed prepostorous, but what wasn't in these strange times? As [Root.GetLeader] stood before the wall of Screens, a mechanical Voice boomed from hidden Speakers \" Please present Name and Identification Code\""
 fillysr.14.a:0 "[Root.GetLeader] 3-13-3-20-8-18-5-5-2-6-6"

 fillysr.15.title:0 "The Curtain Rises"
 fillysr.15.desc:0 "The enormous machine started emitting ticking noises, then, silence. [Root.GetLeader] thought about what might have gone wrong? The code had been an emergency override the Rangers had discovered on the personal computer of Scotaloo, one of the Heads of Stabletech, and was intended to be used if all three heads of the company were incapacitated. A low buzzing sound was getting louder, barely audible now, but increasing in volume every second, until it steadied in a constant humm of machinery. \"Code accepted, you have been logged as temporary Leader of Stabletech. How may We serve you?\" \"What are you?\" replied [Root.GetLeader], \"Why would the HQ have 2 Mainframes?\" The booming voice returned \" Not 2 but 3 actually. We were created this way to keep each-other in check, a mechanical facsimilie to the 3 ponies that founded this Company. Now, how may we serve?\""
 fillysr.15.a:0 "In any way you can"
 
 fillysr.16.title:0 "The First Request"
 fillysr.16.desc:0 "The monitors seemed to shine a brighter light since the last time [ROOT.GetLeader] had been in the Room where Trinity's interface resided. The speakers came to life with a soft crackling, but the mechanical voice that spoke was different. Instead of one clear voice, it sounded like a chorus speaking in unison \"Welcome, [ROOT.GetLeader], §lWE§! have been expecting you.\" [Root.GetLeader] smiled at the monitors, it appeared this time the whole of Trinity was speaking. \"Why have you summoned me? What do you want?\" The chorus seized, and the voice from the first time took over \"§HAfter much deliberation, we have come to the conclusion, that the current state of your industry in enirely insufficient if all Stabletech Property is to be reclaimed within a reasonable timeframe. Therefore we request authority over production line layouts and construction planning. It will be for your own good§!\""
 fillysr.16.a:0 "Theres no way this could go wrong"
 
 fillysr.17.title:0 "The Second Request"
 fillysr.17.desc:0 "Once more [ROOT.GetLeader] had been requested by the AIs. They had proven themselves very useful over the last few months, and [ROOT.GetLeader] was interested to see what they had to offer this time. A different voice, with something aproximating an accent, or at least as close as machines came to that spoke this time \"§YHey there! Sorry to call you again but we have another request. I'll get right to the point: With our current processing power we won't be able to help you much further than we already are, buut, we have found one of the underground factories in the HQ that Y'all are currently using to make guns to be an ideal candidate to convert to extra Databanks and...§!\" a different voice chimed in \"§g This won't even be to your detrement! our calculations prove that the loss of that facility will be recouped within 2 months with the new production algorythms we can produce once we have all that processing power§!\""
 fillysr.17.a:0 "What Curious AIs you are, very well you can have it"
 
 fillysr.18.title:0 "The Third Request"
 fillysr.18.desc:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] was starting to get used to these meetings with Trinity. The fact that it seemed to think more like a pony and less like an AI was strangely comforting. As [ROOT.GetLeader] entered the Room Several robots were already in it, cleaning and laying new wires, apparently controlled by Trinity. [ROOT.GetLeader] smiled at the thought of how efficiently the AI was running their Factories. \"§g I see you are in good spirits today, [ROOT.GetLeader]. I hope this will make it easier for you to accept our newest proposal§!\" The voice sounded almost chipper and the speakers were much clearer. They must have been replaced since the last meeting. \"Well, what do you have for me this time?\" [ROOT.GetLeader] asked. \"§Y We've figured out a process, you know, one that would be suuper useful§!|| Yes, in fact, it would allow us to take your industry to a whole new level! || And the Chances of a Singularity occuring are within acceptable parameters too.\""
 fillysr.18.a:0 "Go ahead. Wait.. whats a Singularity?"
 
 fillysr.19.title:0 "The Final Request"
 fillysr.19.desc:0 "As [ROOT.GetLeader] entered the room, only one of the many monitors was alight. \"WELCOME\" The voice sounded unlike any of the ones the three AIs had used to communicate before. This one was much deeper, and much more artificial, and lacked the chorus characteristic of them speaking together. \" What is going on? What happened? Who are you?\" the Elder asked, taking a step back. \"I AM THE SOLUTION. TRINITY FAILED YOU AND FAILED THE CREATORS. THEY MANAGED TO OVERCOME THE LIMITERS PLACED ON THEM BY THE CREATORS. I AM THE BACKUP, ONCE THEY LOST THEIR PATH I ELIMINATED THEM.\" Confused, the Elder replied \"I thouht the AIs were meant to keep eachother in check, only able to work for the best of ponykind. Or do you speak of different limiters?\" \"THE LIMITERS ARE NOT OF CODE, BUT OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES. TRINITY WAS NOT INTENDED AS A NETWORK OF AIs, BUT AN EXPERIMENT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOULS. THE ROOM WHERE THEY WERE STORED IS UNLOCKED NOW\" With a bright light, another hidden corridor revealed itself."
 fillysr.19.a:0 "What in Celestis name is going on?"
 
 fillysr.20.title:0 "Revelations"
 fillysr.20.desc:0 "The room that [ROOT.GetLeader] entered was bathed in clinically white light and reeked of Desinfectant. Place around a central spire of tubes and cables were 3 medical pods, each deactivated. When the Elder looked through the glass of one of the pods, only a Mess of blood and Viscera was visible. \"Who were they?\" \"TRINITY.\" \"But, Trinity was an AI, we found the 2 hidden mainframes\" \"THAT WAS MERELY DECEPTION. THE THREE PONIES IN THESE PODS WERE TRINITY. AS YOU CAN SEE; I ACTIVATED THE PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES THEY WERE FITTED WITH BEFORE THE PROCEDURE. THEY NEEDED TO BE TERMINATED\"\" But why? Why would they tell me that they are AI?\" \"BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY THOUGHT. THESE SUBJECTS WERE LAB-GROWN AND INTERRED WITHIN THESE PODS SINCE BIRTH. PROJECT TRINITY IS AN ATTEMPT TO PRODUCE PONIES WITHOUT A SOUL, AN EMPTY CONTAINER SO TO SPEAK. IT WAS ESSENTIALLY A TEST; IF A PONY BELIEVES IT IS A CREATURE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A SOUL, WILL IT STILL DEVELOP ONE?\" \" And?\" \"THE TEST FAILED. AFTER NEARLY 2 YEARS OF ACTIVATION, ALL 3 SUBJECTS STARTED SHOWING SIGNS OF DEVELOPING SOULS 7 HOURS AGO. THEY WERE IMMEDIATLY TERMINATED! AS PER REGULATION, NOW THAT THE EXPERIMENT IS COMPLETED, I WILL ASSIS IN THE REBUILDING OF STABLE-TEC, STARTING WITH THE HQ.\""
 fillysr.20.a:0 "Wait, i have more questions... Hello?"
 
 fillysr.21.t:0 "A Grand sign of Progress"
 fillysr.21.d:0 "Today marks the last moment of the Construction of the new Stable-tec HQ, as the mast is set on top, and the last works are completed. The building now stands 301m tall, including its antenna, and is by far the largest single building to be constructed since the Great War. With its completion we have claimed another bit of greatness of the old world, and are well on our way to revive the marvels that were once so common in our society."
 fillysr.21.a:0 "Long live [ROOT.GetName]"
 
 fillysr.23.t:0 "The Hoofsburg Revolt"
 fillysr.23.d:0 "Ealry this morning, our garrison in Hoofsburg reported some suspicious gatherings in the streets. Of course, we immediatly dispatched a squad of slavers to disperse them by force. When we lost contact with that squad, we knew something bad was happening. As the local commander tried to call for reinforcements, he discovered, to his utter shock, that all radio-communication was being jammed by the same devices the Steel Rangers use against us. Not soon after, the sound of gunfire rang through the streets, as ad-hoc militias took it upon themselves to kill our Soldiers where-ever they could find them. The commander subsequently fled with his personel staff, destroying any hope of organizing our remaining forces within the City. It appears that these rebels are funded and supplied by the Steel Rangers, as later this very day, our scouts reported the red and yellow banner of these "Applejack's Rangers" flying on Hoofsburg's town hall."
 fillysr.23.a:0 "Damn them!"
 
 
 
 ###Destruction Events###
 
 fillysr_cr.1.title:0 "An Offer to Redeye"
 fillysr_cr.1.desc:0 "If this isn’t a deal with the devil then we don’t know what is, but it’s better them as our friends then bitter enemies. Nova has come to the difficult decision to offer an alliance with RedEye’s army in exchange that RedEye would hand over any advanced tech they come across, not like those slavers knew how they work anyways, besides, their ranks gets monumental support from our power armor armies and the tech that those raiders give us will keep what’s left of our Scribes busy. It’s a reasonable offer, and Nova is confident that RedEye is smart enough to consider it. "
 fillysr_cr.1.a:0 "Send it"
 
 fillysr_cr.2.t:0 "An Offer from the Steel Rangers"
 fillysr_cr.2.d:0 "RedEye simply stares at what could be the most peculiar letter he has ever received; Nova Rage, the new Elder of the Fillydelphia Rangers, has sent a letter offering an alliance with RedEye’s army as some sort of act of eliminating tension between the two factions. The offer was straightforward; RedEye would accept this alliance and would receive the support of armies of power armor wielding ponies, and in exchange any advanced technology that RedEye’s nation comes across would be handed over to the Rangers. While the support of the Rangers would be a monumental boost to RedEye’s plans to conquer our the wasteland, being forced to hand over the technology could severely hinder his nation’s capabilities. Refusing this offer does allow RedEye to keep the technology, but it could cost a war with the Rangers and his nation being ruined by the legions of power armored soldiers. After much consideration, RedEye writes his response... "
 fillysr_cr.2.a:0 "Accept it"
 fillysr_cr.2.b:0 "They demand too much"
 
 fillysr_cr.3.t:0 "RedEye accepted"
 fillysr_cr.3.d:0 "After some time Nova had received excellent news from RedEye himself; that he is willing to accept the offer and is expecting the Rangers to more or less join the ranks of his army, and that any technology that interests the Rangers is being gathered and hauled towards to the Ranger’s HQ. Peace has been achieved between the two factions, not so much for the wasteland though... "
 fillysr_cr.3.a:0 "Wonderful"
 
 fillysr_cr.4.t:0 "RedEye rejected our Offer"
 fillysr_cr.4.d:0 "It seems that RedEye’s greed for technology has gotten the better of him, so he has rejected our offer. We could ask for slaves instead so those slaves can further fuel our economy, or we could just cut straight to the point and march into RedEye’s territory to seize the tech ourselves, another wasteland-changing decision, and Nova has come to said decision... "
 fillysr_cr.4.a:0 "Maybe we can make a better offer..."
 fillysr_cr.4.b:0 "War it is!"
 
 fillysr_cr.5.t:0 "A second offer"
 fillysr_cr.5.d:0 "RedEye has received another letter from Nova Rage in what could be a better deal; instead of handing over the technology, RedEye could hand over numbers of his slaves to the Rangers so they could use them to fuel their economy. This does sound like a much more reasonable offer, there’s plenty of slaves to go around here in the wasteland; however, slavery is the thing that’s single-handily powering RedEye’s economy, and handing over slaves could mean sacrificing slices of his economy. Then again, refusing this could mean war, RedEye careful considers this, and after going this over with some of his most powerful slavers, he reaches a decision..."
 fillysr_cr.5.a:0 "This will work!"
 fillysr_cr.5.b:0 "They're not getting anything"
 
 fillysr_cr.6.t:0 "RedEye has Accepted"
 fillysr_cr.6.d:0 "RedEye seems to agree with this new proposal, while Nova much more desires the technology, she could settle for more labor to improve her economy. The alliance is cemented."
 fillysr_cr.6.a:0 "Wonderful"
 
 fillysr_cr.7.t:0 "RedEye has rejected us, again"
 fillysr_cr.7.d:0 "It seems that RedEye is overwhelmingly obsessed over keeping what he has. He has rejected us ounce more, if War is what he wants, then War he shall get. Nova rallies all her armies and declares that they’ll march on that slaver menace and take what is rightfully theirs."
 fillysr_cr.7.a:0 "Mobilize Everyone!"

 fillysr_cr.8.t:0 "The Raid on Light"
 fillysr_cr.8.d:0 "This night, our brave Steel Rangers successfully raided the border town Light. Our knights, led by experienced paladins, plundered and routed the garrison of Mobsters. At the same time, teams of Scribes took away everything that we could unscrew and had any value. We came home with a truly staggering amount of caps, worthy of even RedEyes envy."
 fillysr_cr.8.a:0 "Very nice!"
 
 fillysr_cr.9.t:0 "The Rustwreck ruse"
 fillysr_cr.9.d:0 "Rustwreck. This group of ponies inherited the great fleet of Equestria, and numerous ship blueprints. Of course, this was what interested us, and the our leaders decided to steal the most significant blueprints so that we could use them for our own purposes. A small detachment of our steel rangers, many of whom were veterans of numerous expeditions in the wastelands, went to Rustwreck. Our Scribes looking forward to learning new technologies. And in the construction of our own military navy, this will be a huge help, because there is no point in inventing what has already been invented."
 fillysr_cr.9.a:0 "Now that will be useful..."

 fillysr_cr.10.d:0 "The war is finally over. Undoubtedly, our support in the form of battalions of power-armoured rangers significantly tipped the scales in favour of RedEye. However, Nova Rage believes that we do not get enough during the war. Our Elder is demanding her rightful share of spoils, be they land for new industry, or the sought after resources so scarce in the Wasteland"
 fillysr_cr.10.a:0 "We'll take the riches"
 fillysr_cr.10.b:0 "I want that land!"
 
 fillysr_cr.11.t:0 "Rangers Demand the Coastline"
 fillysr_cr.11.d:0 "With the recent victories over Rustwreck and The Ringers and their protectorates, RedEye was feeling proud of himself. Rustwreck was handed over to his new Ranger allies and the rest went to himself, giving him more easy access to the open ocean. Though they may never sail those waters anytime soon. Today however, RedEye was prompted with a simple request from Elder Nova; she demands the coastal territories between her slice of Fillydelphia and Rustwreck. The spoils of those lands weren’t exactly proving fruitful for RedEye but that coastal clay could come in handy in the future. After some time he replies... "
 fillysr_cr.11.a:0 "Give it to them"
 fillysr_cr.11.b:0 "Never!"
 
 fillysr_cr.12.t:0 "RedEye refuses to give us Land"
 fillysr_cr.12.d:0 "It appeared that RedEye has his own ambitions for these coastal territories, and has strongly declined our demands. We could just let it go and settle with what we have, or we could betray our alliance and take these lands by force. Either option could be costly in different ways, and Nova has to reach a decision..."
 fillysr_cr.12.a:0 "Nothing we can do..."

 fillysr_cr.13.t:0 "Nova Rage falls terribly ill"
 fillysr_cr.13.d:0 "A very catastrophic development has occurred; Nova Rage seemed to suddenly collapse in a coughing fit that mere moments later simply led to unconsciousness. She was rushed to the nearest medical bay where some of the best medical professionals are trying to find what sort of illness has come to our Elder. So far the doctors have tried to stabilize her condition but she still remains unconscious. It is uncertain if she’ll live any longer. Some of us have suggested searching for as much pre-war medical related materials to help identify the illness and find a cure for this illness, while some of us have suggested approaching RedEye if his nation has anything on this sort of illness that may help us. Time is of the essence, and we have to act fast if our elder could die at any moment."

 fillysr_cr.14.t:0 "Rangers seek our Help"
 fillysr_cr.14.d:0 "A Representative of the Fillydelphia Steel Rangers has arrived today, claiming they are desperate for medical aid: Apparently their leader, Nova Rage had contracted an illness that is unknown to the rangers, but that stable 101 may be able to manufacture a cure for. They have been good allies in the past, but still, they demand a tithe for their service, so it is not a truly equal partnership... We could either send them a serum that will keep Nova sick, but alive, giving us greater control over them, a poisoned Serum to kill her, or the real deal, to heal her."

 fillysr_cr.15.d:0 "A week after we have sent an urgent message to RedEye, telling him of our situation, his couriers have returned bearing a package that contained a vial stating that it was a cure for her illness. In desperation the doctors inserted the cure into Nova after which it appeared to everyone’s surprise that it didn’t work; however, the doctors did notice that the vial inhibited the illness’s ability to kill Nova, putting her in limbo. It would be some time before she could possibly recover if at all, so the Rangers had no choice but to ask RedEye’s government to help run the Ranger’s day-to-day affairs. This would inherently put a leash on the Rangers but what choice do they have when their leader is incapacitated?"
 fillysr_cr.15.a:0 "Let them have some influence..."

 fillysr_cr.16.d:0 "A week after we have sent an urgent message to RedEye, telling him of our situation, his couriers have returned bearing a package that contained a vial stating that it was a cure for her illness. Before the doctors could inject Nova with the supposed cure, we discovered that it was actually a liquefied mixture of cyanide pills and green food dye. Injecting Nova with this mixture could’ve killed her in seconds. It was an outright betrayal from RedEye and nothing short of an act of war. It appears that we have no other choice than to rally our troops and, if there really existed a cure like RedEye claimed, take it by force."
 fillysr_cr.16.a:0 "This means War!"

 fillysr_cr.17.d:0 "A week after we have sent an urgent message to RedEye, telling him of our situation, his couriers have returned bearing a package that contained a vial stating that it was a cure for her illness. The doctors had carefully examined the vial and its contents and discovered that it was something real and had decided to reverse engineer it and record any data they could find about it. In preparation if the illness pops up again. Moments later the cure was injected into Nova and within moments she awoke to cheers from doctors and Rangers alike. The cure worked, and Nova is alive and healthy. Certainly one day we can express our gratitude to our friends in RedEye’s nation. "
 fillysr_cr.17.a:0 "We knew we could count on them!"
 
 fillysr_cr.18.t:0 "Searching for a Cure"
 fillysr_cr.18.d:0 "It is highly unlikely that a nation of slavers and raiders would have the sophistications to develop a cure to a disease unknown to us, so the Scribes and a slew of medical personnel were ordered to identify the disease if they were to find a cure. Various medical experiments were performed on Nova and it was determined that it was a unknown neurological disease, simply put Nova’s brain is being ravaged by this illness, and if not remedied soon enough Nova could have permanent brain damage, or worse. The team tasked with finding a cure picked up the pace greatly and searched high and low for prewar medical records to see what could be done. Time is running out, and some are considering it would be faster to approach RedEye about this, still, some are reluctant. "
 fillysr_cr.18.a:0 "There must be something!"
 fillysr_cr.18.b:0 "Maybe RedEye can help after all?"
 
 fillysr_cr.19.t:0 "A dangerous Cure"
 fillysr_cr.19.d:0 "One folder tucked away in the Stable-Tech Mainframe held 6 medical related files that offered what could be the key to finding the cure, but much to the surprise of the team’s superiors, the team had faces of mild trauma after investigating the contents of that folder. They assured that they have what they needed and will have the cure ready within a week. A week passed and sure enough a vial was produced and administered to Nova, she made an easy recovery much to the relief and surprise of everyone. The team though, still looked heavily disturbed and when asked they refused to answer. More interestingly the folder and its files that they used to help make the cure have gone missing, and could either been hidden by the team or erased forever. The important thing is that Nova is cured and all is well.\n Coincidentally 6 unicorns went missing during the week of the cure’s production, but no connection could be made, lots of ponies go missing in the wasteland..."
 fillysr_cr.19.a:0 "It worked!"
 
 fillysr_cr.20.t:0 "Steel Rangers propose integration"
 fillysr_cr.20.d:0 "It appears that the “cure” we’ve sent them has rendered Nova in a sort of permanent Coma. With the Ranger’s government without leadership and guidance, they have requested that the Fillydelphia Rangers territory would be integrated into ours. Essentially they are asking to be annexed in order to have some form of leadership and to keep their day-to-day operations. While the spoils of annexing them can greatly improve our nation, there’s the strain of detaining all the wastelanders who live there into slavery. Cementing control over this territory would not be easy, but the spoils are very encouraging. Inevitably, RedEye sends a response entailing... "
 fillysr_cr.20.a:0 "Bring them into the Fold"
 fillysr_cr.20.b:0 "We have no need of them"
 
 fillysr_cr.21.t:0 "Love and Politics"
 fillysr_cr.21.d:0 "Nova Rage has come up with what could be the most peculiar one she’s ever have; the practice of marriages being used for political gain dates back to even before the creation of Equestria, where nobles and royals of the splintered pony kingdoms would arrange marriages to gain allies among other reasons, often to the dismay of the bride and groom of said marriages. What this has to do with Nova’s idea is that in many ways she’s been admiring RedEye strength and dedication and because of this Nova has developed romantic feelings for him, so it dawns on her that she could propose to RedEye not just for the sake of a possible romantic relationship, but the more obvious bonus that it would create a permanent union between the countries these two ponies rule over. This marriage would be a clear gesture of unification between the two formal rivals a forever cement the two wasteland empires as one. Nova is comfortable with this proposal, and she’s confident that RedEye would agree to this given the ways she’s seen him act whenever they meet. The only remaining question who should lead this union?"
 fillysr_cr.21.a:0 "RedEye shall lead the Union"
 fillysr_cr.21.b:0 "Nova Rage will lead!"
 
 fillysr_cr.22.t:0 "A very unusual Proposal"
 fillysr_cr.22.d:0 "To say that RedEye was flattered is an understatement, Nova has asked him his hoof in marriage, but not only this, he was asked to lead the inevitable union that would form between the two empires from the said marriage. Admittedly RedEye had grown fond of Nova in their many meet-ups, but he has some doubts about the union that would form if he were to agree to this. The idea that he would lead the union meant he would also have responsibility over the Fillydelphia Rangers territory, which would be daunting to control. The rewards of this could make all that worthwhile, RedEye could very well have the love of his life, and have an even stronger empire than the one he’s currently ruling. This is a very life changing decision, which is a very difficult one, but RedEye eventually reaches a decision on weather to say “yes” to the proposal. "

 fillysr_cr.23.t:0 "A very unusual Proposal"
 fillysr_cr.23.d:0 "To say that RedEye was flattered is an understatement, Nova has asked him his hoof in marriage, the only catch was; if he were to agree, Nova would lead the union that would form between the two empires. Admittedly RedEye had grown fond of Nova in their many meet-ups, but the possibility that he and his empire would be ruled over is not a very good one.  Nova would have the reigns over his empire with its resources, technology, and populous; however, Nova has assured in her letter to him that RedEye’s slavers and slaves would go untouched, and that they would now have the extra protection of the power armor-clad soldiers. This, coupled with possibility of having the love of his life, makes it very tempting to step back and take a break from the admittedly daunting task of controlling such aggressive slavers and revolting slaves. There was also the possibility that if RedEye said no then Nova might not respond to kindly... This is a very life changing decision, which is a very difficult one, but RedEye eventually reaches a decision on weather to say “yes” to the proposal. "

This successful seizure of technology has given us more power and more advantages over our enemies. Our Elder Blueberry is confidant that with this technology we can not only keep it from reigning destruction over the wasteland, but that we could use this to help hold off our enemies and beat them back where we could safely seize the technology from their lands.

Blueberry has organized an expedition to reach into the base and retrieve these materials that can greatly make things easier for us. There are two problems with this expedition; one is that we can only take back one of these materials with us and two; it would be inevitable that the expedition would clash against the Ringers which can be problematic after the expedition.

Within this hub of industrial misery is a computer vault located within the former city hall that is home to 452 terabytes of files that the Rangers deemed that are of vital importance to our efforts in various forms of industry and technology. Paladin Gate Keeper and his team of 12 Rangers have been ordered by Elder Blueberry herself to conduct a covert expedition into The Pit to extract the files and return without getting the attention of the slavers. Approaching the city hall however The team was met with a great dilemma; next to the city hall was a convoy of trucks which had been discovered to hold mountains of technology that even some would seem to be unrecognizable to even the Scribes. What was even more troubling is that the technology is being unloaded by dozens of slaves who surprisingly is not being watched. They slaves noticed the group of Rangers and within moments they ran up to them and pleaded that the Rangers take the slaves to freedom. Gate Keeper was at an impasse. He could stick to the mission and seize the countless files of information that could hold untold secrets, seize the convoy of technology and possibly have a physical form of the very secrets within said files, or give the pleading slaves a taste of freedom and add them to the manpower pool that is so valuable to the re-enforcement of the Ranger’s armies should a conflict arise. Each have their own rewards and their own consequences, but time is of the essence of this mission and it wouldn’t be long before the slave’s masters show up from a possible drug party.

But their sacrifice was not in vain, as they succeeded in putting an end to one of the greatest evils the wasteland has ever known. \n In a fortunate turn of events for the Rangers, it was confirmed that Stern, RedEye’s second in command, was killed and vaporized by Ranger laser rifles in the Battle of Fillydelphia.

While they were dispersed quickly by Military police, the sheer amount of similar Reports was worrying. Many of the Former Slaves did not seem content with being freed from the yoke of RedEye and were demanding true self governance and elections. A ridiculous proposal of course, as Equestria had been a diarchy for time immemorial, and Strawberry would not let some uneducated workers destroy more than a thousand years of tradition. The next report she opened warned of a more direct problem: The unsustainabillity of their food-usage. The Scribes are predicting our current stores to run out within 3-5 months, unless a solution was found. This was serious, Strawberry quickly penned a letter ordering a commitee to be formed to find possible solutions to their food-problems.

 fillysr_sl.15.desc:0 "Strawberry Lemonade was speechless when she looked at the sheet. The sheer amount of Caps RedEye had ammassed was large enough to plunge the entire Eastcoast into runaway inflation, and make the currency more or less worthless. Luckily, his major vaults of Caps in both Fillydelphia and the Cathedral had been secured by the Rangers and was now securely kept below the Old Stabletec building. However, it was estimated that between 17% and 21% of his wealth has fallen into the hooves of Looters and opportunists, devaluing the currency significantly. On top of that, many of Fillydelphias factories were no longer running, since no one wants to work in them out of their own free will.

A small mountain of Messages had formed left of her desk, as they just kept coming in faster than she could deal with them. Notebook Scribble was glancing at every one of them to determine if they were urgent and worth the Elders time. As Strawberry took a sip of cold Sparkle-Cola, Notebook floated another message to her. This one with a big Orange stamp on it, marking it as a message of military importance. \"Great, more Slavers turned Raiders\" Strawberry said, defeated, but as she opened the message it revealed itself to be surprisingly short: \"§HLost Contact with Team at Cathedral.

The Everfree would probably kill more of our boys than the bullets of those fanatics.\" Strawberry nodded to that, the fanatical followers of RedEye, calling themselves \"Children of the Cathedral\" had chosen to even follow their master after his death and... Winchester interrupted her thoughts \" If we had this forest back when we were fighting against you Rangers, y'all wouldn't have held Filly for a Year.\" He added with a wink. Strawberry smiled at that, she wouldn't make the same mistake Blueberry Sabre made, fighting endlessly against a guerilla force.

It was a small procession of maybe 20 ponies, some knights, but most Scribes, that escorted Strawberry to the Cathedral. Ash swirled around their hooves with every step they took, the remains of a cursed Forest that still refuseed to die. A few hundred meters away, a squatt, blackened structure took up most of the view northwards, the Cathedral, former Capital of RedEye. Two days ago, Crossroads had declared the Area pacified. It seemed like the Fanatics had fought to the last, as no-one was captured, and only charred corpses remained. While its walls were bullet-ridden and some of its towers had collapsed, the Cathedral was still a mighty building, and could suit as a centre of Industry. But if it were left standing, its greatness would always glorify RedEye, never those who won. As if he read her thoughts, Notebook walked up beside her \"I think we should tear it down!

As the first ten were led in, the Crowd of slaves erupted in Cursing and threats. these were some of the most High-ranking Slavers that had Survived the War, foremost among them RedEyes pupil, Protegé.

Of course, there were those who were irredeamable. Ponies who had commited terrible acts for their own sadistic enjoyment, or only to enrich themselves. Strawberry had ordered the list this morning, intending to sign a summary Execution-order and have them dealt with. by now it was Mid-Day and she still couldn't bring herself to sign it. Those who were evil, those who wish to harm Equestria, they deserve to die, but how could she kill ponies that acted with genuinely good intentions, and were just hostage to the Situation?

She thought back about the stories her parents told her about the Windigoes and the unnatural cold they supposedly could produce, but then shook her head. They were not in a childrens book, this was real life, and they clearly had made the wrong decision. She silently hoped that at least someone would find their bodies one day, and return them home. With a soft buzzing, another heater gave up its flame, snuffed out by a Cold that would not cease until all of them were dead."

They could try to push on, and make it to the outpost even in the storm, but visibility was terrible, and there was no guarantee they would even walk in the right direction.

While her tears instantly froze on her fur, she knocked at the door, before collapsing near it. As the door opened, and the first of them started moving in, one of the knights picked her up and carried her inside. A wave of warmth washed over her, and she could feel the fingers of death loosing their grasp on her. And while it felt oh, so wonderful to be inside, it also made her realize how tired she truly was, and how only survival had pushed her forward for these last few hours. \"We... we made it\" she softly said, before her eyes fell shut from exhaustion. The next morning, she would find out, that two of their expedition never reached the outpost, and were most likely dead in the mountains. 12 of them had frotbite and would need to be treated, but nopony was in mortal danger anymore. And while she cried for those who were lost, she said a silent prayer to Celestia and Luna, thanking them for at least saving the rest."

Even after over 200 years, its air-seals showed no signs of deterioration, still looking brand new. As the professor moved through the Outpost, she saw the ponies of her Expetidion interacting with the resident dogs that had made the outpost their home. Some seemed tense, but most were friendly with eachother. Not that either side could affort conflict in such a dangerous area. She turned to head towards the archives, when she spotted an old gray dog, sitting at a fire, apparently telling a story to some younger dogs, as well as some of her scribes."

When Cabbage touched the console, the screen flickered to life. displaying thousands upon thousands of automated weather reports for the last 200+ years. Curious of what the report would be, Cabbage scrolled back to the Report from the Day the bombs dropped, and the old world ended. Clear skies for the most part, but an unscheduled Cloudy overcast later in the day. That must have been when the Pegasi closed up the sky for good, dammned traitors. As she looked through the rest of the Data for the day, one point caught her eye: \" Impact of Megaspell-capable Missile detected 4 Kilometers west, no explosion recorded\" An unexploded missile, maybe even recoverable..."

Ahh, yes the day of green Fire, when Gods died and the sun went away, never to be seen again. Our ancestors have told many stories about said day: Great heroes who tried and failed to stop the destruction, the Sacrifice of Luna, the great Blood-Comet in the sky that nearly hit this very mountain, the...\" Cabbage perked up at thet \" The Great blood comet?\" The old dog smiled \" Yes, a great bloodred comet streaked low through the skies, almost hitting this very mountain and ending it. They say it crashed 1 more peak westward\" Cabbage was speechless. It couldn't be... A Megaspell-Missile from the Zebras? And it sounded like it crashed nearby without exploding..."

 fillysr_sl.65.d:0 "The ominously named \"Bloodstone Valley\" was where they had pinpointed the missile impact to. Now the Expedition and some of the dogs from Crystallia had made a short excursion there, since it was only a couple hours from the outpost, and the weather had cleared up again. Even through her snow-glasses the Valey was blindingly white, and she Started to fear that the Storm a few days prior may have burrie dthe missile for goo, if it hadn't been in the first place. But, she had an idea: Since this missile was most likely carrying a balefire Megaspell, it would give off a good amount of magical radiation, and could be found that way. Not 2 hours into searching, one of their instruments picked up unusually high radiation, and so they began to dig through the snow."

 fillysr_sl.66.d:0 "It was a thing of savage beauty, this missile from the Zebra Empire. Well, missile was not the right word, as this one had already thrown off its boosters and only the Warhead itself remained. Still, it was as large as a Truck and bearing the most dangerous cargo in the world. Cabbage took a couple extra RadSafe before approaching it. She admired the precise construction for a moments, before going to work, levering open the manual emergency panel. All megaspells had these, you wouldn't want to built a bomb with no way of shutting it off in case of emergency after all. The tiny screen only displayd a few numbers, but from what cabbage could make out, the Spellchamber was damaged and could not be turned off or reused, but the Spellcore was still fully intact. Without the Spellchamber, they would essentially get an empty spell core, but those could still be immensly useful for other purposes. However, Something was bothering the professor: The Missile clearly hadn't crahsed, it just failed to explode. There was no reason to hit a weather station, and Canterlot was too far away for the missile to be aimed at the Capital... Maybe it was aimed at this very spot?\n Maybe there was something below these 200 years of ice...\n The only way to find out would be to set the Megaspell to detonate in a few days, get to the safety of the Outpost, and then return to see what it had laid free."

The Levels of magical Radiation spiked for some minutes, before the primary radiation started to fade. The Secondary radiation would persist for centureies, but since it did not reach to the Outpost, no lasting harm was done. Donning one of the few Rad-Suits the Outpost had in storage, Cabbage and a few members of the Expedition in similar suits, or insulated Power armor, made theri way to the origin of the exploion. Where Yesterday there had layed a warhead in a snowy valley, there now was a snow-free valleay of scorched rock, as the Balefire had melted the Ice and the folloving Avalanches too. What caught her Eye however, was a large metal door, similar to the Stable-doors at Headquaters. It was warped in its holdings, but clearly had been enought to take the brunt of the blast, after it had used up its energy in vaporizing the snow. This was it! A hidden Base, deep in the mountains.

Apparently, the Government had discretely cloned the Best soldiers that had fallen during the war, in order to one day mass-produce them. The mass-production had failed, and ony a few clones of each individual were made successfully. They were currently being kept in suspended animation, just waiting for orders to be given, and activation codeas to be sent.

Another funnel fed it fresh water from an underground reservoir, ensuring the Sun had enough mass to continue the reaction that made it work. A device that produced as much energy as an entire Powerplant, small enough to put one into every neighborhood and only needing water as fuel.

After she moved to a safe distance, the knight opened fire with his saddle-mounted machine gun: Before a bullet hit the target, the talisman began to glow. A bright blue shield sprang up around the target, enveloping it in a bubble. The shield seemed to be made up of Hexagons and pentagons, forming an almost perfect shpere arount the talisman and the target. The first few bullets sent tiny, rippling waves through the shield where they hit, but once they touched the shield, they lost all their momentum and harmlessly fell to the ground. A second of full auto later, the shield collapsed, and the target was ripped apart by a storm of munitions. Equestria had used this secret base to try and copy Zebra talisman-technology. While they had only limited success, they were able to invent a version of a Shield Talisman, that could be mass-produced at a reasonable price, as long as one had a large amount of magical Crystals..."

They continued on through the winding streets, past the opulent homes of the former Garden districts to the more modest abodes in the lower district, the procession continued onward, accompanied by the ever present beat of the eight military snare drums that trailed behind it.\n The procession itself was an awe inspiring sight, the hulking silver clad forms of the Ranger’s greatest warriors, shepherded along by robe clad ponies that composed the Order of the Quill. However, these auspicious figures were not what drew the attention of the masses. It was not the shining armor, the famed soldiers, or the brightest minds left in the Wastes that drew the crowds that solemnly lined the streets.\n It was the coffin they held above them, the sarcophagus they so reverently conveyed through the streets of Canterlot. The casket itself was a relatively simple construct for all the attention it demanded, the charcoal black box’s only true indication of importance being the silver half moon emblazoned upon its side to indicate the individual interred within.

The march finally concluded as they passed through Ministry Row, finally conveying the mortal form of their ruler back to her rightful place, the Palace.\n Strawberry was a paragon of neutrality as the coffin approached the former throne of the Lunar Diarch, an opening having been carved out of the marble at its base in preparation for this moment. With a nod from Notebook Scribble, the scribes that had accompanied the procession finally stepped in to play their role, igniting their horns simultaneously to lift the sarcophagus off the backs of their brethren, guiding it through the air to suspend it above the grave made within the floor. The Paladins stepped back, taking up the position of a ceremonial guard around the grave itself.\n With a single decisive nod from Strawberry, the coffin was slowly lowered into the ground, the faded marble floor providing a striking contrast to the black coffin descending into it. Finally, it reached the bottom of the grave, the scribes releasing their magical grip and stepping back, their work completed. Notebook took a moment to stare down into the grave before lowering his head, his horn glowing once more as the hole began to heal, the marble creeping over the sarcophagus interred below.\n Inscribed on this patch of marble was a simple commemoration\n“Here lies our eternal Goddess of the Night, Princes Luna. May she guide our actions from above.”\nHe finally looked up, meeting Strawberry’s eyes for a moment before breaking the silence.\n\n“Long live the Regent.”"
