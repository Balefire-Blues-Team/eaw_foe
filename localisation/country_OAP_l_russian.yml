### Opening Focuses ###

 OAP_opening_1:0 "Под палящим солнцем"
 OAP_opening_1_desc:0 "Регион пустоши, в котором мы живём, отличается от остальной её части. Под этим палящим солнцем смогли выжить лишь наши предки. Их сформировала эта земля, а они, в свою очередь, сформировали эту землю."
 
 OAP_opening_2:0 "В земле песка и прибыли"
 OAP_opening_2_desc:0 "Там, где глупцы видят негостеприимную пустыню, мы видим оазис возможностей, чьи пески предлагают просто безграничную прибыль тем, кто осмелится ступить в эти земли."
 
 OAP_opening_3:0 "Предложение, от которого мы не смогли отказаться"
 OAP_opening_3_desc:0 "Немногие рассматривали наш регион как место, подходящее для инвестиций. Но один харизматичный жеребец пустоши обратил свой взор на нашу нацию..."
 
 OAP_economic_reshuffle:0 "Экономические перестановки"
 OAP_economic_reshuffle_desc:0 "Наша экономика слаба как никогда. Если мы хотим преуспеть или, хотя бы, измениться, мы должны направить нашу экономику в новое русло. Но в какое?"
 
 OAP_investements_from_RED:0 "Инвестиции из Филлидельфии"
 OAP_investements_from_RED_desc:0 "К счастью, наши связи с Филлидельфией и тамошними работорговцами могут дать нам тот толчок, в котором столь отчаянно нуждается наша экономика. Пусть даже некоторым другим не нравится идея искать инвестиции в других нациях."
 
 OAP_import_heavy_industry:0 "Импортировать тяжёлое оборудование"
 OAP_import_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Нам бы очень пригодилось тяжёлое промышленное оборудование. И хоть у Новой Эпплузы нет такой техники, мы всегда можем обратиться к Филлидельфии, которая будет рада нам помочь."
 
 OAP_homegrown_industry:0 "Сфокусироваться на гражданской промышленности"
 OAP_homegrown_industry_desc:0 "Инвестиции в нашу собственную экономику могут быть весьма прибыльными, если мы будем действовать разумно. Наш гражданский сектор является довольно безопасным вариантом, даже если это означает перепрофилирование старых заводов военного времени на более современные и универсальные."
 
 OAP_subsidize_merchants:0 "Субсидировать местных торговцев"
 OAP_subsidize_merchants_desc:0 "Один из верных способов увеличить поток крышек - просто инвестировать в наших местных купцов и торговцев оружием. Субсидирование укрепит нашу гражданскую промышленность, обеспечив при этом стабильность нашего политического влияния."
 
 OAP_farming_desert:0 "Фермы кактусов в пустыне"
 OAP_farming_desert_desc:0 "Конечно, укрепление всех секторов экономики включает в себя и поиск любых возможностей на наших собственных землях. Будет разумно воспользоваться почти бесконечными просторами наших пустынь и основать там фермы кактусов."
 
 OAP_fillydelphian_model:0 "Филлидельфийская модель"
 OAP_fillydelphian_model_desc:0 "Хотя многие считают её жестокой, филлидельфийская экономическая модель крайне эффективна. И хоть во время войны сосредоточение большинства рабов в тяжёлой промышленности может быть опасно, так как эти фабрики могут быть захвачены, в мирное время наш промышленный рост взлетит до небес!"
 
 OAP_like_old_times:0 "Как в старые добрые времена"
 OAP_like_old_times_desc:0 "Тяжелая промышленность хороша и прекрасна, но уже почти ставший мифом образ жизни микси требует более сельского подхода к рабству. Богатые купцы и владельцы плантаций напрямую контролируют своих рабов и используют их для обработки земли или добычи необходимых нам ресурсов. Мы должны вернуться к этим старым ценностям, а не перенимать идеи Красного Глаза."
 
 OAP_currency_control_issue:0 "Отсрочить инфляцию"
 OAP_currency_control_issue_desc:0 "Сейчас наши крышки ценятся не дороже песка под нашими копытами. Хотя борьба с инфляцией - это весьма долгосрочный процесс, осуществление немедленных мер определенно может замедлить ухудшение ситуации."
 
 OAP_fasttrack_reform:0 "Ускорить развитие промышленности"
 OAP_fasttrack_reform_desc:0 "Нам нужно как можно скорее стать индустриальной нацией!\nМногие в нашей стране не одобрят такую угрозу своему прежнему образу жизни, и рейнджеры, несомненно, воспользуются этим как предлогом для вербовки новых рекрутов. Но это наш лучший вариант."
 
 OAP_charmings_proposal:0 "Предложение Чармин Лака"
 OAP_charmings_proposal_desc:0 "Как интересно... мне передали письмо от Чармин Лака. И чего же он хочет?"
 
 OAP_bandaid_braindrain:0 "Залатать утечку мозгов"
 OAP_bandaid_braindrain_desc:0 "Наша технологическая грамотность просто ужасна, и если ничего не сделать, чтобы исправить её вовремя, то даже самые умные пони не смогут спасти Эпплузу от наступления очередного тёмного века. Мы должны реформировать наши методы исследования и внедрить надлежащие научные процедуры."
 
 OAP_safe_reforms:0 "Безопасные реформы"
 OAP_safe_reforms_desc:0 "Хотя нам крайне нужны перемены, чтобы вытащить нашу экономику из ямы с песком, небезопасные и экстремальные изменения лишь навредят ей ещё сильнее. Реализация более безопасных реформ позволит нам медленно восстановиться и убедиться, что мы не сломаем своих копыт в процессе."
 
 OAP_ask_RED_help:0 "Запросить помощь у Филлидельфии"
 OAP_ask_RED_help_desc:0 "Мы уже видели, как сотрудничество с Филлидельфией творило просто чудеса в сфере развития нашей промышленности. Запрос дополнительной помощи только сильнее ускорит этот процесс!"
 
 OAP_learn_from_azuria:0 "Уроки Азурии"
 OAP_learn_from_azuria_desc:0 "Разбитое Копыто сумело противостоять влиянию Красного Глаза, несмотря на все его усилия, и другие народы того региона, похоже, действуют также. Мы должны взять их в качестве примера и попытаться снизить влияние Филлидельфии и на нашу собственную страну."
 
 OAP_deal_with_farsight:0 "Разобраться с Фарсайтом"
 OAP_deal_with_farsight_desc:0 "Фарсайт слишком долго причинял нам неприятности. Пришло самое время что-то сделать с этим беспокойным рейнджером..."
 
 OAP_most_loyal_servant:0 "Его вернейший слуга"
 OAP_most_loyal_servant_desc:0 "[RED.GetLeader] и его работорговцы уже доказали, что де-факто являются первой экономикой пустошей. Их мастерство в поддержании функционирования такой большой империи работорговцев неоспоримо, так что для Эпплузы имеет смысл последовать за ними."
 
 OAP_return_to_tradition:0 "Возвращение к традициям"
 OAP_return_to_tradition_desc:0 "Слишком много времени Эпплуза провела в оковах. Слишком долго она выжимала всю кровь и соки со своих бесчисленных рабов, что трудились над бессмысленным будущим, которое награждает лишь самых безумных. Наконец-то у нас появилась возможность возродить наши традиции!"
 
 OAP_appleloosan_army:0 "Новые силы обороны Эпплузы"
 OAP_appleloosan_army_desc:0 "Будет сформирована совершенно новая армия, состоящая только из опалённых солнцем пони, что называют домом эти пустыни. Только самые лучшие будут защищать пески Эпплузы."
 
 OAP_ranger_army:0 "Пусть рейнджеры сохранят свои позиции"
 OAP_ranger_army_desc:0 "Пусть рейнджеры и постоянно доказывали, что являются помехой для нас, но никак нельзя отрицать их боевую доблесть и непревзойденные умения войны в пустынях. Вероятно, будет лучше, если мы оставим их в покое..."
 
 OAP_doctrinal_thought:0 "Развитие доктрин"
 OAP_doctrinal_thought_desc:0 "Развитие военной мысли включает в себя и создание правильной доктрины. Наши генералы должны понять, как правильно следует внедрять инновации."
 
 OAP_expand_spec_ops:0 "Программа спецназа"
 OAP_expand_spec_ops_desc:0 "Хотя мы привыкли тренироваться в пустынях, совершенно ясно, что у более крупных держав всегда будет больше войск. Небольшие и специализированные в определённых областях элитные подразделения помогут нам отразить любую угрозу."
 
 OAP_buy_big_guns:0 "Купить чертежи оружия"
 OAP_buy_big_guns_desc:0 "Если мы хотим сосредоточиться на качестве, то нам потребуется модернизировать наше оружие, а для этого необходимы собственные чертежи. Стоит приобрести их побыстрее."
 
 OAP_train_up_masses:0 "Подготовить массы"
 OAP_train_up_masses_desc:0 "Хотя в пределах наших границ проживает не так уж много пони, многие всё же жаждут сражаться за Эпплузу. Нам нужно лишь начать кампанию по вербовке, чтобы укрепить наши ряды."
 
 OAP_buy_many_guns:0 "Оптовые закупки оружия"
 OAP_buy_many_guns_desc:0 "Солдат просто бесполезен без собственного оружия. Почему бы не использовать наши крышки и не закупить побольше оружия для наших верных солдат?"

 
### Steel Shackles Tree ###
 
 OAP_power_cemented:0 "Власть вновь подтверждена"
 OAP_power_cemented_desc:0 "Теперь, когда мой контроль над Старой Эпплузой был вновь подтвержден, пришло время провести радикальные перемены в стране. На данный момент стоит заняться обеспечением стабильности притока рабов с юго-запада."
 
 OAP_southwest_trade:0 "Новые торговые сделки с юго-западом"
 OAP_southwest_trade_desc:0 "У держав юго-запада есть пони, а у нас - зерно и товарные культуры. Мы заключим новые торговые сделки, согласно которым юго-запад будет стабильно поставлять нам рабов и одновременно зависеть от нас в поставках продовольствия. Это просто беспроигрышный вариант!"
 
 OAP_seize_slaves:0 "Захватить рабов соперников"
 OAP_seize_slaves_desc:0 "Мелкие дворяне старой Эпплузы впустую проживают свои упадочные жизни на плантациях. А ещё они используют своих рабов, чтобы те трудились на полях, когда их труд может превратить этот ветхий город в крупную державу! Но теперь Чармин Лак не стоит у меня на пути, и никто не помешает мне подчинить себе этих гадких аристократов. Пришло время захватить рабов плантаторов и передать их себе... э-э, то есть государству в качестве запаса рабочей силы."
 
 OAP_increase_imports:0 "Увеличить импорт ресурсов"
 OAP_increase_imports_desc:0 "Превращение Старой Эпплузы в крупную державу невозможно без индустриализации. Но индустриализация требует множество металла и прочих ресурсов, которые мы не можем производить сами. Нам придётся потратить немало крышек, но эти инвестиции окупятся достаточно скоро."
 
 OAP_slaves_research:0 "Рабы-исследователи"
 OAP_slaves_research_desc:0 "Многие из моих новоприобретенных рабов ярки и полны потенциала. Потенциала, который дворяне Эпплузы тратили впустую, заставляя их изо дня в день работать на полях. Эти рабы принесут намного больше пользы, помогая нашим ученым в их исследованиях. И да, им, как и стажёрам, не нужно ничего платить."
 
 OAP_slaves_factory:0 "Промышленное рабство"
 OAP_slaves_factory_desc:0 "Пока остальные дворяне используют своих рабов для обработки земли, государство намерено индустриализироваться с помощью рабов, захваченных у моих политических противников."
 
 OAP_stop_braindrain:0 "Остановить утечку мозгов"
 OAP_stop_braindrain_desc:0 "Лучшие умы Эпплузы наконец-то решили остаться дома. И всё благодаря нашей новой системе образования и доступу к дешёвым научным помощникам. Через некоторое время эта правильная политика окончательно решит проблему утечки мозгов."
 
 OAP_meet_red:0 "Встретиться с [RED.GetLeader]"
 OAP_meet_red_desc:0 "Новая сила, что укрепилась в руинах Филлидельфии, быстро стала одной из сильнейших наций в пустоши. Эта армия работорговцев, рейдеров и когтей, основанная Красным Глазом, сумела укрепить свои позиции. Они уже были нашими ценными торговыми партнерами в течение некоторого времени, но теперь пришло время лично встретиться с [RED.GetLeader], чтобы обсудить наше будущее."
 
 OAP_research_cathedral:0 "Исследователи Собора"
 OAP_research_cathedral_desc:0 "Сотрудничество с Красным Глазом было одним из лучших моих решений! Этот простак теперь отправляет нам своих исследователей и технологии из Собора!"
 
 OAP_slaver_exchange_program:0 "Программа обмена работорговцами"
 OAP_slaver_exchange_program_desc:0 "В рамках моей встречи с Красным Глазом он попросил создать "Программу обмена работорговцами". С её помощью работорговцы обеих наших стран расширят свои области знаний и смогут перенять методы друг друга. Хотя я ставлю под сомнение эту логику и подозреваю в этом попытку шпионажа, в данный момент у нас нет особого выбора."
 
 OAP_ask_NAP:0 "Попросить Новую Эпплузу"
 OAP_ask_NAP_desc:0 "Наш город-побратим на северо-востоке попал под влияние Красного Глаза! Если я предложу Красному Глазу расширение сотрудничества и подчинения, то он предоставит нам контроль над этой территорией... наверное."
 
 OAP_united_NAP:0 "Наконец-то едины"
 OAP_united_NAP_desc:0 "Благодаря великодушию Красного Глаза Старая и Новая Эпплузы наконец-то объединились под одним знаменем. Моим знаменем! Эпплузцев больше не будут разделять мелочные идеи вроде "дистанции", "самоуправления" или "неправильности рабства". Пришло время основать единую Великую Эпплузу!"
 
 OAP_sister_NAP:0 "Сотрудничество между братскими нациями"
 OAP_sister_NAP_desc:0 "Вот же гадство! Красный Глаз отклонил моё чрезмерно щедрое предложение об объединении Старой и Новой Эпплуз. Но, как бы то ни было, эти нации и так были разделены веками. Сотрудничество с братским народом будет достаточно хорошим уже само по себе, и они послужат отличным торговым центром для наших товаров."
 
 OAP_couple_eco:0 "Воспользоваться связями с Красным Глазом"
 OAP_couple_eco_desc:0 "Старая Эпплуза уже несколько месяцев верно служит Красному Глазу. Кстати, я лично несколько раз сообщал ему о наших успехах, и он в восторге! Честно говоря, я бы осмелился заявить, что являюсь хорошим другом Красного Глаза. Я уверен, что он отнесётся с пониманием к предложению предоставить Старой Эпплузе чуть большую автономию и расширить промышленную помощь."
 
 OAP_payouts_to_supporters:0 "Выплаты близким сторонникам"
 OAP_payouts_to_supporters_desc:0 "Хотя большинство дворян Старой Эпплузы поддерживают Чармин Лака, у меня есть ряд сторонников среди среднего класса. Мелкие владельцы плантаций, свободные ремесленники и йомены, а также интеллектуалы, которые решили остаться здесь. Если я собираюсь оставаться у власти ещё какое-то время, то им нужно будет раздать кое-какие взятки. Так мои сторонники хоть как-то сравняются с аристократами."

 OAP_arrest_charming:0 "Арестовать Чармин Лака"
 OAP_arrest_charming_desc:0 "Несмотря на все мои усилия, Чармин Лак продолжает доставлять мне неприятности. Большинство дворян по-прежнему поддерживают его и не одобряют мои реформы, несмотря на его попытки спровоцировать рабов на бунт... Ну, точнее так будет написано в официальных отчётах, когда его посадят за решётку! Это покажет этим напыщенным придуркам, что происходит с теми, кто встаёт у меня на пути!"

 OAP_stabilize:0 "Стабилизировать страну"
 OAP_stabilize_desc:0 "Чармин Лак гниёт в тюрьме, а карманы моих сторонников набиты крышками. Дворяне могут скулить и стенать сколько угодно, но сейчас они мало что могут сделать. Расколы Старой Эпплузы никуда не исчезли, но я успешно выиграл борьбу за власть и начал возвращать стабильность."
 
 OAP_reorganize_industry:0 "Реорганизовать нашу промышленность"
 OAP_reorganize_industry_desc:0 "Промышленному сектору Старой Эпплузы не хватает гибкости, присущей настоящей индустриальной державе. Вся система - от цепочки поставок до завода - остро нуждается в скорейшей реорганизации. Первым делом мы должны централизовать производство в городах и рационализировать его, чтобы заводы могли производить более одного вида товаров."
 
 OAP_urbanize_pops:0 "Урбанизация населения"
 OAP_urbanize_pops_desc:0 "Старая Эпплуза исторически была аграрной нацией из-за политического господства класса плантаторов. Однако большинство моих сторонников родом из города Старая Эпплуза. Благодаря моим прежним промышленным реформам население уже начало переселяться в этот город. Однако лишь одной метрополии недостаточно, чтобы обезопасить мою власть, равно как и империю. Мы должны начать превращать сельские общины в самостоятельные городские центры."
 
 OAP_smelting_iron:0 "Комплекс добычи железистых песков"
 OAP_smelting_iron_desc:0 "В пустыне близ Эпплузы есть немалые запасы железистого песка. Хотя большинство считают бесполезным эти ресурсы, я вижу в них немалый потенциал. Мы создадим добывающий комплекс для переработки залежей железистого песка в сталь и тем самым восполним нехватку полезных ископаемых."
 
 OAP_purify_water:0 "Очистить речную воду"
 OAP_purify_water_desc:0 "Радиация от жар-бомб и многолетний слив сточных вод сделали реки, протекающие через Эпплузу, токсичными, значительно ограничив запасы воды и продовольствия. К счастью, знания земных пони Красного Глаза и магия единорогов поможет нам начать долгий и трудный процесс очистки наших источников воды."
 
 OAP_gateway:0 "Врата в Новую Эпплузу"
 OAP_gateway_desc:0 "Если мы планируем воплотить мечту о Великой Эпплузе в реальности, мы должны обезопасить эти земли! И сейчас перед нами стоит лишь жалкая и безнадежная банда мусорщиков. Слава Старой Эпплузы близка к возвращению, так что В БОЙ!"
 
 OAP_expand_rails:0 "Расширить железные дороги"
 OAP_expand_rails_desc:0 "Железные дороги всегда были источником жизненной силы Старой Эпплузы с момента её основания до сегодняшнего дня. Они соединяли нас с нашим городом-побратимом и остальным миром. По мере расширения Эпплузы должна расширяться и наша железнодорожная сеть. Хотя бы для обеспечения будущего расширения."
 
 OAP_tradepost_cloudsdale:0 "Дорога до Клаудсдейла"
 OAP_tradepost_cloudsdale_desc:0 "Теперь мы можем соединить железными дорогами наши недавно захваченные земли с остальной частью нашей страны... Первым делом мы постараемся соединить две Эпплузы с Клаудсдейлом."
 
 OAP_integrate_LIT:0 "Интегрировать наши новые земли"
 OAP_integrate_LIT_desc:0 "Собиратели Молний побеждены. Их лидеры либо мертвы, либо же пропали без вести, а сопротивление рассеяно и уже частично порабощено. Выжившие и те, кто готов поклясться мне в верности, должны быть вознаграждены и смогут стать частью нации Великая Эпплуза!"
 
 OAP_final_confron:0 "Prepare for the Final Confrontation"
 OAP_final_confron_desc:0 "If I’m going to become the undisputed master of the wasteland a war with Red Eye is inevitable, and in order to break his empire I will need one of my own. I may have united Grand Appleloosa but it is just a singular nation. Prepare the troops, at dawn we conquer Azuria!"
 
 OAP_hold_line:0 "Hold the Line"
 OAP_hold_line_desc:0 "The Shattered Hoof Raiders are a fierce enemy and they outnumber our own forces. Our best chance at success is to hunker down along a defensive position, build trenches, and pick off their waves as they come. They cannot replace their losses forever, and once their forces are depleted we can once again go on the offensive."
 
 OAP_push_azure:0 "Push Across the Azureway"
 OAP_push_azure_desc:0 "We may be outnumbered, but Shattered Hoof Raider’s are undisciplined. By concentrating our forces we can shatter their forces and push through them and across the Azureway! Once we’ve secured the Shattered Hoof Re-Education Facility their disorganized forces will surely collapse."
 
 OAP_call_reserve:0 "Call up Reserves"
 OAP_call_reserve_desc:0 "The war for Azuria is wrapping up, but in order to seal our victory we’re going to need more forces in the field. Call up our reserve troops and get them to the frontline."
 
 OAP_cpacify_locals:0 "Pacify the Locals"
 OAP_cpacify_locals_desc:0 "The locals of Azuria are a rowdy and violent bunch. By handing power to "agreeable" raiders in exchange for "retiring" their old bosses we can ensure the violent and rowdy ponies are only violent and rowdy for us!"
 
 OAP_our_reward:0 "Our Due Reward"
 OAP_our_reward_desc:0 "I have been a loyal servant to Red Eye since we first met, and now we have pacified Azuria for him. It is high time that we were rewarded for our service! Nothing less than the complete administration of Azuria will do!"
 
 OAP_loyalty:0 "A Question of Loyalty"
 OAP_loyalty_desc:0 "Holy shit he accepted my demands... I was certain he would deny me and start a war. Maybe we can still work with him? Then again... it would be a lot more fun to replace him. Hmmm decisions, decisions..."
 
 OAP_war_for_heartlands:0 "The Final War"
 OAP_war_for_heartlands_desc:0 "Finally, the Time has come.\nWith my nation as strong as never before, we can stand up against Red Eye, and drag him down from his throne!\nI, Steel Shackles, shall take his place as the Master of Grand Appleloosa, Azuria, and Fillydelphia!"
 
 OAP_azurian_legions:0 "The Azurian Legions"
 OAP_azurian_legions_desc:0 "Our war with the Shattered Hoof Raiders demonstrated the Azurian ponies' proficiency for war. We have already employed a number of them to pacify their own country, so it only makes sense to unify these motley militias into a professional army; the Azurian Legions!"
 
 OAP_get_gunds:0 "Corner the Black Market"
 OAP_get_gunds_desc:0 "We will spend a nice chunk of our considerable wealth, to buy up some of the most High-tech weapons from across the Wasteland."
 
 OAP_nationalize_all_gun_workshops:0 "Nationalize all Gun-Workshops"
 OAP_nationalize_all_gun_workshops_desc:0 "In order to defeat Red Eye we’re going to need to be able to compete with his own military production. We cannot be held back by private interests and  profits driving the price higher than the cost of production."
 
 OAP_incite_uprisings:0 "Incite Slave-Uprisings"
 OAP_incite_uprisings_desc:0 "Red Eye’s slaver-exchanges have been a double bladed sword it appears. Whether he intended to use the slavers sent to us as spies or not, I had that idea myself at least, and our slavers learned some juicy information. Red Eye’s slave empire is far more Brutal than ours, and I see no reason to not use that to our advantage. Promises of peace and freedom... or at the least more comfy work conditions could sway some of Red Eye’s slaves into rebellion."
 
 OAP_plantation_army:0 "Press Plantation-Slaves into the Army"
 OAP_plantation_army_desc:0 "The planter class has always stood in the way of my ambition, and in the way of Grand Appleloosia’s rise. Their decadency finally ends now, we can no longer afford to maintain their lavish and hedonistic lifestyles. As a final blow to those perfidious planters, their slaves will be pressed into the army. They will be far more useful there than growing more cash crops and lining the pockets of the greedy geriatric gentry."

 OAP_red_schools:0 "Implement Red Eye's Schooling System"
 OAP_red_schools_desc:0 "Red Eye has implemented a robust system of education throughout his empire, one of the many reasons I’m sure he has achieved so much success. An educated populus would bring many advantages to Appleloosa  of our own... although it could also act as a very efficient propaganda tool as well."
 
 OAP_red_victory:0 "Victory in the Final War!"
 OAP_red_victory_desc:0 "It was a hard fought and brutal war, but through grit, determination, countless reforms and structural changes, and (fourth funny minor thing), we have come out victorious! From Fillydelphia to Old Appleloosa, I reign as the sole ruler of the wasteland! Long live our glorious leader; Emperor and Master Steel Shackles"
 
 OAP_hunt_dissidents_monsters:0 "Hunt Dissidents and Monsters"
 OAP_hunt_dissidents_monsters_desc:0 "What do you mean that they misunderstood what I said? How could anyone confuse "Hey let’s make it a yearly tradition to hunt dissidents and monsters" for killing alicorns? Those are not even a factor here... I see, ok yea that makes sense, Alicorns are pretty monstrous. Fine, I'll change the name to the Servile Hunt. How does that sound? Gets the point across, ok, now let's round up some of those slaves, ideally the most feisty. We’re going to hunt the most dangerous game... ponies."
 
 OAP_bribe_generals:0 "Government Positions for the Family"
 OAP_bribe_generals_desc:0 "The old government was full of my enemies and pawns of the planters. Luckily now that I’ve taken power the old government doesn't matter anymore, and I can appoint anyone I want! We could  finally do away with the cronyism and nepotism in Old Appleloosa... or I could just give power to my family, I mean they are my greatest supporters and agree with my positions after all."
 
 OAP_hire_talons:0 "Hire our own Talons"
 OAP_hire_talons_desc:0 "The Talon Griffon mercenary company has served the highest bidder for centuries. All across the wasteland Talons serve their employers well. Griselda is a recent upstart within the company looking for a patron. Her forces will serve Appleloosa well."
 
 OAP_invite_fillydelphian_advisors:0 "New Slave Soldiers"
 OAP_invite_fillydelphian_advisors_desc:0 "Some say that slaves make terrible Soldiers, but those ponies simply don't know how to properly break a slave!\nMonths of brutal training and indoctrination may kill 3/4 Slaves we train, but the survivors will be good and mindless soldiers."
 
 OAP_anti_machine_weapons:0 "Anti-Machine Weaponry"
 OAP_anti_machine_weapons_desc:0 "Vehicles are rare in the wasteland, Power Armor less so but are mostly in the hooves of the steel rangers. Still, as these machines become more common on the battlefield we will need weapons that can defeat them. Anti-Machine Weaponry if you will."
 
 OAP_mass_drills:0 "Massed Combat Drills"
 OAP_mass_drills_desc:0 "If we want our slave army to be successful they’re going to have to learn to fight. While Griselda and her Talons are at home they can be put to use training our slave army for mass combat."
 
 OAP_serve_either_way:0 "An Army of Slaves and Masters"
 OAP_serve_either_way_desc:0 "With our slaves trained for mass combat, our army reforms are starting to wrap up. From now on our army will consist of more than just aristocratic officers and poor free-pony soldiers. From now on Slaves and Masters will serve together! With the slaves serving as the backbone of our armies while the Masters and free ponies serve as officers and specialists."
 
 OAP_what_navy:0 "What the Tartarus is a Navy?"
 OAP_what_navy_desc:0 "What in Celestia’s name is a boat? You mean there are bodies of water big enough to have vehicles travel them? Well whatever the Tartarus a navy is, if other countries have them I want one too!"
 
 OAP_guns_on_boats:0 "Guns on Boats"
 OAP_guns_on_boats_desc:0 "Wait you mean to tell me they put guns on their boats. So that’s what a navy is. Alright, easy enough, we have plenty of guns, and we are starting to build boats, we’ll just combine the two. In a few months time we’ll be rolling up on the shores of our enemies! It will be like "Knock Knock. It’s Old Appleloosa. With huge boats (with guns)... gunboats.""
 
 OAP_buy_rowing_slaves:0 "Experienced Rowing-Slaves"
 OAP_buy_rowing_slaves_desc:0 "Other countries with navies are known to have many experienced rowers powering their ships. Luckily most of these rowers are also slaves, so I’m sure we’ll just be able to purchase a few of them for our own navy... Lets just hope they don’t ask why we need a navy."
 
 OAP_dockyards:0 "Build Actual Dockyards"
 OAP_dockyards_desc:0 "We have a handful of fishing docks, but that won’t cut it for a mass produced navy. We need to build actual dockyards that can build, supply, and launch new ships."
 
 OAP_river_fleet:0 "A River-Fleet"
 OAP_river_fleet_desc:0 "Our first ships will finally be put to sea, or more accurately put to the river. I can finally start projecting Appleloosa’s power even if it’s just across the rivers of the wasteland."
 
 OAP_desert_navy:0 "The Navy of a Desert-Country"
 OAP_desert_navy_desc:0 "For a landlocked Desert-Country, the concept of a Navy seems absurd. However, this is a foolish notion. All great powers have navies! Therefore if Appleloosa is going to become a great power we need a navy! That dream is finally coming to fruition."
 
 OAP_import_chems:0 "Import Chems"

It is our moral duty to see this wrong corrected, so that more ponies may enjoy the benefits of freedom and peace."
 
 OAP_rangers_new_conscription:0 "New Model Conscription Campaign"
 OAP_rangers_new_conscription_desc:0 "There is a new form of governance, one based upon the ideals of freedom and democracy. It is this which we aim to create, a splendid model for the rest of the Wasteland to follow. However, if we wish to make this into a reality, we are going to need every able bodied pony fighting alongside us. So join today, and help bring about a new model of government!"
 
 OAP_rangers_kill_inflation:0 "Hard Currency Reset"
 OAP_rangers_kill_inflation_desc:0 "We have had enough of dealing with the ever-fluctuating value of bottlecaps. From now on, all transactions within our land shall be conducted only in our new central currency. The freedombit (name subject to change) shall stand as the greatest currency in the Wasteland!"
 
 OAP_rangers_dedicate_war_economy:0 "Dedicate the Economy to War"
 OAP_rangers_dedicate_war_economy_desc:0 "Around every corner lies another foe. Slavers, mutants, and raiders alike all seek to strip away our liberties and destroy our nation. To this, we say: Let them come! Our ponies stand ready, our guns are drawn, and our hearts burn with the fire of freedom."
 
 OAP_rangers_ncr_path:0 "Going with Azuria"
 OAP_rangers_ncr_path_desc:0 "Though we are committed to our cause, we must admit that our force alone may not be enough to protect the ideal of freedom. We shall align with the emergent republic to the east. Together, we will make the future a reality."
 
 OAP_rangers_azuria_coop:0 "Azuria-Ranger Military Cooperation"
 OAP_rangers_azuria_coop_desc:0 "We shall seek to cooperate with the much larger military of our allies, so as to ensure that both of our armies have their flaws softened. For our part, we will provide their soldiers with specialized training and help them create a small elite within their army. On their end, they will send us more ponies to supplement our ranks."
 
 OAP_rangers_azuria_money:0 "The Azurian Currency"
 OAP_rangers_azuria_money_desc:0 "Trade is much more stable to the east, with their currency still holding value. In order to combat our own problems, we will combine our bottlecap supply with Azuria's own currency, in order to help balance out the effects of inflation."
 
 OAP_rangers_azuria_research:0 "Azurian Joint Training"
 OAP_rangers_azuria_research_desc:0 "By training alongside our allies forces we can improve upon our methods and capaibilities drastically. In this way, we can ensure that we maintain a military edge over our foes."
 
 OAP_rangers_azuria_investements:0 "NCR Investments"
 OAP_rangers_azuria_investements_desc:0 "It is a sad truth that the New Canterlot Republic is far more prosperous than we shall ever be. Fortunately, our allies may be willing to share some of their wealth with us. If we could get them to agree to select investments, we could make our own economy prosper."
 
 OAP_rangers_into_desert:0 "§AInto the Desert!§!"
 OAP_rangers_into_desert_desc:0 "§AOur nation now stands ready to begin spreading our ideals. Soon enough, those ponies of the south shall know the beauty and joy of liberty!§!"
 
 OAP_rangers_military:0 "Ranger Focused Military"
 OAP_rangers_military_desc:0 "Though it may not be possible for every soldier to be a Ranger, it is certainly possible for us to make our Rangers the backbone of the army. They shall serve as the very model of our armed forces: Brave, loyal, and above all else determined to see our freedom protected. Rangers, lead the way!"
 
 OAP_commanding_rangers:0 "A Ranger Government"
 OAP_commanding_rangers_desc:0 "Who better qualified to lead our nation than those Rangers who are willing to give their lives in its defence? From the highest offices in the land to the lowest positions, we can trust our Rangers more than anypony else to ensure that our government runs smoothly and efficiently."
 
 OAP_ranger_pa:0 "Lessons From the Other Rangers"
 OAP_ranger_pa_desc:0 "There exists another group of so-called Rangers known as the Steel Rangers. Though their goals and our own do not align, we can't deny their effectiveness if even half of what we hear about them is true. Perhaps we could learn from them and begin investing in equipment that would allow each one of our Rangers to serve as walking tanks."
 
 OAP_ranger_wargames:0 "Desert Wargames"
 OAP_ranger_wargames_desc:0 "Though we are veterans of desert warfare, there is always more to learn. Through conducting a series of training operations, we can better refine our tactics so as to ensure we remain undefeated on the battlefield."
 
 OAP_ranger_explosives:0 "Explosive Weapons Development"
 OAP_ranger_explosives_desc:0 "If there is one way to ensure a slaver is good and dead, it is to blow them into bloody giblets. We shall seek to create more sophisticated explosives for use in defeating our foes. With any luck, our enemies will run out of bodies before we run out of grenades."
 
 OAP_ranger_fireteams:0 "Rapidfire Weapons Development"
 OAP_ranger_fireteams_desc:0 "Heavy fully automatic weaponry is useful for both dealing with softly armored foes and suppressing heavier armored ones. It would do us well to begin investing in these sorts of weapons as yet another means to killing slaver scum."
 
 OAP_ranger_new_army:0 "The New Ranger Army"
 OAP_ranger_new_army_desc:0 "As time goes on, it is becoming increasingly clear that other nations across the Wasteland are trying to create the biggest armies possible. We deny this way of thinking. Instead, our army shall be the most elite to exist. Being outnumbered matters little if every one of ours can kill a hundred of theirs."
 
 OAP_ranger_better_blueprints:0 "Buy Blueprints From Abroad"
 OAP_ranger_better_blueprints_desc:0 "There are some fields which we are greatly lacking in, with little hope to improve our understanding through conventional means. The theatres of sky and water simply remain beyond our reach for the time being. However, we can still learn about them through the experience of others."
 
 OAP_ranger_hoofington_robots:0 "Hire Roboticists From Hoofington"
 OAP_ranger_hoofington_robots_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, we simply don't have enough soldiers to effectively defend our land. In order to solve this problem, we will seek out experts from the south to help us create automated soldiers able to fight in the stead of ponies."
 
 OAP_ranger_specialized_robotics:0 "Studying Wartime Robotics"
 OAP_ranger_specialized_robotics_desc:0 "During the Great War, Equestria relied heavily on robotic forces both domestically and on the front lines. By studying their designs, we can learn how to build better robots ourselves. With an army of steel mixed with an army of flesh, we will become unstoppable."
 
 OAP_ranger_las_pegasus_aircraft:0 "Hire Aeronauts From Las Pegasus"
 OAP_ranger_las_pegasus_aircraft_desc:0 "Far to the west is the grand city of Las Pegasus. Thanks to the political climate, many of the pegasi residing there would be willing to relocate to our own lands. Their experience would be invaluable towards giving us an edge in aerial combat."
 
 OAP_ranger_desert_motorisation:0 "Desert Motorization"
 OAP_ranger_desert_motorisation_desc:0 "Vehicles move far faster than ponies ever could. Cars, trucks, and tanks alike would all give us a definite edge when it comes to dealing with those who seek us harm."
 
 OAP_ranger_mechanized_spearhead:0 "A Mechanized Spearhead"
 OAP_ranger_mechanized_spearhead_desc:0 "A few heavily armored vehicles could punch through enemy lines with ease, cutting them off from reinforcements and allowing our own forces to move in. Tactics such as these will win us any war we fight, ensuring a grand victory at the end of the day."
 
 OAP_ranger_sand_behemoths:0 "Behemoths on a Sandy Sea"
 OAP_ranger_sand_behemoths_desc:0 "Tanks are one of the most fearsome innovations of the Great War. Each one is a metal beast, capable of laying waste to any who get in their way. With a small army of them, we could completely dominate all of our foes."

 oldappleloosa.1.title:0 "Red Eye's New Overseer"
 oldappleloosa.1.desc:0 "After the debacle that ended with the last \"Overseer\" Red Eye sent being crushed by a train car, he has sent another. This alicorn, who has requested that we refer to her has \"Consequtia\", has already proven to be a much more ruthless overseer than the last; A feat most thought to be impossible. She has already killed Steel Shackles for her failure to capture the ones responisble for her sister's death, and has now taken direct control over Old Appleloosa, putting us under Red Eye's direct control."

In even better news, it seems that the former leader of the slavers there, Steel Shackles, will no longer be a hinderance to our vision. Already we have seen an increase in the number of slaves coming from Appleloosa, and with the nexus of the Equestrian slave trade now under our command, we can expect that to grow even more."
 oldappleloosa.2.a:0 "Well okay then."

 oldapplestart.1.d:0 "It isn’t easy finding a home in this world.

There was another settlement, one which would become on of Old Appleloosa's earliest trading partners. They were..."

He claims credit for the rather impressive task of unifying the many different settlements, gangs, and warlords that once occupied the ruins of Fillydelphia. He has kindly offered to take all of our slaves off our hooves for a rather preferential rate. Caps would usually suffice as sufficient payment, but it seems that the Master of Fillydelphia has added in a little extra in exchange for future support of his plans. It would surely be rude to turn down such a generous offer of..."

 oldapplestart.4.t:0 "The Letter of 11"
 oldapplestart.4.d:0 "Groaning, Steel Shackles cupped his head in his hooves as he saw one of his crew enter what could be described as his office. His office was a hybrid between a modern workspace and an ancient torture chamber gone rusty. It could be used for both proper business and less proper 'business' alike. Without saying a single word, the slaver plopped a letter in front of Steel Shackles. It was a simple piece of paper, folded a couple of times and sealed with a bit of bloatsprite wax. On it, a seal with a single L marked its sender. Already, Shackles could feel his blood begin to boil. As the stallion ripped it open, he got up and trotted closer to the slaver who brought the letter. Softly, he mumbled the contents to himself and growled. Charming Luck, one of the merchants, along with some of the softies in the guild were wanting a guarantee from him. Oh, and some of the wimpier slavers, too. Great. Although they were only a total of eleven, they had enough clout that they could cause issues. Furrowing his brow, Shackles reread their demands. They wanted, in writing, guarantees that [RED.GetLeader] would not be given any of their own personal slaves in the case that he requested more than supply could provide. He huffed, and tossed the letter aside. Glancing over at the messenger, he snarled. Before the pony could react, he brought a knife into his hoof and jabbed it forward, the blade sinking into the chest of the pony with a soft squish. As blood dribbled out of the wound, the pony falling to the ground and shivering a bit as the liquid pooled on the floor, Shackles sighed and trotted around to his desk. Eying the dying slaver, he snapped, "That's what you get for bringing the boss bad news!" With a huff, he rested his fetlocks on the desk and ignored the spluttering of his victim. For a moment, the gears turned in his head. At last, he pushed back and grumbled as he trotted out the room..."

 oldapplestart.5.t:0 "The Farsight Problem"
 oldapplestart.5.d:0 "With a thump, a stack of papers flopped onto the desk of Charming Luck. Grunting, he waved a hoof dismissively at the unicorn that had dropped them off. Outside the small, slightly refurbished room, a cloud of dust was blowing by. Another storm, made even more dangerous primarily by the southern Wasteland being filled with all kinds of balefire radiation. After a moment, he shook his head, checking the report that had been left behind. With a start, he dropped the shipment manifests for his latest caravan and groaned, his heartbeat picked up again. From the top page, he could see what exactly had the aide so flustered. Written in bold ink, a statement from one of the caravan guards for his small coalition of merchants and minor slavers. "General" Farsight had struck again. At least thirty slaves had been liberated, and a good portion of the caravan crew left for dead. Without thinking, he began to fumble in his pocket, touching the sole pre-war bit he owned. He pulled it out briefly, inspecting the shiny golden surface for flaws beyond the few scratches it had when he got it. All he got was the smiling face of Princess Luna. Behind the facade, even though centuries old, he could tell that she was tired, worn, and saddened. Not unlike himself at the moment. For a moment, he stared at the report, its pages taunting him before he finally pushed back and called for his assistant. The Rangers weren't the hardest to find, in fact their base of operations was known to the slavers. It was just a matter of breaching it. Steel Shackles had attempted to deal with it several times, but the defenses of the restored military outpost easily stopped all raids. When his assistant, dressed about as sharply as he was, entered, carrying a few scraps of paper for notes, he cleared his throat and began. "In light of this recent attack, I have come to a conclusion about the Rangers," he began, feeling his chest grow tighter as he continued. "As they can't keep biting into our profits, let the others know that I have decided...""
 oldapplestart.5.a:0 "...to meet with the Ranger-General."
 oldapplestart.5.b:0 "...to deal with the Ranger-General once and for all."
 
 oldapplestart.6.t:0 "The Meeting"
 oldapplestart.6.d:0 ""Let's get down to business," Charming Luck grumbled, motioning to a small table in the center of the warehouse. He glared at Farsight, who likewise was inspecting him with stern eyes. The General's face was obscured by his helmet, but Luck could feel eyes behind the glowing lenses looking back at him. Wordlessly, Farsight sat down in one of the chairs. When Farsight remained quiet, Luck cleared his throat and stated, "I'm offering a deal." He flinched as Farsight laughed once. It was a dry, tired chuckle. "What kind of deal?" Farsight grunted, never changing his expression. Feeling a small surge of confidence, Luck declared, "Old Appleloosa needs a change in management. I'm intending to be that change." He smirked, sending Farsight a calculated look. "I could use further support, and in exchange for yours I could promise... benefits." Farsight remained silent. Luck began to tap his hoof impatiently on the table feeling his heartbeat beginning to rise. Farsight was going to reject his offer, he was sure of it. "What kind of benefits?" Farsight finally inquired, leaning forward and resting his hooves on the table. "You and your Rangers can keep your jobs, and continue playing hero out in the desert." Luck replied, waving a hoof dismissively and inwardly breathing a sigh of relief. Hopefully this would go well now. "And Old Appleloosa can be your prosperous home base. Steel Shackles may grovel and come up with excuses for [RED.GetLeader], but I think they are merely a tool for our economic benefit, and once we're finished with them, we'll simply throw off their influence." With a thump on the table, he pressed himself up and grinned at Farsight. He had got him, for sure. Indeed, Farsight muddled over the proposition. Scrunching his brow, he sighed and looked up at Luck. For a moment, the two locked gazes, and finally Farsight grumbled, "Fine, so long as you keep your end of the bargain." Jumping to his hooves, he grabbed Luck by the lapel of his suit and pulled him close. Luck could smell the stench of his breath, and he gagged. "Otherwise, you won't be in power for long, and I assure you that even the dreaded alicorns, or your own guards will be too slow to save you should I send my Rangers. Got it?" Whimpering, Luck nodded and brushed off his suit as Farsight let him go. As the two walked out of the warehouse, he stopped when he saw his guards huddled in a circle, surrounded by Rangers. They were supposed to provide protection in case things went south. However, it appeared they couldn't handle even basic orders.  "Release them," Farsight snapped, jabbing a hoof at the guards and turning to face Luck. Luck could hear the mirth in Farsights voice, as he gave the order, "Sorry, I couldn't be too careful. You can learn a thing or two living in the desert." With that, he motioned for his Rangers and they galloped off into the dust storm. As the winds whipped at Luck's mane, he glowered at his hired lieutenant."

Furthermore, our latest inventory check revealed that a large portion of our supplies, arms, and munitions have disappeared. To add to the mystery, any and all routes coming from Last Green have been completely cut off. Our few returning scouts have had little to say beyond reporting that there seems to be a great deal of activity within the known Ranger stronghold of Desert's Gate, with rumors that the settlement has been placed under a heavy lockdown.\n\n The disappearance of the Rangers, our sudden shortage of supplies, and the region of Last Green being seemingly cut off from our control all point toward a similar conclusion: Old Appleloosa is on the verge of a crisis."

Reports from other towns seem to confirm that not only the main body of the Rangers, but apparently every single Ranger in our territory has somehow slipped across our admittedly poorly guarded northern border.\n\nThe scouts also described the Ranger Citadel has having been stripped of anything useful, any ammunition either taken with the Rangers or burned in front of the gate. Within the mess hall, the scouts discovered the head of one of our assassins on a pike, Having obviously failed in his mission to take out the Ranger-General.\n\nWe suspect that our assasination attempt, combined with the Ranger's undermined military presence, has scared them into deciding to abandon their homes and search for a new land to settle in.\n\n With the Rangers in full retreat, the biggest threat to our rule has been eliminated and Old Appleloosa has been left more stable than ever before!"

News has begun to spread like wildfire throughout not only our beloved state of Appleloosa, but the entirety of the Wasteland: the spirit of Old Appleloosa still burns bright! Throughout all her still enduring settlers and peoples, we have finally managed to officially proclaim our secession from the slaver state, and begin to wage war against the tyrannical rule of Steel Shackles. The evil that has plagued Appleloosa for uncounted years will finally come to an end, being brought to justice by none other than those who have always fight for her freedom. While the reports of our proclamation being sent abroad are quite uplifting to all who hear, our internal populace is still shaken from the chaos that has erupted throughout all the settlements we have barely managed to recently acquire. Commotion has begun to spread throughout our settlements, and despite our careful years of preparation, we are still ill-prepared for the battles that lie ahead. Even though we have successfully managed to acquire our own supplies and munitions for the battles to come, we still lack the bodies needed to match the slavers. Every able-bodied pony that can wield a gun will be sent to the front lines, while those who cannot shall be put to work elsewhere. \n\n We will need every hoof we can get if we are to win this war and finally rescue Appleloosa from the evil that still holds her by a shackle!"

 oldappleranger.2.d:0 "Old Appleloosa's town square had been used for auctions for longer than anypony could remember. When the weather was fair, slavers would flock there from all across the Wasteland to place their bids. Of course, that hadn't been the case since the rise of the Appleloosan Rangers. With the entire region thrown into chaos, the slave trade was brought to a forcible halt. As the conflict continued, it found itself serving a very different purpose, as it become the site for constant executions. Deserting officers and captured enemies alike were made examples of, left hanging in the wind to remind everypony of the price of treason. These executions only grew more and more frequent as the civil war drew to a close. The fall of the city to the Rangers did not put a halt to this, instead just changing the targets of the executions.\n\n Now, with the bloody conflict brough to an end, an announcement has been made by the victor: There was to be one final series of executions. One final act of justice to be carried out. Attendance was mandatory for everypony who lacked anything better to do, as all were expected to come witness those enemies of liberty face the only fate they deserved.\n\n Near two dozen slavers were dragged out into the town square, clad in the very same chains that they had once used to bind their slaves. Among them were many prominent figures, most notably Steel Shackles himself. Despite being beaten and bloody, the stallion still managed to lift his head up to the sky and march forward with only a slight limp. This show of defiance would win him no favors though, as the gathered audience did little more than spit at him and curse his very name. He would be the first one to be brought before the Ranger-General Farsight, who began to speak to the assembled crowd..."

 oldappleranger.2001.d:0 "'Ponies of Old Appleloosa. The monsters before you are those slavers who once sought to enslave their fellow pony, who once arrogantly thought themselves so important so as to be allowed to own another life. They have been disabused of that notion, through the strength of our hooves and the resolve of our spirits. Now, the time has come at last for these creatures to face their just dues. For their crimes against both the Goddesses above and against the common decency present in all good folk, they shall all be sentenced to death. To begin with, those minor figures who held onto their twisted practice until the very end.'\n\n At this, a dozen of the slavers were roughly shoved and, in some cases, dragged up to the awaiting gallows. Once they were all in position, ropes tied securely around their necks, Ranger-General Farsight continued.\n\n 'These ponies were not the worst of their ilk. Yet, their crimes are as numerous as the lashings they gave their slaves. They fought in defence of the abominable practice of slavery and both contributed to and directly committed countless abuses against fellow ponies. For their crimes, they shall be sentenced to death by hanging. May they rot in Tartarus.'\n\n At this, a dozen platforms dropped, and a dozen bodies flailed in the open air, before all going limp. The Ranger-General wasted little time before addressing the crowd once more.\n\n 'Next up, those who were in positions of power within our fair nation. Power that they exploited to cause and defend countless attrocities. Yet, their contributions can not be denied. For all their work towards making Old Appleloosa what it is today, we shall extend them a mercy. All they must do is take a shovel and dig, in front of us all, to show humility.'\n\n Confusion was plain on the faces of many of the ponies present, though not a hint of emotion could be seen across any of the Rangers themselves. Every remaining slaver had their chains unlocked, and were offered a shovel to dig with. Most of them hesitantly accepted, while those few who resisted or refused were shot on sight."

 oldappleranger.2002.t:0 "The Day of Judgement"
 oldappleranger.2002.d:0 "The audience would be forced to sit and watch as those slavers who had once relied on the labor of others to do near everything for them were instead forced to engage in labor themselves for once. They dug and dug some more, with any who slowed being beaten until they continued in their duty. They knew not how deep they had to dig, just that they were to dig one large hole in the center of the square. Ranger-General Farsight looked on impassively as the digging continued, betraying little regarding what was to come next. As the hours ticked by, the hole grew deeper and deeper, until the digging was brought to a halt by the Rangers. The sweat soaked slavers were dragged out of their hole, their shovels confiscated as they were lined up along the lip of the pit they had created. For the first time in hours, Farsight spoke.\n\n 'Do you see now what kind of horrors you subjected your fellow pony to? The struggles of their labor that they were forced to endure for your own selfish interests? That was merely a fraction of what they went through, the smallest hint of the attrocities that you have all committed. For those crimes, you deserve to face fates worth than death. Fortunately for you, I am a stallion of my word. You shall all be given mercy, in the only way that I may allow.'\n\n Rangers began to get into position, guns readied and pointed towards those ponies at the edge of the pit. The reality of the situation came crashing down on the slavers, as any hope they might of had of being spared was utterly crushed. With one final nod from Farsight, gunshots rang out and several bodies fell back into their shared grave. The crowd, formerly disatisfied with Farsight's 'mercy', engaged in open celebration as the slavers were given their just dues. As the crowd cheered on, several Rangers brought out an iron barrel, from which they poured gasoline all over the bodies. A single match was lit and thrown down into the hole, setting it ablaze and creating a brilliant pyre of flame."

Even many of the Rangers, who had displayed little emotion throughout the day, cheered on the show of justice. However, there was still one more execution to be had. With a stomp of his hoof, Farsight redirected all attention to himself once more.\n\n 'To see those criminals, monsters, and fiends who once oppressed us to be granted their just dues is nothing short of majestic. I doubt I am alone in saying that I have waited a long time to see some of those bodies burn. I trust that they will still be burning by the time they hit Tartarus. However, there is one last execution to take place today. One last monster to be brought before the Goddesses.'\n\n At this, Steel Shackles himself was dragged towards the makeshift pyre. He was firmly held by two Rangers right at the edge, close enough for his fur to be singed by the flames.\n\n 'I don't think the stallion before you needs any introduction. He is nothing short of a monster, a creature who not only belongs in Tartarus but hails from it. His life has been one dedicated to nothing more than inflicting needless pain and suffering upon the good ponies of this world. The blood of countless ponies is on his hooves, and the recent war that tore our nation apart and brought brother against brother is all due to his malicious hatred for liberty. His list of crimes is so long that we would be here all day if I were to read even a portion of them. So, without any further delay, I hereby sentence Steel Shackles to death by fire.'\n\n The slaver in question began to furiously struggle against his bindings and the Rangers holding him. His resistance was met with nothing more than a shove forward, sending him tumbling down into the burning pile of bodies below. His muffled screams could be heard even through the steel bit fastened to him, as he was burned alive. For the first time that day, Ranger-General Farsight smiled."

Cousin Chainlink also proved to be a great help in this, helping Steel Shackles promote only those slavers who could be trusted to remain loyal to his rule.\n\n The future was truly a bright one for Old Appleloosa and for all slavers from it. They would be enjoying endless wealth and prosperity within the world of their invention. And they had Steel Shackles to thank for all of it."

 oldapplered.9.d:0 "White Spark could feel her lungs burning as she galloped across the barren land. Every step was another burst of pain, as her legs threatened to give out under her. Regardless, she kept on moving. If she made it far enough, she could live a free mare, a luxury she had never known. If she failed, well...\n\n A bullet impacted a rock to her right, prompting her to move even faster. These masters were by far some of the most sadistic she had ever known, hunting her and many other slaves for sport. Unfortunately, she knew that she had no hope of making it to the border in this condition. Ducking behind a nearby tree, she allowed her legs to fail. From the ground, she hoped to regain her breath before continuing the mad dash.\n\n What she did not know was that one of her hunters was much much closer than she had known. She would never see him, with her last memory being of a gunshot from her left. Her death would be just one of many that day, as no slave would be fast enough to escape pursuit."

 oldappleloosa.3.t:0 "Steel Shackles Fate"
 oldappleloosa.3.d:0 "Steel Shackles found that Old Appleloosa looked very different from this perspective. As the noose was placed around his neck, he could find little comfort in the cold glares of the ponies gathered to spectate. He could hardly believe he had once considered these ponies to be respectable slavers, his peers within that most noble of businesses. However, they had all taken off their masks and revealed themselves to be little more than traitors and crooks. Even Golden Shackles was among them! To think, his own family betraying him!\n\n As the list of crimes being read off reached its end, Charming Luck stepped out in front of the soon-to-be-dead slaver. That disgusting face stared at him with a smug grin, taunting him by asking for his last words. All he would get in response was a glob of spit launched at his traitorous muzzle.\n\n Wiping off the offending spit, Charming Luck stepped back and gave a simple nod to the executioner. With Steel Shackles dying before him and all of his supporters sentencd to exile, there were few left to oppose the new regime."
 oldappleloosa.3.a:0 "Let him hang!"
 
 oldappleloosa.4.t:0 "Battle for the Pie-Family Farm"
 oldappleloosa.4.d:0 "The Rock Farmers were not prepared in the slightest for our assault. The Pie-Family Farm, a well respected farmstead, was near entirely unprotected and fell quickly to our advance. Unfortunately, the element of surprise quickly wore off, and many militias from across the Rock Farmer's territory were rallied to oppose us. Their attempted counter-attack has already inflicted some casualties on our forces, though we did manage to hold our land. The question now is whether or not to fortify in preparation for yet another counter-attack or to push forward before they can regroup. The former would be the safer bet, but the later could allow us to seize even more land."
 oldappleloosa.4.a:0 "Dig in and wait"
 oldappleloosa.4.b:0 "Push further!"
 
 oldappleloosa.5.t:0 "A Proposal from the Old Appleloosa Confederacy"
 oldappleloosa.5.d:0 "The slaver state of Old Appleloosa has undergone quite a few changes as of late. Their new management has proven to be far more amibtious than their predecessors ever were, seeking to return to their traditional ways while empowering their nation. We have long since suspected that they would become a threat to our own reign, but we were caught unprepared by their offer to us.\n\nRather than seeking to conquer our nation, Old Appleloosa has instead purposed that we cooperate. At very least, they would like to create a trade deal between our two nations that we can both profit off of. However, they have also proposed the idea of going even further than that and creating a proper alliance.\n\n Though there are many benefits to such an arrangement, we must also be mindful of the possibility of getting tangled in their affairs. Should we accept their proposal and, if so, to what extent?"
 oldappleloosa.5.a:0 "A trade deal sounds great."
 oldappleloosa.5.b:0 "Our alliance shall prosper!"
 oldappleloosa.5.c:0 "We don't need them."
 
 oldappleloosa.6.t:0 "The Neocastle Trade Deal"

 oldappleloosa.6.a:0 "Wonderful."
 
 oldappleloosa.7.t:0 "Neocastle agrees to Military Alliance"
 oldappleloosa.7.d:0 "Word has come back today that Neocastle has agreed to a military alliance. This alliance, dubbed the Golden Circle, is committed to protecting the economic interests of all member states from any and all threats. With any luck, our pact may stand the test of time and bring us a great deal of wealth as we march into the future."
 oldappleloosa.7.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 
 oldappleloosa.8.t:0 "Neocastle rejects our Offer"
 oldappleloosa.8.d:0 "Word has come back today that Neocastle has rejected our proposal. It seems that they fear getting too involved in our own affairs, preferring instead to maintain a policy of neutrality towards us. While this is not entirely unexpected, it is still a bit of a disappointment. Without an ally in the north, we may find things grow more difficult for us moving forward."
 oldappleloosa.8.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 
 oldapplestart.99.t:0 "A Change in Management"
 oldapplestart.99.d:0 "As he rushed through a dim alleyway, Steel Shackles could think of little more than fear. Word had reached Old Appleloosa earlier that morning: Red Eye had died and Fillydelphia has entered a power struggle. Unfortunately, this news reached Charming Luck at the same time, and now a full on coup was underway. Slavers all across the city were out hunting for their former leader, either to rally around him or kill him.\n\n Turning a corner, Steel Shackles was met with the barrel of a rifle pointed at his face. Scrambling back and ignoring the orders to halt, he tried to return the way he came only to find a griffon mercenary blocking his path. Looking between the two rapidly approaching aggressors, he tried to pull out his knife. If he was going to die here today, he would at very least die fighting. However, all thoughts of resistance were blown out of his mind when a hole was similarly blown through his leg by a high caliber round. Collapsing into the dirt below, he could do nothing as the slaver and mercenary debated whether to kill him or bring him in, before agreeing on the later and dragging him away."
 oldapplestart.99.a:0 "The old regime ends, a new one begins."
 
 oldapplered.99.t:0 "The Unexpected Coup"
 oldapplered.99.d:0 "Steel Shackles mansion was always kept guarded, but today it had been turned into a real fortress. Sandbags, barricades, and makeshift fortifications alike all surrounded and filled his home. These measures, which would of been considered just a week ago to be alarmist, were currently being put to the test as the building found itself under siege. Word had traveled to Old Appleloosa that Red Eye has died. Unfortunately, this news had led to the Appleloosan Rangers launching a coup against the government. They and their surprisingly large amount of supporters have risen up all across the country, fighting with our slavers in every settlement we control.\n\n Though the coup has come as a complete surprise, the attack within our own capital came as an even greater surprise. A small army of Rangers seemingly came out of nowhere and attempted to put an end to Steel Shackles himself early this morning. Since then, the effort to hold them off and defend the rightful leader of Old Appleloosa has grown increasingly desperate.\n\n The slavers makeshift fort would finally fall due to a makeshift explosion blowing a hole through the east wings barricade. As dozens of Rangers rushed in through their breach, many of the defending slavers would surrender on the spot. Steel Shackles himself was found attempting to leave through a tunnel leading out of his cellar and was quickly apprehended after a brief firefight."
 oldapplered.99.a:0 "Well then."
