SPV_opening1:0 "Where We Came From"
SPV_opening1_desc:0 "Long ago, our people were scattered throughout the balefire-scorched Wasteland.

This background entails our traditions, as well as determining what we know."

SPV_opening2:0 "What We Did"
SPV_opening2_desc:0 "In those early days, our town found itself in a state of bickering over what path to take moving forward. Many of our founders proposed different plans and ideas, but only one of these would win out over the others."

SPV_opening3:0 "Who We Became"
