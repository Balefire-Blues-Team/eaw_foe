### Decisions ###
 foe_slaving_cat:0 "The Slave Trade"
 foe_slaving_cat_desc:0 "[Root.GetSlavingCatDesc]\n\nWe own £slave_text §Y[?foe_slaves_var] thousand§! slaves."

 FoeSlavingDescRED:0 "We sit upon the greatest center of industry the Wasteland has ever seen; §RFillydelphia, the city of slaves§!. Every one of [RED.GetLeader]'s great factories is manned by masses of slaves, as are the towns and fields across the §CHinterlands§!, but in order to maintain and expand our great empire, a steady supply of fresh meat is needed."
 FoeSlavingDescOAP:0 "Our little town sits at the crossroads of one of the greatest slave trades in the Equestrian Wasteland, a meeting place for slavers from §GThe Hoof§!, §CLas Pegasus§!, the §YSouthwest§!, and of course, §RFillydelphia§!. It is here in the sand-blasted town of §OOld Appleloosa§! where ponies are bought and sold, and we can only stand to profit from it."
 FoeSlavingDescGeneric:0 "The business of buying and selling ponies is a profitable one, and these ponies can be used in a variety of ways, should we have the political will to do so."

 foe_slave_mil_factory:0 "Reclaim an §GArms Factory§!"
 foe_slave_mil_factory_desc:0 "There were countless factories built for the war effort across Equestria, and they can be brought back to functionality once more. However, the years have not been kind to them, and they are often filled with automated defenses. Luckily for us, we have expendable slaves who can do all the hard work for us!"
 foe_slave_civ_factory:0 "Reclaim a §OGoods Factory§!"
 foe_slave_civ_factory_desc:0 "There were countless factories built supply all the needs of Equestria, and they can be brought back to functionality once more. However, the years have not been kind to them, and they are often filled with automated defenses. Luckily for us, we have expendable slaves who can do all the hard work for us!"
 foe_slave_army_xp:0 "Use Slaves in Wargames"
 foe_slave_army_xp_desc:0 "Wargames are a valuable part of keeping our army in tip-top shape, unfortunately, they often prove to be quite dangerous. The solution is to simply use slaves in the most dangerous spots, due to their expendable nature."
 foe_slave_settlers:0 "Forced Settlement"
 foe_slave_settlers_desc:0 "The wasteland is an empty place, and most of the land is unused, but we have a solution. By offering freedom to any slave who works and lives on an empty plot of land for 5 years, we can finally start settling the wastes."
 foe_slave_enslave_non_core:0 "Enslave Conquered Population"
 foe_slave_enslave_non_core_desc:0 ""
 OAP_western_slaves_2:0 "Buy £slave_text §Y2 thousand Slaves§! from the West"
