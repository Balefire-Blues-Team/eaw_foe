### Opening Focuses ###
 
 LIT_Starting_Focus:0 "The Weather Factory"
 LIT_Starting_Focus_desc:0 "The weather factory was once the pride and joy of Cloudsdale. Before the war, the factory regulated and manufactured Equestria's weather patterns, keeping the seasons in order. Now, it is nothing more than a shadow of its former self within the ruins of a once-great city."
 
 LIT_Starting_Focus_2:0 "The Fall of Cloudsdale"
 LIT_Starting_Focus_2_desc:0 "Cloudsdale was one of the first hit by the megaspells. Those who survived the blasts and didn't follow the Enclave on still skulk within the ruins. Hope drives them forward, towards what would hopefully be a brighter future. One that would be good for all the little ponies of the Wasteland."
 
 LIT_Starting_Focus_3:0 "The Thunder-War"
 LIT_Starting_Focus_3_desc:0 "The Thunder-War was a humiliating defeat suffered at the dirty claws of Featherbrush's Talons. They have been a menance to us ever since. If we were to do nothing except wallow in our humiliation without addressing our shortcomings, then we would only taste defeat once more. This is unacceptable."
 
 LIT_assembly_is_called:0 "The Assembly"
 LIT_assembly_is_called_desc:0 "The Assembly of Tribes has always been what elevated us above the neighbours that surround us. Semi-annually, the semi-autonomous tribal villages that are unified under one banner convene together to discuss their problems and work together to solve them. We must hold onto this ideal if we wish to carry on in the face of adversity."
 
 
 ### Industry ###
 
 LIT_economic_matters:0 "Economic Matters"
 LIT_economic_matters_desc:0 "Our economy suffer from many woes and difficulties. It would be prudent for us to address our economic situation so that we can make our little corner of Old Equestria just a little bit more prosperous, a little more bountiful to the ponies that live here."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale:0 "Prepare Cloudsdale for Reconstruction"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_desc:0 "The pegasi that once lived around the remains of their ancestral home in the Cloudsdale ruins formed the foundation of our system, now it is time for us to return that favour. We can help rebuild. It will be difficult, but it will also be worth it."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_infrastructure:0 "Infrastructure Around Cloudsdale"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_infrastructure_desc:0 "The infrastructure we have around Cloudsdale is a joke. What little we have are loosely cobbled-together structures always at risk of collapse and always vulnerable to attacks from ghouls or other scavengers. It is time to make sure we live in better conditions."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_scavenge:0 "Scavenge What Can't Be Repaired"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_scavenge_desc:0 "Yes, there are plenty of things that can't be repaired. But the wonders of the Old World are plentiful and there for us to take. What could be replaced should be replaced. It is clear that this could never go wrong in any way, shape, or form."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_cloudship:0 "A Magnificient Find"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_cloudship_desc:0 "We have managed to find something magnificent! A cloudship was discovered in our searches through the ruins and now, perhaps we will have the opportunity to improve upon our situation."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_settling:0 "Begin Settling the Outskirts"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_settling_desc:0 "The outskirts have always been quite close to being empty and desolate, but this will not do. If we fail to use our territory effectively, then we would only leave ourselves vulnerable to our neighbours. We must settle those outermost peripheries."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_factories:0 "Repair Some of the Cloud-Factories"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_factories_desc:0 "Our repeated attempts at reshaping the Cloudsdale ruins bore fruit. Now, there is an unprecedent opportunity for us to repair those old, defunct cloud-factories so that, once more, Cloudsdale's old glories could be restored."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_finish:0 "A Proud City Once More!"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_finish_desc:0 "Finally, Cloudsdale can stand amongst the proud cities of the Equestrian Wasteland once more. It's not what it once was, to be sure. Far from it. But now we can at least point to our shining city in the Wasteland and say its name with pride."
 
 LIT_country_whole:0 "Our Country as a Whole..."
 LIT_country_whole_desc:0 "Though Cloudsdale has once again become a great and powerful industrial centre, our country can't build off of Cloudsdale alone, no matter how much we would wish for it to be so. The Hinterlands and the isolated settlements that make up the rest of our territory need to be developed with just as much care."
 
 LIT_country_streets:0 "Build Streets Between Settlements"
 LIT_country_streets_desc:0 "There are few streets that connects our settlements. It would be nice if the ponies could finally enjoy paved roads again. Our roadworks project will surely reduce travel time and set the ground for more ambitious construction projects down the line."
 
 LIT_country_power:0 "Our Own Electricity"
 LIT_country_power_desc:0 "It is paramount that we are energy-sufficient. Whatever we can do to make our little piece of the Wasteland be filled with electric lights and all the splendors of the old world will surely motivate our people to believe in our ideals with stronger conviction."
 
 LIT_country_enterprise:0 "Encourage Private Enterprise"
 LIT_country_enterprise_desc:0 "Small businesses are setting up shops here, the caravans came and unloaded their weary wagons of goods here. Perhaps all of those are good, positive actions that need to be encouraged. Give them some room trade and sell."
 
 LIT_country_clearance:0 "Wide-Scale Land Clearance"
 LIT_country_clearance_desc:0 "The end of Old Equestria gave way for nature to take control of much our land and left our cities enveloped within dense forestry and populated by little critters. The rubble and the Wasteland environment must be cleared away and reshaped to better accomodate our little ponies. Comfortable living will be our ultimate goal."
 
 LIT_country_closer:0 "Closer Together now"
 LIT_country_closer_desc:0 "It is fair to say that our little, scrappy piece of the Wasteland become the start of something beautiful. The hustle and bustle of trade and growing communities that are now more and more interconnected thanks to our roads renewed our bonds with each other. What was once just a loose connection of wastelanders struggling to survive now feels connected to a national purpose and a greater community."
 
 LIT_country_finish:0 "A Modern Wasteland Nation"
 LIT_country_finish_desc:0 "Hurrah! Three cheers for the hard work that we've done thus far, for now we can finally call ourselves a true model for the Wasteland to follow. Surely those who subsist upon the scraps tossed aside by those slavers will see our progress as a beacon of hope."
 
 LIT_apple_ambition:0 "Appleloosan Ambitions"
 LIT_apple_ambition_desc:0 "Now that we have industrialized and modernised sufficiently, it is time that we carry the torch of progress to the rest of the Appleloosan region. How can we be comfortable, knowing our neighbours are starving, impoverished, and in need of upliftment? It betrays every one of our treasured ideals to not help!"
 
 LIT_OAP_railroad:0 "South-Appleloosan Railroads"
 LIT_OAP_railroad_desc:0 "The new proposed ideas for the railroads had been met with skepticism in the past, after all, much of what remained of the old railroad hubs had been taken and reappropriated by slavers and raiders. But now with us as a beacon of hope in the Appleloosan region, perhaps we can build those railways again connect us fellow ponies closer together."
 
 LIT_lichenfield_glass:0 "Lichenfield Glass Factory"
 LIT_lichenfield_glass_desc:0 "The Lichenfield Glass Factory was an ambitious idea, to be sure, but one that will be necessary in order for us to properly rebuild as a nation. After all, the bombs had shattered the windows of many a fine buildings. Perhaps if we could repair some of those buildings, we could begin making progress towards something beautiful."
 
 LIT_OAP_solar:0 "Desert Solar-Farms"
 LIT_OAP_solar_desc:0 "It many seem ridiculius to many that we are developing alternative methods of energy harvesting in the Wasteland. We were not builders, but rather scavengers for much of our past. It is an uncomfortable truth, but all of our projects have culminated in this idea of taking something once left behind in the Wasteland and improving upon it. We will restore these ancient solar-farms so that no pony will feel cold in the winter again!"
 
 LIT_OAP_gun_foundries:0 "Nationalize Ranger Gun Foundries"
 LIT_OAP_gun_foundries_desc:0 "The Gun Foundries are an integral part of our military apparatus, we cannot leave them in the hands of private interests, and so they must be placed under the supervision of our direct administration. It is high time that our forces have guns they could count upon, created for them by us."
 
 LIT_NAP_integration:0 "North Appleloosan Trade Cooperation"
 LIT_NAP_integration_desc:0 "The NATC will be a thing of beauty, a true testament to inter-regional harmony and cooperation. When the trade flows so freely, all of our little ponies will prosper. Our continued nation-building efforts have once again proven that we are the beacon of hope in this blighted land."
 
 LIT_NAP_settle_artisans:0 "Appropriate Appleloosan Artisans"
 LIT_NAP_settle_artisans_desc:0 "Our artisans are the best in Appleloosa, and perhaps the best in all the land! But we need to make sure those who had come to settle here could truly provide value to us. We must always prioritise how their talents could contribute to the great effort to rebuild, after all."
 
 LIT_NAP_monopolies:0 "Monopolize Appleloosan Trade"
 LIT_NAP_monopolies_desc:0 "We are the dominant trading power in the region, we hold control that no other powers before us save Old Equestria could claim. Celestia Herself would surely be proud of what we have done with this place. It is only rational, then, that we allow for no other competitors. They cannot be better than us, after all. So why let them even try?"
 
 LIT_NAP_precision_manufacturing:0 "Invest in Precision Manufacturing"
 LIT_NAP_precision_manufacturing_desc:0 "Precision manufacturing, centuries ago, led to the Appleloosan region flourishing with well-produced equipment and fine products. We would do well to remember the lessons of the past and apply them to the present, so that we may have a better future."
 
 LIT_ROK_ports:0 "The Ports of Hoof City"
 LIT_ROK_ports_desc:0 "Hoof City has continued to be a trade hub for all those who still have the capability of conducting maritime trade and a centre for naval construction. It would be in our interests to develop them so that we could once again see the sea from coast to coast."
 
 LIT_ROK_moar_rocks:0 "Increase Rock Production"
 LIT_ROK_moar_rocks_desc:0 "The Rock Farms of the past had not survived well after the mega-spells caused the collpase of our civilisation, they were chronically under-producing and often in a state of disrepair. There are several options outlined to increase rock production so that we may have the ability to set more and more ambitious quotas in the future."
 
 LIT_ROK_east_settlement:0 "Settle East Appleloosa"
 LIT_ROK_east_settlement_desc:0 "East Appleloosa is filled with hostile critters and a harsh environment that had led to it being less settled than the other regions of Appleloosa. The overabundance of raiders and slavers that called this plaxce home deterred many from settling down here. It is high time we rectified this by encouraging more emigration through monetary incentives and local benefits."
 
 LIT_ROK_composites:0 "Subsidize Composite Production"
 LIT_ROK_composites_desc:0 "We have truly become an industralised powerhouse in the region, but we must not be satisfied with just this. We could do more, and our ambitions are chafing at the edges of what we are realistically capable of, so it is only logical that we offer subsidies to incentivise even more growth. To reach higher than we have in the past, and to create more jobs, our little ponies will surely thank us for this undertaking."
 
 LIT_dream_fulfilled:0 "The Dream, Fulfilled!"
 LIT_dream_fulfilled_desc:0 "It has been a long journey of industrialisation but our hard work has bore us fruit. We stand tall in the bright sunny south, in peace and content. We will defend our vision, and perhaps share this once and future dream with of Equestria."
 
 ###Emergency###
 
 LIT_emergency1:0 "Emergency Mobilization"
 LIT_emergency1_desc:0 "The Ministry of Arcane Sciences had seen fit to disturb the fragile peace of the region by way of war. This is unacceptable, they seem to be under the impression that we would be nothing but pushovers. They are wrong. To arms! We shall defend our home to the last mare standing!"
 
 LIT_emergency2:0 "Confiscate Civillian Arms"
 LIT_emergency2_desc:0 "The war has developed not necessarily in a way that is conductive to the betterment of our wonderful economy. We must ask for our civilians to support our troops at the front by relinquishing their old weaponry, however hard this may come to our populace. Our home must be defended from the old Ministry's belligerence, and we need more guns."
 
 LIT_emergency3:0 "Everypony to the Front!"
 LIT_emergency3_desc:0 "To the front! Your home must be defended! How can we beat back the barbarous Ministry at the door if we lack soldiers? Our land will not be sacrificed, and we shall not budge from our positions. Ponies, we need you there at frontlines! We shall overcome them with our numbers and liberate them from the tyrannies imposed upon them by their Minister!"
 
 LIT_emergency4:0 "Prepare a Fallback Line"
 LIT_emergency4_desc:0 "The war situation has developed perhaps not necessarily to our advantage. It has become a necessity to fall back to a more defensible position to excise their poison and hold fast. We have to begin construction of a new fallback line. Only then will we have a chance of ever mounting a counter-attack."
 
 LIT_emergency5:0 "Our Last Stand"
 LIT_emergency5_desc:0 "Is this the end of the line for us? No! We shall never surrender to the likes of them, nor shall we capitulate to their own foolish and short-sighted whims. Our ideals have held us together for so long, it shall not betray us now. Behind every city, every town, every street, and every house there shall be us. We will not give them the satisfaction of being docile subjects in our last days! We will take our stand!"
 
 
 ###Military###
 
 LIT_reform_armed_forces:0 "Reforming our Meager Forces"
 LIT_reform_armed_forces_desc:0 "It has been an inescapable reality for much of our history that what pathetic remains of our 'military' would not be able to compete with any of our much stronger neighbours. If we continue to be complacent in the face of danger, then we are only inviting another humiliating defeat like the Thunder-War. Reforms must be implemented."
 
 LIT_spec_ops_focus:0 "Focus on Special Forces"
 LIT_spec_ops_focus_desc:0 "Our special forces have not always been able to be trained to the standard that was expected of them. In order to prepare against any invasion by our neighbour, we must have reliable and elite units at the ready to fight harder than the average pony troops. Therefore, we must prioritise training up the best of the best, no matter the cost."
 
 LIT_united_in_service:0 "United in Service"
 LIT_united_in_service_desc:0 "United forever, in friendship and service. Our mighty forces will endure against the hardest challenges and survive through even the darkest days and the stormiest nights! Long live our ideals! The Wasteland will never extinguish our free and unified ideals. As ponies, we stand together in diversity, against hate and slavery. Our names will bre echoed through history, for we are stronger together."
 
 LIT_anti_tank:0 "Steelcrackers"
 LIT_anti_tank_desc:0 "Our latest technological innovations will surely destroy even the mightiest invaders at our doorstep. Those so-called 'anti-machine weapons' are perfect for our purposes against the enemies who wish to mobilise any sort of mechanised forces against us. Our top researchers have already been struggling night and day to find ways to better integrate those new measures into our existing forces. We pray to Celestia that they will be enough."
 
 LIT_spec_doctrine:0 "Our Specialized Doctrine"
 LIT_spec_doctrine_desc:0 "In the face of insurmountable odds, we must still be prepared. No matter what the world may choose to throw at us, we can be reassured by our general staff's new ideas on how we may overcome those struggles. Already, there have been echoes of reforming our chain of command to adhere to either the war doctrines or to use the doctrines perfected through bloodied fighting in the Wasteland. In the end, we can only hope we have a right choice."
 
 LIT_value_mobility:0 "The Value of Mobility"
 LIT_value_mobility_desc:0 "Speed has always held a special place in our hearts. No matter how dangerous their weapons, if we can evade their attacks, then we will always remain unscathed. For mobility will give us greater manuevarbility in this blasted hellscape. All we can hope for is to best them by tactics or by speed, even if we must fight against a greater power than we."
 
 LIT_PA_research:0 "Power Armor Research"
 LIT_PA_research_desc:0 "The most beautiful and terrifying symbol of Old Equestria was their power armor soldiers, which remain as the undisputed kings of the battlefield, regardless of theatre or terrain. We must hasten our research in resotring those old glories so that we too can claim dominance over our foes. They will be in for a bitter surprise if they see us as just a docile stepping stone to future greatness."
 
 LIT_mass_inf_focus:0 "Focus on Massed Infantry"
 LIT_mass_inf_focus_desc:0 "Numbers will overcome any deficit or shortcomings that still remain in our military forces. So long as our soldiers have the will and are willing to risk it all for our great ideals, then victory would only be inevitable. We will seize the day, in the face of such overwhelming danger there will be countless ponies eager to join up with us to fight. On-hooves, we will be unparalleled."
 
 LIT_chems_research:0 "Increase Chem Production"
 LIT_chems_research_desc:0 "We shall produce more chems so that our ponies will not falter on the battlefield and be ready fight for another day. It may be a drastic measure to relentlessly increase production, but we will be able to fulfil those new quotas. It is certain that greater ambitions could not be caged by timidness and a hesitation to place more funding into our military. There can never be enough bottlecaps invested in our soldiers!"
 
 LIT_universal_doctrine:0 "Doctrine Research"
 LIT_universal_doctrine_desc:0 "We will continue in our research for the greater understanding of how to prosecute wars in the modern day. It was clear that no matter what it was, we can always improve upon the foundations that we built so that our home will be secured against those horrid forces that dare amass outside our borders. It is clear, our path forward is no longer shrouded in fear and uncertainty."
 
 LIT_virtue_bravery:0 "The Virtue of Bravery"
 LIT_virtue_bravery_desc:0 "The outsiders are not like us, we are the only ones truly capable of bravery and good virtuous discipline in the Wasteland. Our rise to greatness was inevitable, and this understanding must be reinforced on every level within our soldiers and officer corps. They must not give in to fear and be ever-resilient, not matter what it is they face. We plant our hooves in the ground, and will not take even a single step back."
 
 LIT_grenades_for_all:0 "Grenades for Everypony!"
 LIT_grenades_for_all_desc:0 "Grenades are the future of our mighty initiative. It has been clear from the very beginning how useful incendiaries can be. You get a grenade! You get a grenade! Check under your seats and you will find more grenades there! Everyone get grenades! The time for fun explosions have come, and we shall bring them to the battlefield with joy in our hearts and a spring in our hoof-steps."
 
 LIT_gun_research:0 "Military Research Initiative"
 LIT_gun_research_desc:0 "Our military research initiatives requests ever more funding, and we are more than happy to comply with their every demand. We cannot risk falling behind our rivals and neighbours lest they see as weak and ripe for the picking. As we progress further in our technological research and innovate where they have failed, we will remain triumphant. Our arsenals will be stocked with only the most advanced and powerful weaponry for our fine soldiers."
 
 LIT_illustrious_elite:0 "The Illustrious Elite"
 LIT_illustrious_elite_desc:0 "The elites have always supported our many plans, our greates amibitions, and was there even in our most humiliating elite. The time has come for us to reward them for their steadfast nature by allowing them a bigger share of the military and for them to contribute to our efforts by placing them as a part of our process of reforming the military. They shall join, and they shall be grateful for the privilege of doing so."
 
 LIT_more_bodies_bullets:0 "More Bodies Than Bullets"
 LIT_more_bodies_bullets_desc:0 "The soldiers we have are not enough to satisfy the basic requirements drafted up by our War Committee, it is clear to us that we require more and more societal participation in our armed forces or else we will be vulnerable to the outsiders. We must never show even a moment of weakness against those who conspire against us."
 
 LIT_airforce_1:0 "Foundations of an Airforce"
 LIT_airforce_1_desc:0 "We may not have much of what most would call an 'airforce' but we have the capacity to create one, to be sure. Our strong industrial base and connection to the skies have given us more than enough of a headstart compared to our neighbours in terms what we can do in terms of aerial combat. We would do well to expand upon the foundations here and truly create a terrifying and 'awesome' force in the skies that our enemies shall never look up to the skies without feeling fear."
 
 LIT_airforce_2:0 "Fighter Development"
 LIT_airforce_2_desc:0 "The development of fighter planes have come at a steady and acceptable pace. We are more than ready to integrate them into our newly created airforce at this point in time."
 
 LIT_airforce_3:0 "Attack-Plane Development"
 LIT_airforce_3_desc:0 "The continued development of attack-planes have been a boon for our now-formidable air force. Though we have been progressing along these lines quite nicely for a while now, it is easy to see that our continued research into aerial efforts will ensure that we remain unchallenged and unmatched. All creatures of the sky shall soon find themselves outmatched by our might!" 
 
 LIT_airforce_4:0 "Aerial Doctrines"
 LIT_airforce_4_desc:0 "The aerial doctrines we have available before us give us many oppotunities to refine our ability to engage in combat high above the clouds and to wage war on land. After all, if no other airforce could challenge us in the sky, how could they ever hope to beat our little ponies on the battle on land?"
 
 LIT_airforce_5:0 "Construct Airship-Yards"
 LIT_airforce_5_desc:0 "The Airship-Yards of Old Equestria have since became useless and impossible to repair. If we are to climb to ever higher heights of greatness, then we must construct newer Airship-Yards fit-for-purpose. Our hope as ponies will rest in our capacity to maintain a great formidable military force. Let's hope it will forever be terrifying and majestic in the eyes of our enemies."
 
 LIT_navy_1:0 "Countruct Dockyards"
 LIT_navy_1_desc:0 "Naval capabilities werre an oft-neglected aspect of our military as the old tri-service arrangement fell to the wayside as the Old Equestrian Navy was left unsalvageable by us and too distant an ambition to seriously consider. But now we must have some hope of building a small force that could one day become something greater. We may still have a chance at rebuilding what was once lost to us."
 
 LIT_navy_2:0 "Primitive Designs"
 LIT_navy_2_desc:0 "It is true that our designs are primitive. Much worse than what our ancestors had to make do with, but this is the reality at hoof we have to deal with. Our technological capacity have not given us an advantage in the matter of remaining unchallenged, so for now we must contend with shakey rafts and wooden canoes. Our time will come."
 
 LIT_navy_3:0 "Naval Armaments"
 LIT_navy_3_desc:0 "The Equestrian Navy once dominated the seas, and soon we shall as well! We shall launch scavenging efforts to find the naval weaponry of the old world with which we may secure our waterways. One day, we shall even sail across the ocean and become the greatest naval power of the Wasteland. We shall build towards that future with eager anticipation."
 
 LIT_navy_4:0 "A Seafaring Doctrine"
 LIT_navy_4_desc:0 "A proper way to conduct our forces at sea will imminently necessary if we are to strive for ever grander ambitions. Left unchecked, our coastlines will become vulnerable to hostility and the enemy that cry for our blood will never let us rest in the easy hope of peace. It is a priority, then, to make our navy know how we plan to fight at sea, in the rivers, and perhaps even further beyond."
 
 LIT_navy_5:0 "Behemoths of the Sea"
 LIT_navy_5_desc:0 "Our mightiest and proudest plans will be to build those mechanical monsters that will leave nopony unsafe. Those behemoths will defend us to our very last breath and keep our dreams aflame. It may be ambitious, but we will be certain then that our might as a naval power will remain unchallenged for many years to come if those grand plans come to fruition."
 
 ###Political###
 
 ###Revanchist###
 
 LIT_shake_things_up:0 "Shaking Things Up"
 LIT_shake_things_up_desc:0 "Our political system have been stagnating for far too long, it is clear that new leadership is needed if we are to ever to reclaim our past glories and pay the Featherbrush Talons back for our humiliating defeat in the Thunder-War."
 
 LIT_revanchist_coalition:0 "Reaffirm the Coalition"
 LIT_revanchist_coalition_desc:0 "It is an undeniable advantage that works in our favour that there are many who are of like mind on the issue of exacting sweet revenge on our enemies. Together, we shall march towards our shared goal of bringing our wrath down upon those who would oppose us."
 
 LIT_deal_with_plainsraiders:0 "A Deal With the Plainsraiders"
 LIT_deal_with_plainsraiders_desc:0 "The Plainsraiders are weak and as degenerate as the rest of the savages that populate the Wasteland, but it cannot be denied that they are a convenient ally for the time being. Perhaps at this moment in time, it would be to our benefit to strike a deal with them. This will not come to bite us in the back at any future point in time, of course."
 
 LIT_black_market_weapons:0 "Buy Up Rare Weapons"
 LIT_black_market_weapons_desc:0 "Those rare weapons that we've only heard about and have never seen before could play a decisive role in future warfare. It is imperative for us to acquire those wonderful and hard-to-find old era weapons. There have been plenty of stories of what destruction and calamity could be caused by even one lone wanderer armed with the right type of weaponry."
 
 LIT_push_out_the_complacent:0 "Push Out the Complacent"
 LIT_push_out_the_complacent_desc:0 "Now is the time for the complacent to pay. They have been making decisions for us for way too long. It is clear that this can no longer stand. Their presence is no longer tolerated nor welcomed in our midst, it is high time to show them that their inaction and weakness are no longer what drives us. It is only the sweet thought of revenge and conquest that will drive us forward now. Like lightning, we strike."
 
 LIT_second_thunder_war:0 "The Second Thunder-War"
 LIT_second_thunder_war_desc:0 "And so it begins. Our glory and honour will be restored, and the ponies of the Wasteland will finally know the true superiority of our ways. There will no longer be anymore barbarism for us to tolerate, for we have prepared for this moment and we shall finally be triumphant! This day will be won by us and us alone!"
 
 LIT_inevitable_conclusion:0 "The Inevitable Conclusion"
 LIT_inevitable_conclusion_desc:0 "It was inevitable. The conclusion for this pitiful conflict was written long before the drums of war had finished their mighty tune. We had the ponies, the industry, and all the resources this Wasteland could afford us. In this blighted land, we stand unbowed. We can clearly see that more glory and victories will be with us in the future, for that is our destiny. This will be our era, and our era will be unchallenged and unopposed, no matter who dares to question our supremacy and our rightful way of life."
 
 LIT_hook_hoof_wins:0 "§RHook Hoof Wins Out§!"
 LIT_hook_hoof_wins_desc:0 "After several days of fighting in the streets, the Enclavists have finally been driven from the cities, and in the end it was made clear that those upstarts will never amount to anything. They may scream their little slogans and fly around like headless chickens, but they had no true vision. It was to be expected, really."
 
 LIT_kill_enclavists:0 "Root Out Enclavist Supporters"
 LIT_kill_enclavists_desc:0 "Our nation faced a great test, one which we have passed with flying colors. Their pathetic barricades and meagre resistance was nothing compared to the might of our abilities and the determination of our nation to improve and to stand on our four hooves in the Wasteland. So it comes down to this, we will stamp that which remains of our pathetic foes, who have been demoralised by defeat after defeat. Soon, nothing will remain of them and we shall truly stand unopposed."
 
 LIT_march_plainstown:0 "March Unto Plainstown"
 LIT_march_plainstown_desc:0 "Now it is clear what our next course of action shall be: to march down to Plainstown and truly demonstrate the popularity of our movement and our strength in numbers. This will send a message to those who might still harbour thoughts of going against us; we shall remain a threat to all those who think we will bow down to them. We take this as a point of pride."
 
 LIT_assimilate_warbands:0 "Assimilate the Warbands"
 LIT_assimilate_warbands_desc:0 "The warbands have remained outside of our control for far too long, it is intolerable that the status quo can be allowed to continue on any further. They will be integrated into our great plans and structures, and this shall come to pass whether they want to or not. It is time for action."
 
 LIT_ploughshares_swords:0 "Plowshares Into Swords"
 LIT_ploughshares_swords_desc:0 "The ponies of the Wasteland will know of our might and they shall say, 'Come, let us go up to the restored city of Cloudsdale, to know of the greatness that they posses. For out of the ashes of Old Equestria shall go forth instruction, and the word of their unity in strength.' We shall judge the nations of the Wasteland, for they are weak. Come, it is a time for war; let us beat our plowshares into swords, and our pruning hooks into spears."
 
 LIT_prepare_great_struggle:0 "Prepare to Reunite Appleloosa"
 LIT_prepare_great_struggle_desc:0 "Our greatest ambitions is at hand! Arise, great nation, and march forth to reclaim the anciet mantle of Appleloosa! For too long, this region has remained locked in decay and division. The seeds of discord sown between the hearts of the gentle ponies from here to the coast of Manehatten. No longer can we tolerate such a sorry state of affairs, we must liberate our fellow ponies from themselves! To war!"
 
 LIT_des_fuck_OAP:0 "Through the Desert to Seize the Oasis"
 LIT_des_fuck_OAP_desc:0 "We cannot abide by the stain that is Old Appleloosa to exist much longer. Their current system is abominable, a mess, and a blight upon the Wasteland. They have no future in our dreams of a greater, and more united Wasteland. Their independence is joke, and they shall know what it means to be under our control."
 
 LIT_des_fuck_NAP:0 "Burning the Lone City"

 LIT_des_fuck_ROK_desc:0 "The Rock Farmers are a stubborn breed amongst the Wasteland. They remained steadfast in the face such overwhelming pressure from all sides.

 LIT_des_fuck_everyone:0 "What Lies Beyond..."
 LIT_des_fuck_everyone_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our dreams of control over an unified region, it is clear that we must continue our war of self-defense. How can we remain secure knowing that there still more foes out there, eyeing our recent gains with envy and ambition?

 LIT_acceptance_educate_masses_desc:0 "Enclave technology seem like they are truly from another era.

 LIT_keep_to_tradition_desc:0 "Sanity prevailed. It seems that, if we can keep it, a national ideal of continuity and shared heritage will be what binds us together, not any sense of misguided tribalism or supremacist ideals. This is our way of life, so let us preserve it carefully."
 
 LIT_shakespar_has_won:0 "§AVictory for the Status Quo§!"
 LIT_shakespar_has_won_desc:0 "The Status Quo exists for a reason, if we do not defend it, then our past will be destroyed. The traitors to our nation would sell us out to whatever faction they deem the strongest. We are better than that.

 LIT_crack_down_extremists_desc:0 "The Revanchists, in due time, will be given their chance to speak. However, there is a certain process to all things that allows every voice to be heard.

Their voices will be supressed until stability is restored."

 LIT_trade_water_OAP_desc:0 "We may throw our hooves up in dismay at the practices of Old Appleloosa, but trade and mutual propserity is the right way to conduct ourselves on the international stage. Surely once they see the benefits of freeing the ponies through economic incentives, we will have a better time at convincing them of our way life. Water, as with many things in this blasted wasteland, is a scarce necessity that all nations are in dire need of. Old Appleloosa may even be willing to pay a premium for it."
 
 LIT_erase_past_loss:0 "Forget the Memories"
 LIT_erase_past_loss_desc:0 "The Thunder-War was one of our greatest defeats, still plaguing our public consciousness to this very day.

We must seek to heal these scars, by correcting the mistakes of the past and turning towards a brighter future."
 
 LIT_spy_on_stabledwellers:0 "Spy on the Stableponies"
 LIT_spy_on_stabledwellers_desc:0 "The stableponies, you can't trust that lot. Now, we're no bigots, we just have some reasonable concerns in regards to those shifty newcomers into the Wasteland. They don't assimilate, and they keep to themselves. Even when they're cooped up in the stables, you never know what they're really thinking. And that's just the worst, ain't it? We gotta keep few tabs on them lest they steal the rug out from under us."
 
 LIT_restrore_relations_fta:0 "Restore Relations With Featherbrush"
 LIT_restrore_relations_fta_desc:0 "Now Featherbrush, that's a fellow you can trust.

 LIT_rightfully_ours_desc:0 "Now, finally, we are where we would most like to be. We have secured our place in the world without betraying our old ideals.

 LIT_seperation_of_races:0 "Separate Towns for Separate Tribes"
 LIT_seperation_of_races_desc:0 "We are different, but it does not mean that we truly need to be harsh. Neigh, we are not barbaric, and our yoke is light and easy to bear. It is clearly necessary for the Three Tribes to recognise the necessity of segregation. We can be equal, separately..."
 
 LIT_ministry_roads:0 "Ministry Roads"
 LIT_ministry_roads_desc:0 "Ministry roads for Ministry towns. They will be a boon to the local economy. We, of course, support all Ministry initiatives whole-heartedly without reservations. After all, they have only our best interests at mind, as we do theirs."

 LIT_ministry_training:0 "Ministry Inspired Training"
 LIT_ministry_training_desc:0 "Ministry inspired training will instill in those wayward ponies a true purpose, and a truer view of the world than any other misguided cretin could ever hope to achieve.

 LIT_lets_fuck_NAP:0 "Propose Invasion of New Appleloosa"
 LIT_lets_fuck_NAP_desc:0 "New Appleloosa stands to the west, as stubborn and prideful as ever. They seek to remain independent from the other Wasteland powers, but this will be their undoing.

 LIT_integrate_NAP:0 "Integrating New Appleloosa"
 LIT_integrate_NAP_desc:0 "New Appleloosa will find themselves, in due time, among the natural order of things.

 LIT_betrayed_by_MAS:0 "Betrayed by our Allies"
 LIT_betrayed_by_MAS_desc:0 "It hurts us to admit this, but perhaps we stood on the wrong side of history. The loyalty we demonstrated to the Ministry was not reciprocated. Despite all of our efforts and our undying loyalty, they stabbed us in the back. Who could have seen this coming? However, we do not have time to consider our mistakes. We must rally our ponies and prepare to take our revenge upon those who would so casually toss us away like trash."

 LIT_strong_to_resist:0 "Strong Enough to Resist"
 LIT_strong_to_resist_desc:0 "Though the Ministry shows us kindness and benevolence on the surface, we are no foals when it comes to their true motives.

 LIT_settlement_category_desc:0 "The Great City of Cloudsdale and its §GOutskirts§! have been sparesly populated ever since the city was blown out of the sky, but we intend to change that!\nThrough §Cincentives§!, §Opersuasion§! and §Rforced re-settlement§!, we will make sure this city lives up to its great past.\n\nOnce one of the §GOutskirts§! has reached a population of over §R4000§! it will become too dense for further settlement."

 LIT_settle_north:0 "Settle §CNorthern Outskirts§!"
 LIT_settle_north_desc:0 "The Northern Outskirts are perhaps the most pleasant of the outskirts, but also the most scarcely populated. Most settlements in the area are just simple farmsteads.

 LIT_settle_west:0 "Settle §OWestern Outskirts§!"

 LIT_event.1.t:0 "The Origin of Rainbows"
 LIT_event.1.d:0 "The Cloudsdale Weather Factory was once the cities pride and joy. It stood proud as one of the first major factories in all of Equestria, built well before even the return of Princess Luna. From clouds to rainbows, it produced all that was needed to maintain the skies across the nation. However, as the War progressed, the importance of the factory was brought into question. What use did rainbows have for the country? This would lead to a great debate among the Cloudsdale government regarding the future of their factory.\n\n The Equestrian Weather Union and the Pegasus Archival Society both pointed to it's importance, both then and historically. They heavily pushed not only for the factory to continue doing what it had always done, but to be expanded. This would prove to be a popular stance among the civilian population.\n\n The Ministry of Awesome would throw it's support behind an alternative plan to retool the factory to help produce aircraft for the war effort. According to their officials, every plane in the skies was another step closer to winning the war. This plan would rapidly gain popularity among the more patriotic of Equestria's citizenry.\n\n As an alternative to both plans, an infamous industrialist would instead purpose that a portion of the factory be refitted to manufacture useful products, which could then be used to aid the war effort. This plan would see the least support among the population, but enjoy some backing from various members of the Cloudsdale City Council.\n\n At the end of the day, it was decided to..."

 LIT_event.2.t:0 "The Day the Sky Fell"
 LIT_event.2.d:0 "On that day, two centuries ago, the entire world was blanketed in balefire. Millions perished, entire cities were reduced to little more than rubble, and the world was forever changed.\n\n One of the first major targets to be struck by the might of the megaspells was Cloudsdale. The city was crucial to the Equestrian war effort, being home to most pegasi of influence and power. As it fell out of the sky, hundreds of thousands of buildings breaking apart into nothingness, many pegasi sought to flee the city. The majority would flee to the skies, where they would reorganize and go on to found New Cloudsdale. However, a sizable amount of them instead turned towards the ground below, where they would go on to try to build their own society within the ruins of their former home.\n\n Shortly after the end of the world, refugees began to pour into the Cloudsdale area. Many of them were seeking refuge within the city, unaware of its fate, but they would only be met with small groups of pegasi trying to survive within the ruins. These refugees were..."
 LIT_event.2.a:0 "...embraced with open hooves."
 LIT_event.2.b:0 "...accepted, within reason."
 LIT_event.2.c:0 "...turned away."
 
 LIT_event.3.t:0 "The Beaked Menace"
 LIT_event.3.d:0 "Today, Featherbrush and his Talons seldom venture out of their bunker. Whether due to paranoia, guilt, or old age, Featherbrush has taken to a policy of isolationism towards the other forces of the Wasteland. However, this was not always the case.\n\n The name Featherbrush was once feared across the Wasteland. His band of mercenaries was known for their brutality and willingness to take any contract, with the griffon himself acting worse than most raiders. Countless settlements were razed to nothing, thousands of ponies were executed, and the sight of a griffon in the sky was enough to send entire towns into a panic. It was towards the end of this time that Featherbrush would claim Hill 432 as his new base of operations. One of his last acts of aggression would come in the form of securing the lands surrounding his new headquarters, which would bring about the Thunder-War.\n\n The Thunder-War was a quick offensive on the part of the Talons to push the ponies of the Lightning Scavengers out of the lands to the south of Hill 432. Unfortunately, we were near completely unprepared to deal with the attack, leading to our rapid defeat. However, in those brief moments when griffons could be spotted in the sky, those few soldiers on the border focused on..."

 LIT_event.4.t:0 "The Assembly of Tribes"
 LIT_event.4.d:0 "As our land has all of the different types of pony in equal measure, we have forged a government designed to represent all of them as best we can. Twice a year, the many settlements and villages across our land come together to vote on matters important to the whole. Usually, this is a relatively uneventful occurrence, with a bunch of old elders and local mayors trying to get more funding sent towards their little hamlets rather than towards anything more important. However, this session is already proving to be very different from the usual boring affair.\n\n Normally, the only ponies in attendance would be those representatives sent by their respective communities and maybe a small number of concerned citizens. This session was anything but normal though, as it also found itself being attended by a large number of ponies from the recently established Revanchist Coalition. Headed by Hook Hoof and Swift Storm themselves, this crowd filled the Assembly Hall. They, along with the ever-persistent Skybreaker, sought to challenge the status quo and send our nation on a new path. Today, the future of the Lightning Scavengers would be decided."
 LIT_event.4.a:0 "Shake Spar takes the stage..."
 LIT_event.4.b:0 "§RSkip the flavor events.§!"
 
 LIT_event.41.t:0 "Shake Spar Opens"
 LIT_event.41.d:0 "'Friends, I welcome you to the Assembly of Tribes. It is within this hallowed Hall that we have decided upon our future for generations, as we shall for generations more. As you know, the Assembly Hall was built by Lightwing, who saw the need for proper representative governance within our land. It is from her wisdom and grace that the Assembly was founded, and it is her vision which we have followed for all these years. Let me remind you all of her words in her parting address, that 'a pony can not move without all of its hooves working in unison.' Those words stand as true today as they did then. Without unity, without all of us coming together and putting our difference aside, we will fall flat upon our muzzles.\n\n Now I know there are some here today who seek to steer us away from our course. To set us down a brand new path, one wrought with violence and danger. Though I admire the fire in these ponies hearts, I would be a foal if I did not point out that down their purposed paths lies little more than ruin. They make many promises, from reclaiming our lands to restoring our pride. Yet those methods which they advocate for, to turn our backs on all that has gotten us this far, would surely destroy us far quicker than any raider gang could.\n\n So I plead with you all to make the right choice today. We can and will prosper as one united people, if you would all just continue to put your faith and trust in me. Thank you.'"
 LIT_event.41.a:0 "Skybreaker steps up..."
 
 LIT_event.42.t:0 "Skybreaker Speaks"
 LIT_event.42.d:0 "'Hello everpony! You all already know me, Skybreaker of Lightning Point. It is there that I grew up, and it is there that I first beheld the splendors of magic.'\n\n A quiet grumbling could be heard across the crowd, who seemed just as disinterested in Skybreaker's ideas as they had for each and every Assembly before this. The stallion himself glanced around nervously, before changing tone completely.\n\n 'Do you all not see the danger we are in!? Our neighbors are bloodthirsty, their weapons sharp, and their guns ready! If we do not take action, and take it now, we shall be doomed to become nothing more than a pile of gory remains!'\n\n The unexpected vigor was quick to grab the audiences attention, and every eye was now focused intently on the pony before them.\n\n 'Speaker Shake Spar says we can just continue on as we always have, as if we could just ignore the world around us. Look around! You don't even have to go beyond our own borders to find our enemies, ponies who would destroy our very way of life. If you would just give me a chance, just let me put my ideas into practice, you will see that all of our problems could be solved with ease. Just give me the chance to fix everything and you'll see miracles made real.'"
 LIT_event.42.a:0 "Hook Hoof emerges..."
 
 LIT_event.43.t:0 "Hook Hoof's Grand Promises"
 LIT_event.43.d:0 "'Howdy. Now, wasn't that cute? I had no idea little Skybreaker had so much passion within him. If only he half as much brains, he would see that we aren't his enemies. Let me ask you all, where has the oh so wise and benevolent leadership of Shake gotten us so far? Did it avenge the Thunder-War? Did it prevent our ponies from turning on one another, leaving our nation broken and divided? It seems not, otherwise I wouldn't be up here today.\n\n I can tell you with full confidence that I can avenge the Thunder-War within a year. Hell, I could unify all of Appleloosa within just a few years! Just give me the reins and let me do what I do best, and you'll be amazed to see how much our nation could prosper. Our fear of griffons will become nothing but a distant faded memory, and I'll make sure that we stand as the strongest nation this side of the Azureway! So, what do you folks say? Want to forge a better future?'"
 LIT_event.43.a:0 "Swift Storm, surrounded by supporters, joins Hook Hoof on stage..."
 
 LIT_event.44.t:0 "Swift Storm's Rallying Speech"
 LIT_event.44.d:0 "Stepping next to Hook Hoof, Swift Storm began to speak. 'Yes, for it is that future that we all dream! One of prosperity, of might, and of a better world for us all! What better goal could we hope to aspire to than that of improving the quality of life for our ponies, and our ponies alone? Come now, my brothers and sisters, come and join us in this just cause! For the future shall be bright, with our nation shining even brighter as a beacon of greatness across the entirity of the Wasteland! Who will stand with us, who will show the bravery and courage necessary to step hoof on a new path towards a greater world?'\n\n The ponies surrounding him, notably all pegasi, cheered at his words. As did many of the pegasi representatives present at the Assembly, though representatives from other tribes were far more subdued. \n\n 'Now, we shall leave you all with a choice. What will you choose? A future of stagnation, with nothing in store for us but a slow and terrible death? A future of uncertainty, turning to magic and technology in a desperate attempt to ward off our enemies? Or will you choose a better future, one where everypega- everypony will live happy and carefree, without having to worry about the horrors of the Wasteland? The choice is up to you."
 LIT_event.44.a:0 "The Assembly talks among themselves."
 
 LIT_event.45.t:0 "The Assembly's Decision"
 LIT_event.45.d:0 "The many representatives from all across the Lightning Scavengers argued and debated with one another for hours, testing the merit of the radical new ideas being proposed. Shake Spar merely watched as all this went on, confident that they would see sense at the end of the day. After all, he knew that everypony present was as stubborn as a mule, and that they would never give up the old traditions.\n\n However, the situation was nowhere near as certain as he had hoped. Already, a concerning number of representatives were throwing their support behind the Revanchists, falling for their promises of restoring the Lightning Scavenger's pride. Even more concerningly, many of the older and more conservative members of the Assembly were discussing the merit of giving that upstart, Skybreaker, a chance. As the hours dragged on, it became clear that the Assembly would not be unified behind any one canidate.\n\n Finally, the matter was called to vote. With a simple show of hooves, the Assembly decided that the Speaker would be..."

 LIT_event.45.c:0 "The Revanchists, with their promise of better days."
 
 
 LIT_event.5.t:0 "The New Administration"
 LIT_event.5.d:0 "Ever since the failed war against the Ministry, the Lightning Scavengers have existed in a state of complete disarray. The Assembly had devolved to little more than a game of shouting between those few representatives who still attended, with the majority of settlements and tribes having withdrawn from the institution altogether. The future seemed bleak, and an overall sense of dread hung in the air across the land.\n\n Today, all of that changed. A decree has been sent out across the land from Minister [MAS.GetName], granting recognition to the limited autonomy of the Lightning Scavengers. This new autonomous government will be lead by none other than Skybreaker, who has been an outspoken advocate of working with our new occupiers since they first marched into our lands.\n\n Many ponies see working with our enemies to be a betrayal of all of our ideals, but Skybreaker insists that it is for the best that we get along with our new benevolent patrons. As disagreeable as that idea may be, we are unfortunately left with little choice at the present time."
 LIT_event.5.a:0 "Nothing to be done about it"
 
 LIT_event.6.t:0 "The Tables Have Turned"
 LIT_event.6.d:0 "Today, a call for celebration has gone out across the land. [ROOT.GetLeader] has even decreed a national holidy to celebrate our glorious victory against the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. We lived in fear of them, both due to their unknown nature and the threat they posed to us. Now though, we are finally free of that fear and uncertainty. With their ominous presence removed from the Wasteland, our existence has been secured for yet another day.\n\n As for their lair of dread, Stable 49, it has been brought under our firm hoof. Those who resisted integration into our nation have been dealt with, though they were thankfully few in number. The majority of the Ministry's former population has proven willing to cooperate with us, so long as we prove willing to continue to allow them to live as they always have.\n\n Already, this cooperation has born fruit, as many of the Ministry's top scientists have become our own. Their expertise will prove useful in the years to come."
 LIT_event.6.a:0 "A relic of a bygone age put to rest."
 
 LIT_event.7.t:0 "A Message from the Weather Factory"
 LIT_event.7.d:0 "The tribals and scavengers to the south have surprised us with a diplomatic envoy today. It seems that they have grown tired of the barbarism and brutality of the Wasteland, instead seeking the patronage of a more civilized and proper society to lead them forward into the future. And what society could be more civilized than us? With our advanced technology, vast understanding of the arcane, and sophisticated ways, we are the natural pick for any nation looking for a saviour.\n\n Their diplomat, a surprisingly sharply dressed and well-spoken young stallion by the name of Skybreaker, has spoken to us of a brighter future for both our nations. One where his backwards ponies can seek true enlightenment, being uplifted and turned into something greater. At the same time, we would benefit from having a great deal of control over their nation, and all the benefits that would bring. To sweeten the deal even further, he has offered us land as well.\n\n Though some wonder if we should be so willing to work with a Wastelander, especially one who promises so much. Many within our ranks warn that this deal is far too good to be true, and that we can not trust this stallion to uphold his word on anything. However, the choice of whether or not to accept this offer is ultimaely up to [ROOT.GetLeader]."
 LIT_event.7.a:0 "They shall be uplifted!"
 LIT_event.7.b:0 "Work with a filthy Wastelander? Never!"
 
 LIT_event.8.t:0 "Our New Patron"
 LIT_event.8.d:0 "Skybreaker returned to his home and makeshift office within Lightning Point for what would be the last time. He would be soon moving all of his belongings to his new home to the south, and his hometown would find itself turned over to the Ministry. He couldn't help but to feel a small stab of sorrow at the thought, as there was little telling how his quaint home would find itself transformed under the rule of his new patrons.\n\n Putting such sad thoughts aside, he turned to signing off on the last of the missives to be sent out. There was little time to waste on sentimentalism when there was so much work to be done. Each and every tribe and town had to be made aware of the new arrangement that they would now enjoy with their wise and benevolent Ministrial overlords, and all dissenting voices had to be addressed or otherwise dealt with. The future was a bright one, but there was still a long ways to go to reach it."

 LIT_event.9.t:0 "Skybreaker's Failure"
 LIT_event.9.d:0 "Skybreaker's desk was a mess, overfilling with both letters and his own hastily scribbled ideas. Sure, the Ministry refused to grant him their backing, but surely the situation could still be salvaged. A different patron could be found, a different path of upliftment could be established. [RED.GetLeader], maybe? Or perhaps the Steel Rangers. Yes, the Steel Rangers could be trusted! And they had power armour!\n\n His panicked and rapid thoughts were brought to a halt by a pounding on his door. Eyes wide in fear, Skybreaker did little more than stare. The pounding grew in intensity, inciting the stallion to cower under his desk, which is where he would remain as his rather pitiful old door was torn off its ancient hinges.\n\n A group of armed soldiers made their way into the room, briefly scanning it before spotting the pony they were here for. One of them, a particularly burly stallion that brought thoughts of danger to Skybreaker's mind, stepped forward and began to shout at his prone form.\n\n 'Former Speaker Skybreaker! As per the ruling of the Assembly, and with the approval of Speaker Shake Spar, you are to be arrested for treason against our nation! We ask that you come quietly to face justice.'\n\n Skybreaker did not move a muscle, still trying to process how it had all gone so wrong. The soldiers only gave him a few moments before forcefully dragging him out from under his desk and out the door."

 LIT_event.10.d:0 "It's so hard to find able-bodied servants nowadays. Thankfully, our faithful allies to the south have proven more than willing to provide their own ponies. All they ask in exchange is some simplistic technology, that which is already mundane and everyday to us. To see their ignorant faces light up in awe as they behold our most basic luxuries is truly an exeprience, one which both reminds us of just how far above these ponies we are and how we are doing a great thing by uplifting them. Perhaps some day they will even understand the joys of lightswitches and running water. For now though, they merely wish to understand the inner mechanisms of guns and automations, as would be expected of Wastelanders like them."

 LIT_event.11.t:0 "One in a Million"
 LIT_event.11.d:0 "Over the past two centuries, the ruins of Cloudsdale have been picked clean of most things of value. Unfortunately for us, there was little value to be found in the seemingly endless number of fallen aircraft that dotted the land. Many of them actively leaked radiation, creating a hazard for anypony brave enough to pick through them, and few had any hope of ever being restored to functionality. As a result, they often went overlooked by all but the most tenacious of scavengers.\n\n However, it would seem that perhaps we were overly dismissive of such wreckage. Today, under a short layer of rubble, a young scavenger came across a remarkable find: An almost fully intact cloudship, one of truly immense proportions. Unfortunately, it's cloud generators are shot to the point that it will has no hope of ever flying again.\n\n0 Despite this, it still holds great value for us, both in the vast usable materials that could come of it and the great insight we could have into the inner workings of Equestria's greatest war machines. What should we do with this flying titan?"

 LIT_event.12.d:0 "It would seem that the Lightning Scavengers are growing more amibitious under our rule. They seek to wage war against the settlement of 'New Appleloosa', and are asking for our permission to do so. Normally, we wouldn't care much about a bunch of Wastelanders killing another bunch of Wastelanders, except it seems that this settlement is a trading hub for the south and held in generally high regard by much of the Wasteland. We would rather not attract the ire of a horde of barbarians, if we can at all help it.\n\n On the other hoof, we would also stand to benefit from this conquest. We could always use more land and resources to help fuel our efforts. \n\n There's also the matter of how the Lightning Scavengers would react. It may sour relations if we were to turn down their request, though we're certain they would get over it soon enough. After all, they've proven reasonable and rational enough to see the wisdom in our rulership.\n\n So, shall we grant them our approval?"

 LIT_event.14.d:0 "Staring at the letter under in hoof, Skybreaker went through a variety of emotions in rapid succession. First, surprise turned shock at the rejection. Second, desperation. Surely if he only kept reading, it would turn out that this was a joke. Surely, [MAS.GetLeader] was just playing a prank on him. Finally, anger.\n\n The poor guards outside Skybreaker's office was the only one beholden to his angry ranting. 'Do they think this is a joke? Do they not see the necessity, the importance of this to the entire plan!? No, how can they, how can they. The blind fools, so blinded by their own height that they can not see the ground below. They are no better - no better! - than the pegasi who locked themselves away above the clouds. They care not for us, for our greatness, for the plan! This will not stand! If they seek to ruin all of my plans, to ruin my future, then I shall ruin them in kind! Guards, guards, send out the word! Prepare everypony! The time of our liberation is nigh!'"

However, there is a teensy tiny holdup... \n\n It seems that the Lightning Scavengers are under the misguided impression that they conquered New Appleloosa for themselves, rather than for us. They have even gone so far as to issue a statement of cooperation with our plan to transition the land and resources over to them in a timely fashion, as if there were no other alternative. Of course, we are hesitant to give up anything to them. After all, was it not by our hooves that New Appleloosa fell?

 LIT_event.16.d:0 "Skybreaker stood proudly before the gathered crowd, the banners of the Ministry flying proudly to either side of him. This was truly a great day, one that would go down in history as the day of salvation for the Lightning Scavengers. What was once a loose coalition had evolved into something so much grander, uplifted by their betters to join a more civilized world. At the impatient glares of the Ministry's representatives, Skybreaker stepped forward and began his speech.\n\n 'Hello, my ponies. For years, you have suffered and died in this cruel harsh world. A world devoid of even the smallest ounce of hope and rife with endless amounts of danger. Now, we have ascended beyond that. We have left behind the burdens of the wastes, and have instead embraced the beacon of civilization! Thanks to the support and backing of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences, we have been allowed to go beyond our primitive selves and become something far greater! And today, I am proud to announce that we shall be taking that one final step on this long plan towards a better future: We shall be joining the Ministry, in all ways. All ponies of this great nation are to become ponies of the Ministry, for we are all one unified nation!'\n\n This brought about limited cheering from the assembled crowd, with a distinct lack of enthusiasm in the air. The Ministry's attending personnel were quick to take note of this, scowls developing on several of their faces. However, it didn't matter if these ponies loved them. All they had to do was accept their rule."

The contents of it were anything but pleasant, as it seems our once faithful subject has grown far more confident than is healthy. They have demanded that we return their northern territories, with the threat of war should we refuse. Who do they think they are? A band of filthy disgusting Wastelanders, incapable of understanding the mechanisms of even a simple lightswitch without our guidance! However, we can not deny that even a village idiot may be rendered deadly should they have a gun in their hooves. Are the lives we would lose worth putting these upstarts in their place, or should we simply concede to their demand?"

 LIT_event.19.d:0 "Today, a rather odd envoy arrived from the lands to the west. The envoy consisted of not just one, but rather two different ponies. One, an earth pony. The other, a pegasus. They spent nearly as much time arguing with eachother as they did trying to convince us of their proposal, with no less than three hoof fights breaking out between the two diplomats over the course of their meeting with [ROOT.GetLeader].\n\n Though the fine details were lost in the brawling and bickering, it seems that the Lightning Scavengers are now seeking an alliance with us. They have often been our foe throughout history, making this a highly unexpected proposal. However, it seems that they believe we can leave all of our problems in the past and come together to appreciate what truly matters: hating griffons. Together, we can drive the birdbrains out of the lands to the north, putting an end to the threat they pose to the region once and for all.\n\n Should we accept this offer, or leave them to their own affairs?"

Smoke fills the strees across the nation, as the fighting continues to escalate. Hook Hoof has already fortified his position within the Crooked Bloatsprite, from which he coordinates his side. Though he would normally be hideously outnumbered, he has found his forces bolstered greatly by ponies who simply wish to oppose Swift Storm's pro-pegasi policies.\n\n Meanwhile, Swift Storm has rallied pegasi all across the nation to his side. His forces firmly hold the skies, often launching surprise assaults on the ponies down below. A large force was already being gathered to deal with Hook Hoof directly and a final confrontation between the two sides has been made inevitable."
