### Opening Focuses ###
 
 LIT_Starting_Focus:0 "The Weather Factory"
 LIT_Starting_Focus_desc:0 "The Weather Factory was once the pride and joy of Cloudsdale. Before the war, the Factory regulated and manufactured Equestria's weather patterns, keeping the seasons in order. Now, it is nothing more than a shadow of its former self within the ruins of a once-great city."
 
 LIT_Starting_Focus_2:0 "The Fall of Cloudsdale"
 LIT_Starting_Focus_2_desc:0 "Cloudsdale was one of the first hit by the megaspells. Those who survived the blasts and didn't follow the Enclave on still skulk within the ruins. Hope drives them forward, towards what would hopefully be a brighter future. One that would be good for all the little ponies of the wasteland."
 
 LIT_Starting_Focus_3:0 "The Thunder-War"
 LIT_Starting_Focus_3_desc:0 "The Thunder-War was a humiliating defeat suffered at the dirty claws of the Featherbrushes Talons. They had been a menance that to us ever since. If we were to do nothing except wallow in our humiliation without addressing our shortcomings, then we would only taste defeat once more. This is unacceptable."
 
 LIT_assembly_is_called:0 "The Assembly is Called"
 LIT_assembly_is_called_desc:0 "The Assembly of Tribes has always been what elevated us above the neighbours that surround us. Semi-annually, the semi-autonomous tribal villages that are unified under one banner convene together to elect a Leader, representing the Three Pony Tribes. We must hold onto this ideal and to keep on in the face of adversity."
 
 
 ### Industry ###
 
 LIT_economic_matters:0 "Economic Matters"
 LIT_economic_matters_desc:0 "Our economy suffer from many woes and difficulties. It would be prudent for us to address our economic situation so that we can make our little corner of Old Equestria just a little bit more prosperous, a little more bountiful to the ponies that live here."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale:0 "Prepare Cloudsdale for Reconstruction"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_desc:0 "The Pegasi that once lived around the remains of their ancestral home in the Cloudsdale Ruins formed the foundation of our system, now it is time for us to return that favour. We can help rebuild. It will be difficult, but it will also be worth it."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_infrastructure:0 "Infrastructure around Cloudsdale"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_infrastructure_desc:0 "The infrastructure we have around Cloudsdale is a joke. What little we have are loosely cobbled-together structures always at risk of collapse and always vulnerable to attacks from ghouls or other scavengers. It is time to make sure we live in better conditions."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_scavenge:0 "Scavenge what can't be repaired"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_scavenge_desc:0 "Yes, there are plenty of things that can't be repaired. But the wonders of the Old World are plentiful and there for us to take. What could be replaced should be replaced. It is clear that this could never go wrong in any way, shape, or form."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_cloudship:0 "A Magnificient Find"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_cloudship_desc:0 "We have managed to find something magnificent! A cloudship was discovered in our searches through the ruins and now, perhaps we will have the opportunity to improve upon our situations with this new opportunity."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_settling:0 "Begin settling the outskirts"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_settling_desc:0 "The outskirts have always been quite close to being empty and desolate, but this will not do. If we fail to use our territory effectively, then we would only leave ourselves vulnerable to our neighbours. We must settle those outermost peripheries."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_factories:0 "Repair some of the Cloud-factories"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_factories_desc:0 "Our repeated attempts at reshaping the Cloudsdale Ruins bore fruit. Now, there is an unprecedent opportunity for us to repair those old, defunct cloud-factories so that, once more, Cloudsdale's old glories could be restored."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_finish:0 "A Proud City once More!"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_finish_desc:0 "Finally, Cloudsdale can stand amongst the proud cities of the Equestrian Wasteland once more. It's not what it once was, to be sure. Far from it. But now we can at least point to our shining city in the Wasteland and say its name with pride."
 
 LIT_country_whole:0 "Our Country as a Whole..."
 LIT_country_whole_desc:0 "Though Cloudsdale has once again become a Great and Powerful industrial Centre, our country can't build off of Cloudsdale alone, no matter how much we would wish for it to be so. The hinterlands and the isolated settlements that make up the rest of our territory need to be developed with just as much care."
 
 LIT_country_streets:0 "Build Streets between Settlements"
 LIT_country_streets_desc:0 "There are few streets that connects our settlements. It would be nice if the ponies could finally enjoy paved roads again. Our roadworks project will surely reduce travel time and set the ground for more ambitious construction projects down the line."
 
 LIT_country_power:0 "Our Own Electricity"
 LIT_country_power_desc:0 "It is paramount that we are energy-sufficient. What little we can do to make our little piece of the Wasteland be filled with electric lights and all the splendors of the old world will surely motivate our people to believe in our ideals with stronger conviction."
 
 LIT_country_enterprise:0 "Encourage private Enterprise"
 LIT_country_enterprise_desc:0 "Small businesses are setting up shops here, the caravans came and unloaded their weary wagons of goods here. Perhaps all of those are good, positive actions that need to be encouraged. Give them some room trade and sell."
 
 LIT_country_clearance:0 "Wide-Scale Land Clearance"
 LIT_country_clearance_desc:0 "The end of Old Equestria gave way for nature to take control of much our land and left our cities enveloped within dense forestry and populated by little critters. The rubble, and those wasteland environments must be cleared away and reshaped to better accomodate our little ponies. Comfortable living will be our ultimate goal."
 
 LIT_country_closer:0 "Closer together now"
 LIT_country_closer_desc:0 "It is fair to say that our little, scrappy piece of the wasteland become the start of something beautiful. The hustle and bustle of trade and growing communities that are now more and more interconnected thanks to our roads renewed our bonds with each other. What was once just a loose connection of wastelanders struggling to survive now feel connected to a national purpose and a greater community."
 
 LIT_country_finish:0 "A Modern Wasteland Nation"
 LIT_country_finish_desc:0 "Hurrah! Three cheers for the hard work that we've done thus far, for now we can finally call ourselves a true model for the Wasteland to follow. Surely those who subsist upon the scraps tossed aside by those slavers will see our progress as a beacon of hope."
 
 LIT_apple_ambition:0 "Appleloosan Ambitions"
 LIT_apple_ambition_desc:0 "Now that we have industrialized and modernised sufficiently, it is time that we carry the torch of progress to the rest of the Appleloosan region. How can we be comfortable, knowing our neighbours are starving, impoverished, and in need of upliftment? It betrays every one of our treasured ideals to not help!"
 
 LIT_OAP_railroad:0 "South-Appleloosan Railroads"
 LIT_OAP_railroad_desc:0 "The new proposed ideas for the railroads had been met with skepticism in the past, after all, much of what remained of the old railroad hubs had been taken and reappropriated by slavers and raiders. But now with us as a beacon of hope in the Appleloosan region, perhaps we can build those railways again connect us fellow ponies closer together."
 
 LIT_lichenfield_glass:0 "Lichenfield Glass Factory"
 LIT_lichenfield_glass_desc:0 "The Lichenfield Glass Factory was an ambitious idea, to be sure, but one that will be necessary in order for us to properly rebuild as a nation. After all, the bombs had shattered the windows of many a fine buildings. Perhaps if we could repair some of those buildings and begin the start of something beautiful with the Glass Factory."
 
 LIT_OAP_solar:0 "Desert Solar-Farms"
 LIT_OAP_solar_desc:0 "It many seem ridiculius to many that we are developing alternative methods of energy harvesting in the wasteland. We were not builders, but rather scavengers for much of our past. It is an uncomfortable truth, but all of our projects have culminated in this idea of leaving something behind in the wasteland, and improving upon it. We will build the Solar-Farms so that no pony will feel cold in the winter again!"
 
 LIT_OAP_gun_foundries:0 "Nationalize Ranger Gun-Foundries"
 LIT_OAP_gun_foundries_desc:0 "The Gun-Foundries are an integral part of our military apparatus, we cannot leave them in the hands of private interests, and so they must be placed under the supervision of our direct administration. It is high time that our forces have guns they could count upon, created for them by us."
 
 LIT_NAP_integration:0 "North-Appleloosan Trade-Cooperation"
 LIT_NAP_integration_desc:0 "The NATC will be a thing of beauty, a true testament to inter-regional harmony and cooperation. When the trade flows so freely, all of our little ponies will prosper. Our continued nation-building efforts have once again proven that we are the beacon of hope in this blighted land."
 
 LIT_NAP_settle_artisans:0 "Appropriate Appleloosan Artisans"
 LIT_NAP_settle_artisans_desc:0 "Our artisans are the best in Appleloosa, and perhaps the best in all the land! But we need to make sure those who had come to settle here could truly provide value to us. We must always prioritise how their talents could contribute to the great effort to rebuild, after all."
 
 LIT_NAP_monopolies:0 "Monopolize Appleloosan Trade"
 LIT_NAP_monopolies_desc:0 "We are the dominant trading power in the region, we hold control that no other powers before us save Old Equestria could claim. Celestia Herself would surely be proud of what we have done with this place. It is only rational, then, that we allow for no other competitors. They cannot be better than us, after all. So why let them even try?"
 
 LIT_NAP_precision_manufacturing:0 "Invest in Precision-Manufacturing"
 LIT_NAP_precision_manufacturing_desc:0 "Precision-Manufacturing, centuries ago, led to the Appleloosan region flourishing with well-produced equipment and fine products. We would do well to remember the lessons of the past and apply them to the present, so that we may have a better future."
 
 LIT_ROK_ports:0 "The Ports of Hoof City"
 LIT_ROK_ports_desc:0 "Hoof City has continued to be a trade hub for all those who still have the capability of conducting maritime trade and a centre for naval construction. It would be in our interests to develop them so that we could once again see the sea from coast to coast."
 
 LIT_ROK_moar_rocks:0 "Increase Rock Production"
 LIT_ROK_moar_rocks_desc:0 "The Rock Farms of the past had not survived well after the mega-spells caused the collpase of our civilisation, they were chronically under-producing and often in a state of disrepair. There are several options outlined to increase rock production so that we may have the ability to set more and more ambitious quotas in the future."
 
 LIT_ROK_east_settlement:0 "Settle East Appleloosa"
 LIT_ROK_east_settlement_desc:0 "East Appleloosa are filled with critters and a somewhat hostile environment that had led to it being less settled than the other regions of Appleloosa. The overabundance of raiders and slavers that called this plaxce home deterred many from settling down here. It is high time we rectified this by encouraging more emigration through monetary incentives and local benefits."
 
 LIT_ROK_composites:0 "Subsidize Composite Production"
 LIT_ROK_composites_desc:0 "We have truly become an industralised powerhouse in the region, but we must not be satisfied with just this. We could do more, and our ambitions are chafing at the edges of what we are realistically capable of, so it is only logical that we offer subsidies to incentivise even more growth. To reach higher than we have in the past, and to create more jobs, our little ponies will surely thank us for this undertaking."
 
 LIT_dream_fulfilled:0 "The Dream, Fulfilled!"
 LIT_dream_fulfilled_desc:0 "It has been a long journey of industrialisation but our hard work has bore us fruit. We stand tall in the bright sunny south, in peace and content. We will defend our vision, and perhaps share this once and future dream with of Equestria."
 
 ###Emergency###
 
 LIT_emergency1:0 "Emergency Mobilization"
 LIT_emergency1_desc:0 "The Ministry of Arcane Science had seen fit to disturb the fragile peace of the region by way of war. This is unacceptable, they seem to be under the impression that we would be nothing but pushovers. They are wrong. To arms! We shall defend our home to the last mare standing!"
 
 LIT_emergency2:0 "Confiscate Civillian Arms"
 LIT_emergency2_desc:0 "The war has developed not necessarily in a way that is conductive to the betterment of our wonderful economy. We must ask for our civilians to support our troops at the front by relinquishing their old weaponry, however hard this may come to our populace. Our home must be defended the Old Ministry's belligerence, and we need more guns."
 
 LIT_emergency3:0 "Everypony to the Front!"
 LIT_emergency3_desc:0 "To the Front! Your home must be defended! How can we beat back the barbarous Ministry at the door if we lack soldiers? Our land will not be sacrificed, and we shall not budge from our positions. Ponies, we need you there at frontlines! We shall overcome them with our numbers and liberate them from the tyrannies imposed upon them by their Overpony."
 
 LIT_emergency4:0 "Prepare a Fallback-Line"
 LIT_emergency4_desc:0 "The war situation has developed perhaps not necessarily to our advantage. It has become a necessity to fall back to a more defensible position to excise their poison and hold fast. We have to begin construction of a new Fallback-Line. Only then will we have of ever mounting a counter-attack."
 
 LIT_emergency5:0 "Our Last Stand"
 LIT_emergency5_desc:0 "Is this the end of the line for us? No! We shall never surrender to the likes of them, nor shall we capitulate their own foolish and short-sighted whims. Our ideals have held us together for so long, it shall not betray us now. Behind every city, every town, every street, and every house there shall be us. We will not give them the satisfaction of being docile subjects in our last days! We will take our stand!"
 
 
 ###Military###
 
 LIT_reform_armed_forces:0 "Reforming our Meager Forces"
 LIT_reform_armed_forces_desc:0 "It has been an inescapable reality for much of our history that what pathetic remains of our 'military' would not be able to compete with any of our much stronger neighbours. If we continue to be complacent in the face of danger, then we are only inviting another humiliating defeat like the Thunder War. Reforms must be implemented."
 
 LIT_spec_ops_focus:0 "Focus on Special Forces"
 LIT_spec_ops_focus_desc:0 "Our Special Forces have not always been able to be trained up to the standard that was expected of them. In order to prepare against any invasion by our neighbour, we must have reliable and elite units at the ready to fight harder than the average pony troops. Therefore, we must prioritise training up the best of the best, no matter the cost."
 
 LIT_united_in_service:0 "United in Service"
 LIT_united_in_service_desc:0 "United forever, in friendship and service. Our mighty forces will endure against the hardest challenges and survive through even the darkest days and the stormiest nights! Long live our ideals! The wasteland will never extinguish our free and unified ideals. As ponies, we stand together in diversity, against hate and slavery. Our names will bre echoed through history, for we are stronger together."
 
 LIT_anti_tank:0 "Steelcrackers"
 LIT_anti_tank_desc:0 "Our latest technological innovations will surely destroy even the mightiest invaders at our doorstep. Those so-called 'anti-tank weaponry' are perfect for our purposes against the enemies who wish to mobilise any sort of mechanised forces against us. Our top researchers have already been struggling night and day to find ways to better integrate those new measures into our existing forces. We pray to Celestia that they will be enough."
 
 LIT_spec_doctrine:0 "Our Specialized Doctrine"
 LIT_spec_doctrine_desc:0 "In the face of insurmountable odds, we must still be prepared. No matter what the world may choose to throw at us, we can be reassured by our general staff's new ideas on how we may overcome those struggles. Already, there have been echoes of reforming our chain of command to adhere to either the war doctrines or to use the doctrines perfected through bloodied fighting in the wasteland. In the end, we can only hope we have a right choice."
 
 LIT_value_mobility:0 "The Value of Mobility"
 LIT_value_mobility_desc:0 "Speed have always held a special place in our hearts. No matter how dangerous their weapons, if we can evade their attacks, then we will always remain unscathed. For mobility will give us greater manuevarbility in this blasted hellscape. All we can hope for is to best them by tactics or by speed, even if we must fight against a greater power than we."
 
 LIT_PA_research:0 "Power-Armor Research"
 LIT_PA_research_desc:0 "The most beautiful and terrifying symbol of Old Equestria was their Power-Armor soldiers, which remain as the undisputed kings of the battlefield, regardless of theatre or terrain. We must hasten our research in resotring those old glories so that we too can claim dominance over our foes. They will be in for a bitter surprise if they see us as just a docile stepping stone to future greatness."
 
 LIT_mass_inf_focus:0 "Focus on Massed Infantry"
 LIT_mass_inf_focus_desc:0 "Numbers will overcome any deficit or shortcomings that still remain in our military forces. So long as our soldiers have the will and are willing to risk it all for our great ideals, then victory would only be inevitable. We will seize the day, in the face of such overwhelming danger there will be countless ponies eager to join up with us to fight. On-hooves, we will be unparalleled."
 
 LIT_chems_research:0 "Increase Chem-Production"
 LIT_chems_research_desc:0 "We shall produce more chems so that our ponies will not falter on the battlefield and be ready fight for another day. It may be a drastic measure to relentlessly increase production, but we will be able to fulfil those new quotas. It is certain that greater ambitions could not be caged by timidness and a hesitation to place more funding into our military. There can never be enough bottlecaps invested in our soldiers!"
 
 LIT_universal_doctrine:0 "Doctrine-Research"
 LIT_universal_doctrine_desc:0 "We will continue in our research for the greater understanding of how to prosecute wars in the modern day. It was clear that no matter what it was, we can always improve upon the foundations that we built so that our home will be secured against those horrid forces that dare amass outside our borders. It is clear, our path forward are no longer shrouded in fear and uncertainty."
 
 LIT_virtue_bravery:0 "The Virtue of Bravery"
 LIT_virtue_bravery_desc:0 "The outsiders are not like us, we are the only ones truly capable of bravery and good virtuous discipline in this wasteland. Our rise to greatness was inevitable, and this understanding must be reinforced on every level within our soldiers and officer corps. They must not give in to fear and be ever-resilient, not matter what it is they face. We plant our hooves in the ground, and will not take even a single step back."
 
 LIT_grenades_for_all:0 "Grenades for Everypony!"
 LIT_grenades_for_all_desc:0 "Grenades are the future of our mighty initiative. It has been clear from the very beginning how useful incendiaries can be. You get a grenade! You get a grenade! Check under your seats and you will find more grenades there! Everyone get grenades! The time for fun explosions have come, and we shall bring them to the battlefield with joy in our hearts and a spring in our hoof-steps."
 
 LIT_gun_research:0 "Military Research Initiative"
 LIT_gun_research_desc:0 "Our Military Research Initiatives requests ever more funding, and we are more than happy to comply with their every demand. We cannot risk falling behind our rivals and neighbours lest they see as weak and ripe for the picking. As we progress further in our technological research and innovate where they have failed, we will remain triumphant. Our arsenals will be stocked with only the most advanced and powerful weaponry for our fine soldiers."
 
 LIT_illustrious_elite:0 "The illustrious Elite"
 LIT_illustrious_elite_desc:0 "The elites have always supported our many plans, our greates amibitions, and was there even in our most humiliating elite. The time has come for us to reward them for their steadfast nature by allowing them a bigger share of the military and for them to contribute to our efforts by placing them as a part of our process of reforming the military. They shall join, and they shall be grateful for the privilege of doing so."
 
 LIT_more_bodies_bullets:0 "More bodies than Bullets"
 LIT_more_bodies_bullets_desc:0 "The soldiers we have are not enough to satisfy the basic requirements drafted up by our War Committee, it is clear to us that we require more and more societal participation in our armed forces or else we will be vulnerable to the outsiders. We must never show even a moment of weakness against those who conspire against us."
 
 LIT_airforce_1:0 "Foundations of an Airforce"
 LIT_airforce_1_desc:0 "We may not have much of what most would call an 'airforce' but we have the capacity to create one, to be sure. Our strong industrial base and connection to the skies have given us more than enough of a headstart compared to our neighbours in terms what we can do in terms of aerial combat. We would do well to expand upon the foundations here and truly create a terrifying and 'awesome' force in the skies that our enemies shall never look up to the skies without feeling fear."
 
 LIT_airforce_2:0 "Fighter Development"
 LIT_airforce_2_desc:0 "The development of fighter planes have come at a steady and acceptable pace. We are more than ready to integrate them into our newly created airforce at this point in time."
 
 LIT_airforce_3:0 "Attack-Plane Development"
 LIT_airforce_3_desc:0 "The continued development of Attack-Planes have been a boon for our now-formidable air force. Though we have been progressing along these lines quite nicely for a while now, it is easy to see that our continued research into aerial efforts will ensure that we remain unchallenged and unmatched. Those foolish Enclave Pegasi will regret cutting thoselves off from Equestria."
 
 LIT_airforce_4:0 "Aerial Doctrines"
 LIT_airforce_4_desc:0 "The aerial doctrines we have available before us give us many oppotunities to refine our ability to engage in combat high above the clouds and to wage war on land. After all, if no other airforce could challenge us in the sky, how could they ever hope to beat our little ponies on the battle on land?"
 
 LIT_airforce_5:0 "Construct Airship-Yards"
 LIT_airforce_5_desc:0 "The Airship-Yards of Old Equestria have since became useless and impossible to repair. If we are to climb to ever higher heights of greatness, then we must construct newer Airship-Yards fit-for-purpose. Our hope as ponies will rest in our capacity to maintain a great formidable military force. Let's hope it will forever be terrifying and majestic in the eyes of our enemies."
 
 LIT_navy_1:0 "Countruct Dockyards"
 LIT_navy_1_desc:0 "Naval capabilities werre an oft-neglected aspect of our military as the old tri-service arrangement fell to the wayside as the old Equestrian Navy was left unsalvageable by us and too distant an ambition to seriously consider. But now we must have some hope of building a small force that could one day become something greater. We may still have a chance at rebuilding what was once lost to us."
 
 LIT_navy_2:0 "Primitive Designs"
 LIT_navy_2_desc:0 "It is true that our designs are primitive. Much worse than what our ancestors had to make do with, but this is the reality at hoof we have to deal with. Our technological capacity have not given us an advantage in the matter of remaining unchallenged, so for now we must contend with shakey rafts and wooden canoes. Our time will come."
 
 LIT_navy_3:0 "Naval Armaments"
 LIT_navy_3_desc:0 "Those Naval Armaments will have been found in the ruins of the Old World, so with all the ingenuity of the Old rld at our disposal, let's try and make the best of it, for the ocean that separated us will be able to be traversed by our navy once more. For that brighter future, we shall build towards it with eager anticipation."
 
 LIT_navy_4:0 "A Seafaring Doctrine"
 LIT_navy_4_desc:0 "A proper way to conduct our forces at sea will imminently necessary if we are to strive for ever grander ambitions. Left unchecked, our coastlines will become vulnerable to hostility and the enemy that cry for our blood will never let us rest in the easy hope of peace. It is a priority, then, to make our navy know how we plan to fight at sea, in the rivers, and perhaps even further beyond."
 
 LIT_navy_5:0 "Behemoths of the Sea"
 LIT_navy_5_desc:0 "Our mightiest and proudest plans will be to build those mechanical monsters that will leave nopony unsafe. Those behemoths will defend us to our very last breath and keep our dreams aflame. It may be ambitious, but we will be certain then that our might as a naval power will remain unchallenged for many years to come if those grand plans come to fruition."
 
 ###Political###
 
 ###Revanchist###
 
 LIT_shake_things_up:0 "Shaking things up"
 LIT_shake_things_up_desc:0 "Our political system have been stangating for far too long, it is clear that new leadership is needed if we are to ever to reclaim our past glories and pay the Featherbrush Talons back for our humiliating defeat in the Thunder War."
 
 LIT_revanchist_coalition:0 "The Revanchist Coalition"
 LIT_revanchist_coalition_desc:0 "It is an undeniable advantage that works in our favour that there are many who are of like mind on the issue of exacting sweet revenge on our enemies. We shall combine together and form a coalition to our end goal. Those cowards who chose not to side with us at this critical moment will come to regret their complacency."
 
 LIT_deal_with_plainsraiders:0 "A Deal with the Plainsraiders"
 LIT_deal_with_plainsraiders_desc:0 "The plainsraiders are weak and as degenerate as the rest of the savages that populate this wasteland, but it cannot be denied that they are a convenient ally for the time being. Perhaps at this moment in time, it would be to our benefit to strike a deal with them. This will not come to back us in the back at any future point in time, of course."
 
 LIT_black_market_weapons:0 "Buy up Rare Weapons"
 LIT_black_market_weapons_desc:0 "Those rare weapons that we've only heard about yet seen before could play a decisive role in future warfare. It is imperative for us to acquire those wonderful and hard-to-find Old Era weapons. There have been plenty of stories of what destruction and calamity could be caused by even one lone wanderer armed with the right type of weaponry."
 
 LIT_push_out_the_complacent:0 "Push out the Complacent"
 LIT_push_out_the_complacent_desc:0 "Now is the time for the complacent to pay. They have been making decisions for us for way too long. It is clear that this can no longer stand. Their presence are no longer tolerated nor welcomed in our midst, it is high time to show them that their inaction and weakness are no longer what drives us. It is only the sweet thought of revenge and conquest that will drive us forward now. Like lightning, we strike."
 
 LIT_second_thunder_war:0 "The Second Thunder War"
 LIT_second_thunder_war_desc:0 "And so it begins. Our glory and honour will be restored, and the ponies of the wasteland will finally know the true superiority of our ways. There no longer be anymore barbarism for us to tolerate, for we have prepared for this moment and we shall finally be triumphant! This day will be won by us and us alone!"
 
 LIT_inevitable_conclusion:0 "The Inevitable Conclusion"
 LIT_inevitable_conclusion_desc:0 "It was inevitable. The conclusion for this pitiful conflict was written long before the drums of war had finished their little tune. We had the ponies, the industry, and all the resources this wasteland could afford to us. In this blighted land, we stand unbowed. From our destiny, we can see that more glory and victories will be with us in the future. This will be our eram and our era will be unchallenged and unopposed, no matter who dares to question our supremacy and the rightful way of life."
 
 LIT_hook_hoof_wins:0 "Hook Hoof wins Out"
 LIT_hook_hoof_wins_desc:0 "After several Days of Fighting in the streets, the Enclavists have finally been driven from the cities, and in the end it was been clear that those upstarts will never amount to anything. They may scream their little slogans and fly around like headless chickens, but they had no true vision. It was to be expected, really."
 
 LIT_kill_enclavists:0 "Root out Enclavist Supporters"
 LIT_kill_enclavists_desc:0 "We have passed. Their pathetic barricades and meagre resistance was nothing compared to the might of our abilities and the determination of our nation to improve and to stand on our four hooves in this wasteland. So it comes down to this, we will stamp that now remains of our pathetic base of supporters, who have been demoralised by defeat after defeat. Soon, nothing will remain of them and we shall truly stand unopposed."
 
 LIT_march_plainstown:0 "March unto Plainstown"
 LIT_march_plainstown_desc:0 "Now it is clear what our next course of action shall be, to march down to Plainstown and truly demonstrate the popularity of our movement and our strength in numbers. This will send a message to those who might still harbour thoughts of going against us; we shall remain a threat to all those who think we will bow down to them. We take this as a point of pride."
 
 LIT_assimilate_warbands:0 "Assimilate the Warbands"
 LIT_assimilate_warbands_desc:0 "The warbards have remained outside of our control for far too long, it is intolerable that the status quo can be allowed to continue on any further. They will be integrated into our great plans and structures, and this shall come to pass whether they want to or not. It is time for action."
 
 LIT_ploughshares_swords:0 "Ploughshares into Swords"
 LIT_ploughshares_swords_desc:0 "The ponies of the wasteland will know of our might and they shall say, 'Come, let us go up to the restored city of Cloudsdale, to know of the greatness that we posses. For out of the ashes of Old Equestria shall go forth instruction, and the word of their unity in strength.' We shall judge the nations of the wasteland, for they are weak. Come, it is a time for war; let us beat our plowshares into swords, and our pruning hooks into spears."
 
 LIT_prepare_great_struggle:0 "Prepare to Reunite Appleloosa"
 LIT_prepare_great_struggle_desc:0 "Our greatest ambitions is at hand! Arise, great nation, and march forth to reclaim the anciet mantle of Appleloosa! For too long, this region has remained locked in decay and division. The seeds of discord sown between the hearts of the gentle ponies from here to the coast of Manehatten. No longer can we tolerate such a sorry state of affairs, we must liberate our fellow ponies from themselves! To war!"
 
 LIT_des_fuck_OAP:0 "Through the Desert to seize the Oasis"
 LIT_des_fuck_OAP_desc:0 "We cannot abide by the stain that is Old Appleloosa to exist much longer. Their current system is abominable, a mess, and a blight upon the wasteland. They have no future in our dreams of a greater, and more united wasteland. Their independence is joke, and they shall know what it means to be under our control."
 
 LIT_des_fuck_NAP:0 "Burning the Lone City"
