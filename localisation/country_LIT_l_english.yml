### FOCUS TREE ###
##################

### Opening Focuses ###
 
 LIT_Starting_Focus:0 "The Weather Factory"
 LIT_Starting_Focus_desc:0 "The Weather Factory was once the pride and joy of Cloudsdale. Before the war, the Factory regulated and manufactured Equestria's weather patterns, keeping the seasons in order. Now, it is nothing more than a shadow of its former self within the ruins of a once-great city."
 
 LIT_Starting_Focus_2:0 "The Fall of Cloudsdale"
 LIT_Starting_Focus_2_desc:0 "Cloudsdale was one of the first hit by the megaspells. Those who survived the blasts and didn't follow the Enclave on still skulk within the ruins. Hope drives them forward, towards what would hopefully be a brighter future. One that would be good for all the little ponies of the wasteland."
 
 LIT_Starting_Focus_3:0 "The Thunder-War"
 LIT_Starting_Focus_3_desc:0 "The Thunder-War was a humiliating defeat suffered at the dirty claws of the Featherbrushes Talons. They had been a menance that to us ever since. If we were to do nothing except wallow in our humiliation without addressing our shortcomings, then we would only taste defeat once more. This is unacceptable."
 
 LIT_assembly_is_called:0 "The Assembly is Called"
 LIT_assembly_is_called_desc:0 "The Assembly of Tribes has always been what elevated us above the neighbours that surround us. Semi-annually, the semi-autonomous tribal villages that are unified under one banner convene together to elect a Leader, representing the Three Pony Tribes. We must hold onto this ideal and to keep on in the face of adversity."
 
 
 ### Industry ###
 
 LIT_economic_matters:0 "Economic Matters"
 LIT_economic_matters_desc:0 "Our economy suffer from many woes and difficulties. It would be prudent for us to address our economic situation so that we can make our little corner of Old Equestria just a little bit more prosperous, a little more bountiful to the ponies that live here."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale:0 "Prepare Cloudsdale for Reconstruction"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_desc:0 "The Pegasi that once lived around the remains of their ancestral home in the Cloudsdale Ruins formed the foundation of our system, now it is time for us to return that favour. We can help rebuild. It will be difficult, but it will also be worth it."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_infrastructure:0 "Infrastructure around Cloudsdale"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_infrastructure_desc:0 "The infrastructure we have around Cloudsdale is a joke. What little we have are loosely cobbled-together structures always at risk of collapse and always vulnerable to attacks from ghouls or other scavengers. It is time to make sure we live in better conditions."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_scavenge:0 "Scavenge what can't be repaired"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_scavenge_desc:0 "Yes, there are plenty of things that can't be repaired. But the wonders of the Old World are plentiful and there for us to take. What could be replaced should be replaced. It is clear that this could never go wrong in any way, shape, or form."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_cloudship:0 "A Magnificient Find"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_cloudship_desc:0 "We have managed to find something magnificent! A cloudship was discovered in our searches through the ruins and now, perhaps we will have the opportunity to improve upon our situations with this new opportunity."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_settling:0 "Begin settling the outskirts"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_settling_desc:0 "The outskirts have always been quite close to being empty and desolate, but this will not do. If we fail to use our territory effectively, then we would only leave ourselves vulnerable to our neighbours. We must settle those outermost peripheries."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_factories:0 "Repair some of the Cloud-factories"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_factories_desc:0 "Our repeated attempts at reshaping the Cloudsdale Ruins have borne fruit. Now, there is an unprecedent opportunity for us to repair those old, defunct cloud-factories so that, once more, Cloudsdale's old glories could be restored."
