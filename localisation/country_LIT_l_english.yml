### Opening Focuses ###
 
 LIT_Starting_Focus:0 "The Weather Factory"
 LIT_Starting_Focus_desc:0 "The weather factory was once the pride and joy of Cloudsdale. Before the war, the factory regulated and manufactured Equestria's weather patterns, keeping the seasons in order. Now, it is nothing more than a shadow of its former self within the ruins of a once-great city."
 
 LIT_Starting_Focus_2:0 "The Fall of Cloudsdale"
 LIT_Starting_Focus_2_desc:0 "Cloudsdale was one of the first hit by the megaspells. Those who survived the blasts and didn't follow the Enclave on still skulk within the ruins. Hope drives them forward, towards what would hopefully be a brighter future. One that would be good for all the little ponies of the Wasteland."
 
 LIT_Starting_Focus_3:0 "The Thunder-War"
 LIT_Starting_Focus_3_desc:0 "The Thunder-War was a humiliating defeat suffered at the dirty claws of Featherbrush's Talons. They have been a menance to us ever since. If we were to do nothing except wallow in our humiliation without addressing our shortcomings, then we would only taste defeat once more. This is unacceptable."
 
 LIT_assembly_is_called:0 "The Assembly"
 LIT_assembly_is_called_desc:0 "The Assembly of Tribes has always been what elevated us above the neighbours that surround us. Semi-annually, the semi-autonomous tribal villages that are unified under one banner convene together to discuss their problems and work together to solve them. We must hold onto this ideal if we wish to carry on in the face of adversity."
 
 
 ### Industry ###
 
 LIT_economic_matters:0 "Economic Matters"
 LIT_economic_matters_desc:0 "Our economy suffer from many woes and difficulties. It would be prudent for us to address our economic situation so that we can make our little corner of Old Equestria just a little bit more prosperous, a little more bountiful to the ponies that live here."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale:0 "Prepare Cloudsdale for Reconstruction"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_desc:0 "The pegasi that once lived around the remains of their ancestral home in the Cloudsdale ruins formed the foundation of our system, now it is time for us to return that favour. We can help rebuild. It will be difficult, but it will also be worth it."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_infrastructure:0 "Infrastructure Around Cloudsdale"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_infrastructure_desc:0 "The infrastructure we have around Cloudsdale is a joke. What little we have are loosely cobbled-together structures always at risk of collapse and always vulnerable to attacks from ghouls or other scavengers. It is time to make sure we live in better conditions."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_scavenge:0 "Scavenge What Can't Be Repaired"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_scavenge_desc:0 "Yes, there are plenty of things that can't be repaired. But the wonders of the Old World are plentiful and there for us to take. What could be replaced should be replaced. It is clear that this could never go wrong in any way, shape, or form."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_cloudship:0 "A Magnificient Find"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_cloudship_desc:0 "We have managed to find something magnificent! A cloudship was discovered in our searches through the ruins and now, perhaps we will have the opportunity to improve upon our situation."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_settling:0 "Begin Settling the Outskirts"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_settling_desc:0 "The outskirts have always been quite close to being empty and desolate, but this will not do. If we fail to use our territory effectively, then we would only leave ourselves vulnerable to our neighbours. We must settle those outermost peripheries."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_factories:0 "Repair Some of the Cloud-Factories"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_factories_desc:0 "Our repeated attempts at reshaping the Cloudsdale ruins bore fruit. Now, there is an unprecedent opportunity for us to repair those old, defunct cloud-factories so that, once more, Cloudsdale's old glories could be restored."
 
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_finish:0 "A Proud City Once More!"
 LIT_rebuilding_cloudsdale_finish_desc:0 "Finally, Cloudsdale can stand amongst the proud cities of the Equestrian Wasteland once more. It's not what it once was, to be sure. Far from it. But now we can at least point to our shining city in the Wasteland and say its name with pride."
 
 LIT_country_whole:0 "Our Country as a Whole..."
 LIT_country_whole_desc:0 "Though Cloudsdale has once again become a great and powerful industrial centre, our country can't build off of Cloudsdale alone, no matter how much we would wish for it to be so. The Hinterlands and the isolated settlements that make up the rest of our territory need to be developed with just as much care."
 
 LIT_country_streets:0 "Build Streets Between Settlements"
 LIT_country_streets_desc:0 "There are few streets that connects our settlements. It would be nice if the ponies could finally enjoy paved roads again. Our roadworks project will surely reduce travel time and set the ground for more ambitious construction projects down the line."
 
 LIT_country_power:0 "Our Own Electricity"
 LIT_country_power_desc:0 "It is paramount that we are energy-sufficient. Whatever we can do to make our little piece of the Wasteland be filled with electric lights and all the splendors of the old world will surely motivate our people to believe in our ideals with stronger conviction."
 
 LIT_country_enterprise:0 "Encourage Private Enterprise"
 LIT_country_enterprise_desc:0 "Small businesses are setting up shops here, the caravans came and unloaded their weary wagons of goods here. Perhaps all of those are good, positive actions that need to be encouraged. Give them some room trade and sell."
 
 LIT_country_clearance:0 "Wide-Scale Land Clearance"
 LIT_country_clearance_desc:0 "The end of Old Equestria gave way for nature to take control of much our land and left our cities enveloped within dense forestry and populated by little critters. The rubble and the Wasteland environment must be cleared away and reshaped to better accomodate our little ponies. Comfortable living will be our ultimate goal."
 
 LIT_country_closer:0 "Closer Together now"
 LIT_country_closer_desc:0 "It is fair to say that our little, scrappy piece of the Wasteland become the start of something beautiful. The hustle and bustle of trade and growing communities that are now more and more interconnected thanks to our roads renewed our bonds with each other. What was once just a loose connection of wastelanders struggling to survive now feels connected to a national purpose and a greater community."
 
 LIT_country_finish:0 "A Modern Wasteland Nation"
 LIT_country_finish_desc:0 "Hurrah! Three cheers for the hard work that we've done thus far, for now we can finally call ourselves a true model for the Wasteland to follow. Surely those who subsist upon the scraps tossed aside by those slavers will see our progress as a beacon of hope."
 
 LIT_apple_ambition:0 "Appleloosan Ambitions"
 LIT_apple_ambition_desc:0 "Now that we have industrialized and modernised sufficiently, it is time that we carry the torch of progress to the rest of the Appleloosan region. How can we be comfortable, knowing our neighbours are starving, impoverished, and in need of upliftment? It betrays every one of our treasured ideals to not help!"
 
 LIT_OAP_railroad:0 "South-Appleloosan Railroads"
 LIT_OAP_railroad_desc:0 "The new proposed ideas for the railroads had been met with skepticism in the past, after all, much of what remained of the old railroad hubs had been taken and reappropriated by slavers and raiders. But now with us as a beacon of hope in the Appleloosan region, perhaps we can build those railways again connect us fellow ponies closer together."
 
 LIT_lichenfield_glass:0 "Lichenfield Glass Factory"
 LIT_lichenfield_glass_desc:0 "The Lichenfield Glass Factory was an ambitious idea, to be sure, but one that will be necessary in order for us to properly rebuild as a nation. After all, the bombs had shattered the windows of many a fine buildings. Perhaps if we could repair some of those buildings, we could begin making progress towards something beautiful."
 
 LIT_OAP_solar:0 "Desert Solar-Farms"
 LIT_OAP_solar_desc:0 "It many seem ridiculius to many that we are developing alternative methods of energy harvesting in the Wasteland. We were not builders, but rather scavengers for much of our past. It is an uncomfortable truth, but all of our projects have culminated in this idea of taking something once left behind in the Wasteland and improving upon it. We will restore these ancient solar-farms so that no pony will feel cold in the winter again!"
 
 LIT_OAP_gun_foundries:0 "Nationalize Ranger Gun Foundries"
 LIT_OAP_gun_foundries_desc:0 "The Gun Foundries are an integral part of our military apparatus, we cannot leave them in the hands of private interests, and so they must be placed under the supervision of our direct administration. It is high time that our forces have guns they could count upon, created for them by us."
 
 LIT_NAP_integration:0 "North Appleloosan Trade Cooperation"
 LIT_NAP_integration_desc:0 "The NATC will be a thing of beauty, a true testament to inter-regional harmony and cooperation. When the trade flows so freely, all of our little ponies will prosper. Our continued nation-building efforts have once again proven that we are the beacon of hope in this blighted land."
 
 LIT_NAP_settle_artisans:0 "Appropriate Appleloosan Artisans"
 LIT_NAP_settle_artisans_desc:0 "Our artisans are the best in Appleloosa, and perhaps the best in all the land! But we need to make sure those who had come to settle here could truly provide value to us. We must always prioritise how their talents could contribute to the great effort to rebuild, after all."
 
 LIT_NAP_monopolies:0 "Monopolize Appleloosan Trade"
 LIT_NAP_monopolies_desc:0 "We are the dominant trading power in the region, we hold control that no other powers before us save Old Equestria could claim. Celestia Herself would surely be proud of what we have done with this place. It is only rational, then, that we allow for no other competitors. They cannot be better than us, after all. So why let them even try?"
 
 LIT_NAP_precision_manufacturing:0 "Invest in Precision Manufacturing"
 LIT_NAP_precision_manufacturing_desc:0 "Precision manufacturing, centuries ago, led to the Appleloosan region flourishing with well-produced equipment and fine products. We would do well to remember the lessons of the past and apply them to the present, so that we may have a better future."
 
 LIT_ROK_ports:0 "The Ports of Hoof City"
 LIT_ROK_ports_desc:0 "Hoof City has continued to be a trade hub for all those who still have the capability of conducting maritime trade and a centre for naval construction. It would be in our interests to develop them so that we could once again see the sea from coast to coast."
 
 LIT_ROK_moar_rocks:0 "Increase Rock Production"
 LIT_ROK_moar_rocks_desc:0 "The Rock Farms of the past had not survived well after the mega-spells caused the collpase of our civilisation, they were chronically under-producing and often in a state of disrepair. There are several options outlined to increase rock production so that we may have the ability to set more and more ambitious quotas in the future."
 
 LIT_ROK_east_settlement:0 "Settle East Appleloosa"
 LIT_ROK_east_settlement_desc:0 "East Appleloosa is filled with hostile critters and a harsh environment that had led to it being less settled than the other regions of Appleloosa. The overabundance of raiders and slavers that called this plaxce home deterred many from settling down here. It is high time we rectified this by encouraging more emigration through monetary incentives and local benefits."
 
 LIT_ROK_composites:0 "Subsidize Composite Production"
 LIT_ROK_composites_desc:0 "We have truly become an industralised powerhouse in the region, but we must not be satisfied with just this. We could do more, and our ambitions are chafing at the edges of what we are realistically capable of, so it is only logical that we offer subsidies to incentivise even more growth. To reach higher than we have in the past, and to create more jobs, our little ponies will surely thank us for this undertaking."
 
 LIT_dream_fulfilled:0 "The Dream, Fulfilled!"
 LIT_dream_fulfilled_desc:0 "It has been a long journey of industrialisation but our hard work has bore us fruit. We stand tall in the bright sunny south, in peace and content. We will defend our vision, and perhaps share this once and future dream with of Equestria."
 
 ###Emergency###
 
 LIT_emergency1:0 "Emergency Mobilization"
 LIT_emergency1_desc:0 "The Ministry of Arcane Sciences had seen fit to disturb the fragile peace of the region by way of war. This is unacceptable, they seem to be under the impression that we would be nothing but pushovers. They are wrong. To arms! We shall defend our home to the last mare standing!"
 
 LIT_emergency2:0 "Confiscate Civillian Arms"
 LIT_emergency2_desc:0 "The war has developed not necessarily in a way that is conductive to the betterment of our wonderful economy. We must ask for our civilians to support our troops at the front by relinquishing their old weaponry, however hard this may come to our populace. Our home must be defended from the old Ministry's belligerence, and we need more guns."
 
 LIT_emergency3:0 "Everypony to the Front!"
 LIT_emergency3_desc:0 "To the front! Your home must be defended! How can we beat back the barbarous Ministry at the door if we lack soldiers? Our land will not be sacrificed, and we shall not budge from our positions. Ponies, we need you there at frontlines! We shall overcome them with our numbers and liberate them from the tyrannies imposed upon them by their Minister!"
 
 LIT_emergency4:0 "Prepare a Fallback Line"
 LIT_emergency4_desc:0 "The war situation has developed perhaps not necessarily to our advantage. It has become a necessity to fall back to a more defensible position to excise their poison and hold fast. We have to begin construction of a new fallback line. Only then will we have a chance of ever mounting a counter-attack."
 
 LIT_emergency5:0 "Our Last Stand"
 LIT_emergency5_desc:0 "Is this the end of the line for us? No! We shall never surrender to the likes of them, nor shall we capitulate to their own foolish and short-sighted whims. Our ideals have held us together for so long, it shall not betray us now. Behind every city, every town, every street, and every house there shall be us. We will not give them the satisfaction of being docile subjects in our last days! We will take our stand!"
 
 
 ###LEGACY Military###
 
 LIT_reform_armed_forces:0 "Reforming our Meager Forces"
 LIT_reform_armed_forces_desc:0 "It has been an inescapable reality for much of our history that what pathetic remains of our 'military' would not be able to compete with any of our much stronger neighbours. If we continue to be complacent in the face of danger, then we are only inviting another humiliating defeat like the Thunder-War. Reforms must be implemented."
 
 LIT_spec_ops_focus:0 "Focus on Special Forces"
 LIT_spec_ops_focus_desc:0 "Our special forces have not always been able to be trained to the standard that was expected of them. In order to prepare against any invasion by our neighbour, we must have reliable and elite units at the ready to fight harder than the average pony troops. Therefore, we must prioritise training up the best of the best, no matter the cost."
 
 LIT_united_in_service:0 "United in Service"
 LIT_united_in_service_desc:0 "United forever, in friendship and service. Our mighty forces will endure against the hardest challenges and survive through even the darkest days and the stormiest nights! Long live our ideals! The Wasteland will never extinguish our free and unified ideals. As ponies, we stand together in diversity, against hate and slavery. Our names will bre echoed through history, for we are stronger together."
 
 LIT_anti_tank:0 "Steelcrackers"
 LIT_anti_tank_desc:0 "Our latest technological innovations will surely destroy even the mightiest invaders at our doorstep. Those so-called 'anti-machine weapons' are perfect for our purposes against the enemies who wish to mobilise any sort of mechanised forces against us. Our top researchers have already been struggling night and day to find ways to better integrate those new measures into our existing forces. We pray to Celestia that they will be enough."
 
 LIT_spec_doctrine:0 "Our Specialized Doctrine"
 LIT_spec_doctrine_desc:0 "In the face of insurmountable odds, we must still be prepared. No matter what the world may choose to throw at us, we can be reassured by our general staff's new ideas on how we may overcome those struggles. Already, there have been echoes of reforming our chain of command to adhere to either the war doctrines or to use the doctrines perfected through bloodied fighting in the Wasteland. In the end, we can only hope we have a right choice."
 
 LIT_value_mobility:0 "The Value of Mobility"
 LIT_value_mobility_desc:0 "Speed has always held a special place in our hearts. No matter how dangerous their weapons, if we can evade their attacks, then we will always remain unscathed. For mobility will give us greater manuevarbility in this blasted hellscape. All we can hope for is to best them by tactics or by speed, even if we must fight against a greater power than we."
 
 LIT_PA_research:0 "Power Armor Research"
 LIT_PA_research_desc:0 "The most beautiful and terrifying symbol of Old Equestria was their power armor soldiers, which remain as the undisputed kings of the battlefield, regardless of theatre or terrain. We must hasten our research in resotring those old glories so that we too can claim dominance over our foes. They will be in for a bitter surprise if they see us as just a docile stepping stone to future greatness."
 
 LIT_mass_inf_focus:0 "Focus on Massed Infantry"
 LIT_mass_inf_focus_desc:0 "Numbers will overcome any deficit or shortcomings that still remain in our military forces. So long as our soldiers have the will and are willing to risk it all for our great ideals, then victory would only be inevitable. We will seize the day, in the face of such overwhelming danger there will be countless ponies eager to join up with us to fight. On-hooves, we will be unparalleled."
 
 LIT_chems_research:0 "Increase Chem Production"
 LIT_chems_research_desc:0 "We shall produce more chems so that our ponies will not falter on the battlefield and be ready fight for another day. It may be a drastic measure to relentlessly increase production, but we will be able to fulfil those new quotas. It is certain that greater ambitions could not be caged by timidness and a hesitation to place more funding into our military. There can never be enough bottlecaps invested in our soldiers!"
 
 LIT_universal_doctrine:0 "Doctrine Research"
 LIT_universal_doctrine_desc:0 "We will continue in our research for the greater understanding of how to prosecute wars in the modern day. It was clear that no matter what it was, we can always improve upon the foundations that we built so that our home will be secured against those horrid forces that dare amass outside our borders. It is clear, our path forward is no longer shrouded in fear and uncertainty."
 
 LIT_virtue_bravery:0 "The Virtue of Bravery"
 LIT_virtue_bravery_desc:0 "The outsiders are not like us, we are the only ones truly capable of bravery and good virtuous discipline in the Wasteland. Our rise to greatness was inevitable, and this understanding must be reinforced on every level within our soldiers and officer corps. They must not give in to fear and be ever-resilient, not matter what it is they face. We plant our hooves in the ground, and will not take even a single step back."
 
 LIT_grenades_for_all:0 "Grenades for Everypony!"
 LIT_grenades_for_all_desc:0 "Grenades are the future of our mighty initiative. It has been clear from the very beginning how useful incendiaries can be. You get a grenade! You get a grenade! Check under your seats and you will find more grenades there! Everyone get grenades! The time for fun explosions have come, and we shall bring them to the battlefield with joy in our hearts and a spring in our hoof-steps."
 
 LIT_gun_research:0 "Military Research Initiative"
 LIT_gun_research_desc:0 "Our military research initiatives requests ever more funding, and we are more than happy to comply with their every demand. We cannot risk falling behind our rivals and neighbours lest they see as weak and ripe for the picking. As we progress further in our technological research and innovate where they have failed, we will remain triumphant. Our arsenals will be stocked with only the most advanced and powerful weaponry for our fine soldiers."
 
 LIT_illustrious_elite:0 "The Illustrious Elite"
 LIT_illustrious_elite_desc:0 "The elites have always supported our many plans, our greates amibitions, and was there even in our most humiliating elite. The time has come for us to reward them for their steadfast nature by allowing them a bigger share of the military and for them to contribute to our efforts by placing them as a part of our process of reforming the military. They shall join, and they shall be grateful for the privilege of doing so."
 
 LIT_more_bodies_bullets:0 "More Bodies Than Bullets"
 LIT_more_bodies_bullets_desc:0 "The soldiers we have are not enough to satisfy the basic requirements drafted up by our War Committee, it is clear to us that we require more and more societal participation in our armed forces or else we will be vulnerable to the outsiders. We must never show even a moment of weakness against those who conspire against us."
 
 LIT_airforce_1:0 "Foundations of an Airforce"
 LIT_airforce_1_desc:0 "We may not have much of what most would call an 'airforce' but we have the capacity to create one, to be sure. Our strong industrial base and connection to the skies have given us more than enough of a headstart compared to our neighbours in terms what we can do in terms of aerial combat. We would do well to expand upon the foundations here and truly create a terrifying and 'awesome' force in the skies that our enemies shall never look up to the skies without feeling fear."
 
 LIT_airforce_2:0 "Fighter Development"
 LIT_airforce_2_desc:0 "The development of fighter planes have come at a steady and acceptable pace. We are more than ready to integrate them into our newly created airforce at this point in time."
 
 LIT_airforce_3:0 "Attack-Plane Development"
 LIT_airforce_3_desc:0 "The continued development of attack-planes have been a boon for our now-formidable air force. Though we have been progressing along these lines quite nicely for a while now, it is easy to see that our continued research into aerial efforts will ensure that we remain unchallenged and unmatched. All creatures of the sky shall soon find themselves outmatched by our might!" 
 
 LIT_airforce_4:0 "Aerial Doctrines"
 LIT_airforce_4_desc:0 "The aerial doctrines we have available before us give us many oppotunities to refine our ability to engage in combat high above the clouds and to wage war on land. After all, if no other airforce could challenge us in the sky, how could they ever hope to beat our little ponies on the battle on land?"
 
 LIT_airforce_5:0 "Construct Airship-Yards"
 LIT_airforce_5_desc:0 "The Airship-Yards of Old Equestria have since became useless and impossible to repair. If we are to climb to ever higher heights of greatness, then we must construct newer Airship-Yards fit-for-purpose. Our hope as ponies will rest in our capacity to maintain a great formidable military force. Let's hope it will forever be terrifying and majestic in the eyes of our enemies."
 
 LIT_navy_1:0 "Countruct Dockyards"
 LIT_navy_1_desc:0 "Naval capabilities werre an oft-neglected aspect of our military as the old tri-service arrangement fell to the wayside as the Old Equestrian Navy was left unsalvageable by us and too distant an ambition to seriously consider. But now we must have some hope of building a small force that could one day become something greater. We may still have a chance at rebuilding what was once lost to us."
 
 LIT_navy_2:0 "Primitive Designs"
 LIT_navy_2_desc:0 "It is true that our designs are primitive. Much worse than what our ancestors had to make do with, but this is the reality at hoof we have to deal with. Our technological capacity have not given us an advantage in the matter of remaining unchallenged, so for now we must contend with shakey rafts and wooden canoes. Our time will come."
 
 LIT_navy_3:0 "Naval Armaments"
 LIT_navy_3_desc:0 "The Equestrian Navy once dominated the seas, and soon we shall as well! We shall launch scavenging efforts to find the naval weaponry of the old world with which we may secure our waterways. One day, we shall even sail across the ocean and become the greatest naval power of the Wasteland. We shall build towards that future with eager anticipation."
 
 LIT_navy_4:0 "A Seafaring Doctrine"
 LIT_navy_4_desc:0 "A proper way to conduct our forces at sea will imminently necessary if we are to strive for ever grander ambitions. Left unchecked, our coastlines will become vulnerable to hostility and the enemy that cry for our blood will never let us rest in the easy hope of peace. It is a priority, then, to make our navy know how we plan to fight at sea, in the rivers, and perhaps even further beyond."
 
 LIT_navy_5:0 "Behemoths of the Sea"
 LIT_navy_5_desc:0 "Our mightiest and proudest plans will be to build those mechanical monsters that will leave nopony unsafe. Those behemoths will defend us to our very last breath and keep our dreams aflame. It may be ambitious, but we will be certain then that our might as a naval power will remain unchallenged for many years to come if those grand plans come to fruition."
 
 ###NEW Military###
 LIT_army_better_guns:0 "Better Guns"
 LIT_army_better_guns_desc:0 "A gun is useless if it blows up in our hooves. We must ensure that our weapons are of the highest quality, so that our soldiers may wield weapons worthy of defending our beloved nation."
 
 LIT_army_more_guns:0 "More Guns"
 LIT_army_more_guns_desc:0 "We have many enemies and not near enough guns. Solving the later problem will do wonders towards solving the former. Let's see to it that it's done."
 
 LIT_army_more_bodies:0 "More Bodies"
 LIT_army_more_bodies_desc:0 "We can build guns all day everyday, but we still need soldiers to wield them. Let's see if we can't round up some of the locals and remind them of their duty to their fellow ponies."
 
 LIT_army_military_strat:0 "Develop A Strategy"
 LIT_army_military_strat_desc:0 "It's time to strategize! Draw up some plans, come up with new ideas, and ensure that our army is prepared to take on whatever it may meet."
 
 LIT_army_better_training:0 "Better Training"
 LIT_army_better_training_desc:0 "We need to ensure our soldiers are as well-trained as possible. It wouldn't do for them to quake in their boots and flee at the mere mention of violence!"
 
 LIT_army_more_divisions:0 "Recruit Honorary Warbands"
 LIT_army_more_divisions_desc:0 "There are many within our nation who would previously of not met the standards of any of our dominant Warbands. However, we could perhaps form them into seperate units that are outside of the standard Warband structure."
 
 LIT_army_elite_divisions:0 "Form Elite Warbands"
 LIT_army_elite_divisions_desc:0 "Our nation deserves only the best to defend it! We will seek out the greatest soldiers across our land to come and join our military. With their experience, none can hope to defeat us!"
 
 LIT_army_future:0 "The Future of the Warbands"
 LIT_army_future_desc:0 "Now that our political crisis is over, it is time for us to decide the future of our Warbands..."
 
 ###Political###
 
 ###Revanchist###
 
 LIT_shake_things_up:0 "Shaking Things Up"
 LIT_shake_things_up_desc:0 "Our political system have been stagnating for far too long, it is clear that new leadership is needed if we are to ever to reclaim our past glories and pay the Featherbrush Talons back for our humiliating defeat in the Thunder-War."
 
 LIT_revanchist_coalition:0 "Reaffirm the Coalition"
 LIT_revanchist_coalition_desc:0 "It is an undeniable advantage that works in our favour that there are many who are of like mind on the issue of exacting sweet revenge on our enemies. Together, we shall march towards our shared goal of bringing our wrath down upon those who would oppose us."
 
 LIT_deal_with_plainsraiders:0 "A Deal With the Plainsraiders"
 LIT_deal_with_plainsraiders_desc:0 "The Plainsraiders are weak and as degenerate as the rest of the savages that populate the Wasteland, but it cannot be denied that they are a convenient ally for the time being. Perhaps at this moment in time, it would be to our benefit to strike a deal with them. This will not come to bite us in the back at any future point in time, of course."
 
 LIT_black_market_weapons:0 "Buy Up Rare Weapons"
 LIT_black_market_weapons_desc:0 "Those rare weapons that we've only heard about and have never seen before could play a decisive role in future warfare. It is imperative for us to acquire those wonderful and hard-to-find old era weapons. There have been plenty of stories of what destruction and calamity could be caused by even one lone wanderer armed with the right type of weaponry."
 
 LIT_push_out_the_complacent:0 "Push Out the Complacent"
 LIT_push_out_the_complacent_desc:0 "Now is the time for the complacent to pay. They have been making decisions for us for way too long. It is clear that this can no longer stand. Their presence is no longer tolerated nor welcomed in our midst, it is high time to show them that their inaction and weakness are no longer what drives us. It is only the sweet thought of revenge and conquest that will drive us forward now. Like lightning, we strike."
 
 LIT_second_thunder_war:0 "The Second Thunder-War"
 LIT_second_thunder_war_desc:0 "And so it begins. Our glory and honour will be restored, and the ponies of the Wasteland will finally know the true superiority of our ways. There will no longer be anymore barbarism for us to tolerate, for we have prepared for this moment and we shall finally be triumphant! This day will be won by us and us alone!"
 
 LIT_inevitable_conclusion:0 "The Inevitable Conclusion"
 LIT_inevitable_conclusion_desc:0 "It was inevitable. The conclusion for this pitiful conflict was written long before the drums of war had finished their mighty tune. We had the ponies, the industry, and all the resources this Wasteland could afford us. In this blighted land, we stand unbowed. We can clearly see that more glory and victories will be with us in the future, for that is our destiny. This will be our era, and our era will be unchallenged and unopposed, no matter who dares to question our supremacy and our rightful way of life."
 
 LIT_hook_hoof_wins:0 "§RHook Hoof Wins Out§!"
 LIT_hook_hoof_wins_desc:0 "After several days of fighting in the streets, the Enclavists have finally been driven from the cities, and in the end it was made clear that those upstarts will never amount to anything. They may scream their little slogans and fly around like headless chickens, but they had no true vision. It was to be expected, really."
 
 LIT_kill_enclavists:0 "Root Out Enclavist Supporters"
 LIT_kill_enclavists_desc:0 "Our nation faced a great test, one which we have passed with flying colors. Their pathetic barricades and meagre resistance was nothing compared to the might of our abilities and the determination of our nation to improve and to stand on our four hooves in the Wasteland. So it comes down to this, we will stamp that which remains of our pathetic foes, who have been demoralised by defeat after defeat. Soon, nothing will remain of them and we shall truly stand unopposed."
 
 LIT_march_plainstown:0 "March Unto Plainstown"
 LIT_march_plainstown_desc:0 "Now it is clear what our next course of action shall be: to march down to Plainstown and truly demonstrate the popularity of our movement and our strength in numbers.

 LIT_trade_water_OAP_desc:0 "We may throw our hooves up in dismay at the practices of Old Appleloosa, but trade and mutual propserity is the right way to conduct ourselves on the international stage. Surely once they see the benefits of freeing the ponies through economic incentives, we will have a better time at convincing them of our way life.

 LIT_erase_past_loss:0 "Forget the Memories"
 LIT_erase_past_loss_desc:0 "The Thunder-War was one of our greatest defeats, still plaguing our public consciousness to this very day.

 LIT_settlement_category:0 "Re-Settling Cloudsdale"
 LIT_settlement_category_desc:0 "The Great City of Cloudsdale and its §GOutskirts§! have been sparesly populated ever since the city was blown out of the sky, but we intend to change that!\nThrough §Cincentives§!, §Opersuasion§! and §Rforced re-settlement§!, we will make sure this city lives up to its great past.\n\nOnce one of the §GOutskirts§! has reached a population of over §R4000§! it will become too dense for further settlement."

 LIT_settle_north:0 "Settle §CNorthern Outskirts§!"
 LIT_settle_north_desc:0 "The Northern Outskirts are perhaps the most pleasant of the outskirts, but also the most scarcely populated. Most settlements in the area are just simple farmsteads. However, some economic incentives would be enough to attract settlers from the north to help populate the land."
 
 LIT_settle_west:0 "Settle §OWestern Outskirts§!"
 LIT_settle_west_desc:0 "The Western Outskirts serve as a border between the plentiful Appleloosan lands to the south and the Cloudsdale region. It wouldn't take much more than a dedicated propaganda campaign to convince ponies to move to these lands."
 
 LIT_settle_south:0 "Settle §RSouthern Outskirts§!"
 LIT_settle_south_desc:0 "The Southern Outskirts are a rough land, with little of value and few reasons to stick around. The locals are often distrustful of outsiders, leading to settlers being rare. If we wish to settle these lands, we shall have to force both outside settlers and the locals to get along."
 
 LIT_clear_centre:0 "Clear the §GGhoul Horde§!"
 LIT_clear_centre_desc:0 "Ghouls plague the ruins of Cloudsdale. It's about time something be done about them. With a dedicated extermination campaign, we can clear these lands of them once and for all."
 
 LIT_settlement_complete:0 "§YRevitalize the Land§!"
 LIT_settlement_complete_desc:0 "Now that the Outskirts are properly settled, we cna now begin the process of transforming the land into something more fitting for our great region. Through hard work and effort, we can turn even the most barren earth into fertile land. We will build the foundation for our future."
 
 LIT_weather_factory_category:0 "The Weather Factory"
 LIT_weather_factory_category_desc:0 "By using our expertise in §rweather manipulation§!, and the facilities of the §rWeather Factory§!, we are able to influence §Crain§! and §Fstorms§ within our Territory.\nOur Capabilities are heavily dependant on our Standing with the §AEnclave§!\n\n[Root.LITGetEnclaveRelation]"

 LIT_NEV_resistance_category:0 "§ODealing With Resistance§!"
 LIT_NEV_resistance_category_desc:0 "Though we may control the land, we do not control the ponies on it. We are facing widespread resistance across our newly acquired territory, from all types of pony and nonpony alike. If we wish to consolidate our control over the ground, we will have to take measures to crush this resistance before it can destroy everything that we've worked so hard for."
 
 LIT_NEV_talon4:0 "Destroy Talon Strongholds"
 LIT_NEV_talon4_desc:0 "The Talons have grown confident from within the confines of their fortresses. If we wish to break them, the first step will be to strip away their layer of security and remind them that they can bleed just the same as anyone else."
 
 LIT_NEV_talon3:0 "Hunt Down Leading Talons"
 LIT_NEV_talon3_desc:0 "With their fortified walls gone, the Talons have taken to a nomadic strategy. They travel across our lands and skies in large armies, attacking any of our ponies they come across. A few key ambushes aimed to take out the leaders that have emerged among them will go a long way towards removing them as a threat."
 
 LIT_NEV_talon2:0 "Arrest Talon Sympathizers"
 LIT_NEV_talon2_desc:0 "Many of the surface dwelling degenerates seem to idolize the Talons, romanticising them as grand heros who seek to topple an oppressive regime. This image of them will not be tolerated. Those who dare spread it must be dealt with accordingly."
 
 LIT_NEV_talon1:0 "Deal With Regina's Talons"
 LIT_NEV_talon1_desc:0 "One particularly troublesome gang of Talons still remains. They will be dealt with, one way or another."
 
 LIT_NEV_republican4:0 "To Kill a Stronghold"
 LIT_NEV_republican4_desc:0 "The Republicans seem to have organized around one central stronghold within the heart of their former lands. What was once the Shattered Hoof Correctional Facility has instead become a military fortress. This is fortunate for us, as that means we have a head to cut off of the snake."
 
 LIT_NEV_republican3:0 "To Kill an Army"
 LIT_NEV_republican3_desc:0 "From the river to the plains, the Republicans fight on. Their dedication to resisting our rule is admirable, but it is about high time they be taught the price of their impudence."
 
 LIT_NEV_republican2:0 "To Kill Ponies"
 LIT_NEV_republican2_desc:0 "There are only so many ponies willing to die for any given cause, especially after watching their compatriots die in droves around them. We shall keep firing our guns, for there is no doubt that we have more bullets than there are Republicans on the surface."
 
 LIT_NEV_republican1:0 "To Kill an Idea"
 LIT_NEV_republican_desc:0 "The time has finally come for these so-called Republicans to be put down, once and for all. Their pathetic excuse for democracy has no place in a world that already contains our far superior truly democratic government."
 
 LIT_NEV_raider4:0 "Deal With the Warlords"
 LIT_NEV_raider4_desc:0 "The Warlords that have arisen in the chaos down below need to be dealt with. Though the simplest option would be to just kill them, perhaps some sort of agreement could be reached instead..."
 
 LIT_NEV_raider3:0 "The War on Raiders"
 LIT_NEV_raider3_desc:0 "We will no longer tolerate troublemakers and ruffians running rampant. The full force of the law shall be brought against them, as we seek to restore order to these fair lands."
 
 LIT_NEV_raider2:0 "Destroy Their Homes"
 LIT_NEV_raider2_desc:0 "The numerous raider gangs that continue to persist across our lands all share one trait in common: They enjoy having roofs over their heads. A dedicated bombing campaign will help make that but a distant dream for them, as their waking hours turn into a nightmare. Of course, there might be some civilian casualties. A reasonable price to pay for order to be restored."
 
 LIT_NEV_raider1:0 "To Uphold Justice"
 LIT_NEV_raider1_desc:0 "Yesterday, chaos and criminalty consumed the surface down below. Today, order and justice prevails across the land. Those few left who dare try to evade the law do so at great risk, a risk that will grow ever greater as we begin our final crackdown on their ilk."
 
 LIT_NEV_freedom4:0 "Making An Example"
 LIT_NEV_freedom4_desc:0 "The ponies of Leslie rise against us, confident in their ability to resist us just as they once resisted the glorified slavers to the north. Their mistake is in assuming that we are as inept as the likes of Neocastle or Mareway. We will quell their rebellion quickly and efficiently, through the best means available."
 
 LIT_NEV_freedom3:0 "Patrolling the Riverside"
 LIT_NEV_freedom3_desc:0 "The rivers have become home to pirates, raiders, and most recently freedom fighters alike. They sail down these waters, attacking and stealing from every settlement they come across. Bolstering our forces on the ground should do well to deter them."
 
 LIT_NEV_freedom2:0 "Forgetting a Myth"
 LIT_NEV_freedom2_desc:0 "Among the freedom fighters, one figure holds an almost martyr like position. The long-deceased Boss Nails has grown into a legend, a figure who is remembered and renown for their dedication to the cause of the Leslie Raiders. Their very name is used to rally the fanatical rebels down below to action, often being shouted prior to their attacks against us. Through a dedicated informational campaign, we hope to counter their own propaganda and remind the people of what Boss Nails really was: A brutal raider and murderer."
 
 LIT_NEV_freedom1:0 "Crushing a Movement"
 LIT_NEV_freedom1_desc:0 "These ponies just can't seem to get it through their thick heads. Despite having their namesake city leveled, they continue to fight. Despite having their boats sunk and their supplies cut off, they continue to fight. Despite having their legend turned into a pariah, they continue to fight. We are tired of it and it is time we deal with them once and for all."
 
 LIT_NEV_bat4:0 "Deploy Agent Apple"
 LIT_NEV_bat4_desc:0 "The dense foliage of New Mango has been the cause of no shortage of problems for us. To combat that, we have developed a new form of herbicide that has proven to be highly effective at dealing with the thick jungle brush that covers those lands. Mass production and deployment of this would do wonders towards our cause on the surface."
 
 LIT_NEV_bat3:0 "Burn the Jungle"
 LIT_NEV_bat3_desc:0 "Agent Apple is a good start, but we can only produce so much of it with the resources we have available. Not enough to deal with all of the bats, certainly. Perhaps we can also utilize something more primitive and cheaper to produce, like fire."
 
 LIT_NEV_bat2:0 "Collapse the Tunnels"
 LIT_NEV_bat2_desc:0 "An intricate system of tunnels span across the now barren lands of New Mango. The bats hiding within like to pop out at the worst of times to make our lives a living Tartarus. Those rats may think themselves safe in the ground, but they'll soon learn that their hidey holes won't save them."
 
 LIT_NEV_bat1:0 "Destroy Their Homes"
 LIT_NEV_bat1_desc:0 "We have those bat-stards on the run. Many of them have fled back to their pathetic towns and cities, foalishly believing that we wouldn't be willing to bomb their families to put down their resistance. It is time we show them the same hatred they have shown us and teach them that nothing on the surface is sacred."

 LIT_event.1.t:0 "The Origin of Rainbows"
 LIT_event.1.d:0 "The Cloudsdale Weather Factory was once the cities pride and joy. It stood proud as one of the first major factories in all of Equestria, built well before even the return of Princess Luna. From clouds to rainbows, it produced all that was needed to maintain the skies across the nation. However, as the War progressed, the importance of the factory was brought into question. What use did rainbows have for the country? This would lead to a great debate among the Cloudsdale government regarding the future of their factory.\n\n The Equestrian Weather Union and the Pegasus Archival Society both pointed to it's importance, both then and historically. They heavily pushed not only for the factory to continue doing what it had always done, but to be expanded. This would prove to be a popular stance among the civilian population.\n\n The Ministry of Awesome would throw it's support behind an alternative plan to retool the factory to help produce aircraft for the war effort. According to their officials, every plane in the skies was another step closer to winning the war. This plan would rapidly gain popularity among the more patriotic of Equestria's citizenry.\n\n As an alternative to both plans, an infamous industrialist would instead purpose that a portion of the factory be refitted to manufacture useful products, which could then be used to aid the war effort. This plan would see the least support among the population, but enjoy some backing from various members of the Cloudsdale City Council.\n\n At the end of the day, it was decided to..."

 LIT_event.2.d:0 "On that day, two centuries ago, the entire world was blanketed in balefire. Millions perished, entire cities were reduced to little more than rubble, and the world was forever changed.\n\n One of the first major targets to be struck by the might of the megaspells was Cloudsdale. The city was crucial to the Equestrian war effort, being home to most pegasi of influence and power. As it fell out of the sky, hundreds of thousands of buildings breaking apart into nothingness, many pegasi sought to flee the city. The majority would flee to the skies, where they would reorganize and go on to found New Cloudsdale. However, a sizable amount of them instead turned towards the ground below, where they would go on to try to build their own society within the ruins of their former home.\n\n Shortly after the end of the world, refugees began to pour into the Cloudsdale area. Many of them were seeking refuge within the city, unaware of its fate, but they would only be met with small groups of pegasi trying to survive within the ruins. These refugees were..."

 LIT_event.3.t:0 "The Beaked Menace"
 LIT_event.3.d:0 "Today, Featherbrush and his Talons seldom venture out of their bunker. Whether due to paranoia, guilt, or old age, Featherbrush has taken to a policy of isolationism towards the other forces of the Wasteland. However, this was not always the case.\n\n The name Featherbrush was once feared across the Wasteland. His band of mercenaries was known for their brutality and willingness to take any contract, with the griffon himself acting worse than most raiders. Countless settlements were razed to nothing, thousands of ponies were executed, and the sight of a griffon in the sky was enough to send entire towns into a panic. It was towards the end of this time that Featherbrush would claim Hill 432 as his new base of operations. One of his last acts of aggression would come in the form of securing the lands surrounding his new headquarters, which would bring about the Thunder-War.\n\n The Thunder-War was a quick offensive on the part of the Talons to push the ponies of the Lightning Scavengers out of the lands to the south of Hill 432. Unfortunately, we were near completely unprepared to deal with the attack, leading to our rapid defeat. However, in those brief moments when griffons could be spotted in the sky, those few soldiers on the border focused on..."

 LIT_event.4.t:0 "The Assembly of Tribes"
 LIT_event.4.d:0 "As our land has all of the different types of pony in equal measure, we have forged a government designed to represent all of them as best we can. Twice a year, the many settlements and villages across our land come together to vote on matters important to the whole. Usually, this is a relatively uneventful occurrence, with a bunch of old elders and local mayors trying to get more funding sent towards their little hamlets rather than towards anything more important. However, this session is already proving to be very different from the usual boring affair.\n\n Normally, the only ponies in attendance would be those representatives sent by their respective communities, the most influential ponies across the nation, and maybe a small number of concerned citizens. This session was anything but normal though, as it also found itself being attended by a large number of ponies from the recently established Revanchist Coalition. Headed by Hook Hoof and Swift Storm themselves, this crowd filled the Assembly Hall. They, along with the ever-persistent Skybreaker, sought to challenge the status quo and send our nation on a new path. Today, the future of the Lightning Scavengers would be decided."

 LIT_event.41.t:0 "Shake Spar Opens"
 LIT_event.41.d:0 "'Friends, I welcome you to the Assembly of Tribes. It is within this hallowed Hall that we have decided upon our future for generations, as we shall for generations more. As you know, the Assembly Hall was built by Lightwing, who saw the need for proper representative governance within our land. It is from her wisdom and grace that the Assembly was founded, and it is her vision which we have followed for all these years. Let me remind you all of her words in her parting address, that 'a pony can not move without all of its hooves working in unison.' Those words stand as true today as they did then. Without unity, without all of us coming together and putting our difference aside, we will fall flat upon our muzzles.\n\n Now I know there are some here today who seek to steer us away from our course. To set us down a brand new path, one wrought with violence and danger. Though I admire the fire in these ponies hearts, I would be a foal if I did not point out that down their purposed paths lies little more than ruin. They make many promises, from reclaiming our lands to restoring our pride. Yet those methods which they advocate for, to turn our backs on all that has gotten us this far, would surely destroy us far quicker than any raider gang could.\n\n So I plead with you all to make the right choice today. We can and will prosper as one united people, if you would all just continue to put your faith and trust in me. Thank you.'"

 LIT_event.42.d:0 "'Hello everpony! You all already know me, Skybreaker of Lightning Point. It is there that I grew up, and it is there that I first beheld the splendors of magic.'\n\n A quiet grumbling could be heard across the crowd, who seemed just as disinterested in Skybreaker's ideas as they had for each and every Assembly before this. The stallion himself glanced around nervously, before changing tone completely.\n\n 'Do you all not see the danger we are in!? Our neighbors are bloodthirsty, their weapons sharp, and their guns ready! If we do not take action, and take it now, we shall be doomed to become nothing more than a pile of gory remains!'\n\n The unexpected vigor was quick to grab the audiences attention, and every eye was now focused intently on the pony before them.\n\n 'Speaker Shake Spar says we can just continue on as we always have, as if we could just ignore the world around us. Look around! You don't even have to go beyond our own borders to find our enemies, ponies who would destroy our very way of life. If you would just give me a chance, just let me put my ideas into practice, you will see that all of our problems could be solved with ease. Just give me the chance to fix everything and you'll see miracles made real.'"

 LIT_event.43.d:0 "'Howdy. Now, wasn't that cute? I had no idea little Skybreaker had so much passion within him. If only he half as much brains, he would see that we aren't his enemies. Let me ask y'all, where has the oh so wise and benevolent leadership of Shake gotten us so far? Did it avenge the Thunder-War? Did it prevent our ponies from turning on one another, leaving our nation broken and divided? It seems not, otherwise I wouldn't be up here today.\n\n I can tell ya with full confidence that I can avenge the Thunder-War within a year. Hell, I could unify all of Appleloosa within just a few years! Just give me the reins and let me do what I do best, and you'll be amazed to see how much our nation could prosper. Our fear of griffons will become nothing but a distant faded memory, and I'll make sure that we stand as the strongest nation this side of the Azureway! So, what do ya folks say? Want to forge a better future?'"

 LIT_event.44.d:0 "Stepping next to Hook Hoof, Swift Storm began to speak. 'Yes, for it is that future that we all dream! One of prosperity, of might, and of a better world for us all! What better goal could we hope to aspire to than that of improving the quality of life for our ponies, and our ponies alone? Come now, my brothers and sisters, come and join us in this just cause! For the future shall be bright, with our nation shining even brighter as a beacon of greatness across the entirity of the Wasteland! Who will stand with us, who will show the bravery and courage necessary to step hoof on a new path towards a greater world?'\n\n The ponies surrounding him, notably all pegasi, cheered at his words. As did many of the pegasi representatives present at the Assembly, though representatives from other tribes were far more subdued. \n\n 'Now, we shall leave you all with a choice. What will you choose? A future of stagnation, with nothing in store for us but a slow and terrible death? A future of uncertainty, turning to magic and technology in a desperate attempt to ward off our enemies? Or will you choose a better future, one where everypega- everypony will live happy and carefree, without having to worry about the horrors of the Wasteland? The choice is up to you."

 LIT_event.45.d:0 "The many representatives from all across the Lightning Scavengers argued and debated with one another for hours, testing the merit of the radical new ideas being proposed. Shake Spar merely watched as all this went on, confident that they would see sense at the end of the day. After all, he knew that everypony present was as stubborn as a mule, and that they would never give up the old traditions.\n\n However, the situation was nowhere near as certain as he had hoped. Already, a concerning number of representatives were throwing their support behind the Revanchists, falling for their promises of restoring the Lightning Scavenger's pride. Even more concerningly, many of the older and more conservative members of the Assembly were discussing the merit of giving that upstart, Skybreaker, a chance. As the hours dragged on, it became clear that the Assembly would not be unified behind any one canidate.\n\n Finally, the matter was called to vote. With a simple show of hooves, the Assembly decided that the Speaker would be..."

 LIT_event.5.t:0 "The New Administration"
 LIT_event.5.d:0 "Ever since the failed war against the Ministry, the Lightning Scavengers have existed in a state of complete disarray. The Assembly had devolved to little more than a game of shouting between those few representatives who still attended, with the majority of settlements and tribes having withdrawn from the institution altogether. The future seemed bleak, and an overall sense of dread hung in the air across the land.\n\n Today, all of that changed. A decree has been sent out across the land from Minister [MAS.GetName], granting recognition to the limited autonomy of the Lightning Scavengers. This new autonomous government will be lead by none other than Skybreaker, who has been an outspoken advocate of working with our new occupiers since they first marched into our lands.\n\n Many ponies see working with our enemies to be a betrayal of all of our ideals, but Skybreaker insists that it is for the best that we get along with our new benevolent patrons. As disagreeable as that idea may be, we are unfortunately left with little choice at the present time."
 LIT_event.5.a:0 "Nothing to be done about it"
 
 LIT_event.6.t:0 "The Tables Have Turned"
 LIT_event.6.d:0 "Today, a call for celebration has gone out across the land. [ROOT.GetLeader] has even decreed a national holidy to celebrate our glorious victory against the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. We lived in fear of them, both due to their unknown nature and the threat they posed to us. Now though, we are finally free of that fear and uncertainty. With their ominous presence removed from the Wasteland, our existence has been secured for yet another day.\n\n As for their lair of dread, Stable 49, it has been brought under our firm hoof. Those who resisted integration into our nation have been dealt with, though they were thankfully few in number. The majority of the Ministry's former population has proven willing to cooperate with us, so long as we prove willing to continue to allow them to live as they always have.\n\n Already, this cooperation has born fruit, as many of the Ministry's top scientists have become our own. Their expertise will prove useful in the years to come."
 LIT_event.6.a:0 "A relic of a bygone age put to rest."
 
 LIT_event.7.t:0 "A Message from the Weather Factory"
 LIT_event.7.d:0 "The tribals and scavengers to the south have surprised us with a diplomatic envoy today. It seems that they have grown tired of the barbarism and brutality of the Wasteland, instead seeking the patronage of a more civilized and proper society to lead them forward into the future. And what society could be more civilized than us? With our advanced technology, vast understanding of the arcane, and sophisticated ways, we are the natural pick for any nation looking for a saviour.\n\n Their diplomat, a surprisingly sharply dressed and well-spoken young stallion by the name of Skybreaker, has spoken to us of a brighter future for both our nations. One where his backwards ponies can seek true enlightenment, being uplifted and turned into something greater. At the same time, we would benefit from having a great deal of control over their nation, and all the benefits that would bring. To sweeten the deal even further, he has offered us land as well.\n\n Though some wonder if we should be so willing to work with a Wastelander, especially one who promises so much. Many within our ranks warn that this deal is far too good to be true, and that we can not trust this stallion to uphold his word on anything. However, the choice of whether or not to accept this offer is ultimaely up to [ROOT.GetLeader]."

 LIT_event.8.t:0 "Our New Patron"
 LIT_event.8.d:0 "Skybreaker returned to his home and makeshift office within Lightning Point for what would be the last time. He would be soon moving all of his belongings to his new home to the south, and his hometown would find itself turned over to the Ministry. He couldn't help but to feel a small stab of sorrow at the thought, as there was little telling how his quaint home would find itself transformed under the rule of his new patrons.\n\n Putting such sad thoughts aside, he turned to signing off on the last of the missives to be sent out. There was little time to waste on sentimentalism when there was so much work to be done. Each and every tribe and town had to be made aware of the new arrangement that they would now enjoy with their wise and benevolent Ministrial overlords, and all dissenting voices had to be addressed or otherwise dealt with. The future was a bright one, but there was still a long ways to go to reach it."
 LIT_event.8.a:0 "A future of servitude."
 
 LIT_event.9.t:0 "Skybreaker's Failure"
 LIT_event.9.d:0 "Skybreaker's desk was a mess, overfilling with both letters and his own hastily scribbled ideas. Sure, the Ministry refused to grant him their backing, but surely the situation could still be salvaged. A different patron could be found, a different path of upliftment could be established. [RED.GetLeader], maybe? Or perhaps the Steel Rangers. Yes, the Steel Rangers could be trusted! And they had power armour!\n\n His panicked and rapid thoughts were brought to a halt by a pounding on his door. Eyes wide in fear, Skybreaker did little more than stare. The pounding grew in intensity, inciting the stallion to cower under his desk, which is where he would remain as his rather pitiful old door was torn off its ancient hinges.\n\n A group of armed soldiers made their way into the room, briefly scanning it before spotting the pony they were here for. One of them, a particularly burly stallion that brought thoughts of danger to Skybreaker's mind, stepped forward and began to shout at his prone form.\n\n 'Former Speaker Skybreaker! As per the ruling of the Assembly, and with the approval of Speaker Shake Spar, you are to be arrested for treason against our nation! We ask that you come quietly to face justice.'\n\n Skybreaker did not move a muscle, still trying to process how it had all gone so wrong. The soldiers only gave him a few moments before forcefully dragging him out from under his desk and out the door."
 LIT_event.9.a:0 "Now we can return to normal."
 
 LIT_event.10.t:0 "The Scavengers' Gift"
 LIT_event.10.d:0 "It's so hard to find able-bodied servants nowadays. Thankfully, our faithful allies to the south have proven more than willing to provide their own ponies. All they ask in exchange is some simplistic technology, that which is already mundane and everyday to us. To see their ignorant faces light up in awe as they behold our most basic luxuries is truly an exeprience, one which both reminds us of just how far above these ponies we are and how we are doing a great thing by uplifting them. Perhaps some day they will even understand the joys of lightswitches and running water. For now though, they merely wish to understand the inner mechanisms of guns and automations, as would be expected of Wastelanders like them."
 LIT_event.10.a:0 "A great deal."
 
 LIT_event.11.t:0 "One in a Million"
 LIT_event.11.d:0 "Over the past two centuries, the ruins of Cloudsdale have been picked clean of most things of value. Unfortunately for us, there was little value to be found in the seemingly endless number of fallen aircraft that dotted the land. Many of them actively leaked radiation, creating a hazard for anypony brave enough to pick through them, and few had any hope of ever being restored to functionality. As a result, they often went overlooked by all but the most tenacious of scavengers.\n\n However, it would seem that perhaps we were overly dismissive of such wreckage. Today, under a short layer of rubble, a young scavenger came across a remarkable find: An almost fully intact cloudship, one of truly immense proportions. Unfortunately, it's cloud generators are shot to the point that it will has no hope of ever flying again.\n\n0 Despite this, it still holds great value for us, both in the vast usable materials that could come of it and the great insight we could have into the inner workings of Equestria's greatest war machines. What should we do with this flying titan?"

Normally, we wouldn't care much about a bunch of Wastelanders killing another bunch of Wastelanders, except it seems that this settlement is a trading hub for the south and held in generally high regard by much of the Wasteland. We would rather not attract the ire of a horde of barbarians, if we can at all help it.\n\n On the other hoof, we would also stand to benefit from this conquest. We could always use more land and resources to help fuel our efforts. \n\n There's also the matter of how the Lightning Scavengers would react. It may sour relations if we were to turn down their request, though we're certain they would get over it soon enough. After all, they've proven reasonable and rational enough to see the wisdom in our rulership.\n\n So, shall we grant them our approval?"

Finally, anger.\n\n The poor guards outside Skybreaker's office was the only one beholden to his angry ranting. 'Do they think this is a joke?

 LIT_event.15.d:0 "With the dust settled and the war over, we are now free to enjoy the fruits of our labour. A generous deal of land, free and available for our unicorns to move into and develop! However, there is a teensy tiny holdup... \n\n It seems that the Lightning Scavengers are under the misguided impression that they conquered New Appleloosa for themselves, rather than for us. They have even gone so far as to issue a statement of cooperation with our plan to transition the land and resources over to them in a timely fashion, as if there were no other alternative. Of course, we are hesitant to give up anything to them. After all, was it not by our hooves that New Appleloosa fell? Regardless, we may have little choice if we want to maintain good relations with our faithful subject."

 LIT_event.16.t:0 "The Day of Unity"
 LIT_event.16.d:0 "Skybreaker stood proudly before the gathered crowd, the banners of the Ministry flying proudly to either side of him. This was truly a great day, one that would go down in history as the day of salvation for the Lightning Scavengers. What was once a loose coalition had evolved into something so much grander, uplifted by their betters to join a more civilized world. At the impatient glares of the Ministry's representatives, Skybreaker stepped forward and began his speech.\n\n 'Hello, my ponies. For years, you have suffered and died in this cruel harsh world. A world devoid of even the smallest ounce of hope and rife with endless amounts of danger. Now, we have ascended beyond that. We have left behind the burdens of the wastes, and have instead embraced the beacon of civilization! Thanks to the support and backing of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences, we have been allowed to go beyond our primitive selves and become something far greater! And today, I am proud to announce that we shall be taking that one final step on this long plan towards a better future; We shall be joining the Ministry, in all ways. All ponies of this great nation are to become ponies of the Ministry, for we are all one unified nation!'\n\n This brought about limited cheering from the assembled crowd, with a distinct lack of enthusiasm in the air. The Ministry's attending personnel were quick to take note of this, scowls developing on several of their faces. However, it didn't matter if these ponies loved them. All they had to do was accept their rule."
 LIT_event.16.a:0 "Skybreaker's plans, accomplished."
 
 LIT_event.17.t:0 "An Unexpected Ultimatum"
 LIT_event.17.d:0 "Today, a letter from the Lightning Scavengers arrived. The contents of it were anything but pleasant, as it seems our once faithful subject has grown far more confident than is healthy. They have demanded that we return their northern territories, with the threat of war should we refuse. Who do they think they are? A band of filthy disgusting Wastelanders, incapable of understanding the mechanisms of even a simple lightswitch without our guidance! However, we can not deny that even a village idiot may be rendered deadly should they have a gun in their hooves. Are the lives we would lose worth putting these upstarts in their place, or should we simply concede to their demand?"
 LIT_event.17.a:0 "A war could be costly."

 LIT_event.18.t:0 "A Note of Rejection"
 LIT_event.18.d:0 "Today, our generous request for an alliance to the Plainsraiders has been answered. They have rejected our offer, citing a desire to stay out of our wars. This is a great disappointment, but we will manage just fine without them."

 LIT_event.19.t:0 "The Lightning Envoy"
 LIT_event.19.d:0 "Today, a rather odd envoy arrived from the lands to the west. The envoy consisted of not just one, but rather two different ponies. One, an earth pony. The other, a pegasus. They spent nearly as much time arguing with eachother as they did trying to convince us of their proposal, with no less than three hoof fights breaking out between the two diplomats over the course of their meeting with [ROOT.GetLeader].\n\n Though the fine details were lost in the brawling and bickering, it seems that the Lightning Scavengers are now seeking an alliance with us. They have often been our foe throughout history, making this a highly unexpected proposal. However, it seems that they believe we can leave all of our problems in the past and come together to appreciate what truly matters: hating griffons. Together, we can drive the birdbrains out of the lands to the north, putting an end to the threat they pose to the region once and for all.\n\n Should we accept this offer, or leave them to their own affairs?"

 LIT_event.20.t:0 "Chaos in the Streets"
 LIT_event.20.d:0 "Featherbrush stands defeated, we stand victorious, and all that's left to do now is rejoice. Or that would be all that was left, if not for the evergrowing tensions between Hook Hoof's forces and the Enclavists reaching a boiling point.\n\n Without the goal of reclaiming our lands to unify them, the two factions of the Revanchist Coalition have rapidly devolved into fighting one another. Smoke fills the strees across the nation, as the fighting continues to escalate. Hook Hoof has already fortified his position within the Crooked Bloatsprite, from which he coordinates his side. Though he would normally be hideously outnumbered, he has found his forces bolstered greatly by ponies who simply wish to oppose Swift Storm's pro-pegasi policies.\n\n Meanwhile, Swift Storm has rallied pegasi all across the nation to his side. His forces firmly hold the skies, often launching surprise assaults on the ponies down below. A large force was already being gathered to deal with Hook Hoof directly and a final confrontation between the two sides has been made inevitable."
 LIT_event.20.a:0 "Who will win out?"
 
 LIT_event.21.t:0 "An Envoy at the Gates"
 LIT_event.21.d:0 "It was a normal day within Neighvarro. The ever-present hum of the shield generators was only interrupted by the faint shouting of the drill sergeant, as he found yet another soldier out of uniform. It had become a common problem, thanks in large part to the outpost only being sent the dregs and washouts nowadays.\n\n The relative monotony of the day was interrupted by a large commotion outside the outer-shield. A large group of spectators had gathered, watching as a filthy and sickly pegasus argued with an unfortunate officer.\n\n 'And I'm telling you, I need this missive delivered up to New Cloudsdale at once!' The less groomed of the two pegasi shouted at the officer before him. The officers response, carrying a tinge of annoyance, followed. 'And I'm telling you, a bunch of Surface-loving Dashites are of no concern to us! Now, if you don't get out of my bucking sight, I will order you vaporized.'\n\n The rapidly-escalating argument was interrupted only by the intervention of an officer featuring quite a lot more flair to his uniform. The lower ranking officer was quick to explain the situation to his superior, though not without 'corrections' from the other pegasus. It would seem that the Surface-born pegasus hailed from a petty nation calling themselves the Lightning Scavengers. They had a sizable population of pegasi, and it seemed they wished to join the Enclave above.\n\n The leadership back in New Cloudsdale would no doubt embrace having a close pegasus ally on the Surface, for one reason or another. However, they would no doubt approve all sorts of costly operations to help out this ally, sacrificing proper pegasi blood and Neighvarro's already dwindling budget for the sake of a bunch of primitive half-breeds. Of course, they could always just never hear of these wanna-be pegasi from down below..."

 LIT_event.22.d:0 "Wonderful news has come to us today! The great city of New Cloudsdale has agreed to accept us with open hooves, welcoming us into the Greater Enclave. In even better news, they have already sent down some of their skilled personnel to evaluate our nation and aid us in behaving as proper pegasi should. The future is bright for us, and for the Enclave as a whole."
 LIT_event.22.a:0 "We're all family."
 
 LIT_event.23.t:0 "Neighvarro's Betrayal"
 LIT_event.23.d:0 "Terrible news has been delivered to us. The city of New Cloudsdale has not responded to our request for entry into the Enclave, which can only mean one thing: They care not for our plight. This has led to the motives of our government and our goals being widely questioned across our land. With the situation growing rapidly more unstable and our nation growing even further divided, there is only one question left to ask..."
 LIT_event.23.a:0 "...what now?"
 
 LIT_event.24.t:0 "Swift Storm's Speech"
 LIT_event.24.d:0 "The gathered crowd argued and shouted among themselves. Rationalizations and suggestions were being thrown wildly about, with ideas ranging from simply trying to approach New Cloudsdale again to more radical ideas such as engineering a bioweapon to wipe out the entire above-cloud pegasus race. This later suggestion came from a rather disheveled stallion who found little support from the crowd around him. The ongoing debates would only be halted by the entrance of Swift Storm, who waited patiently for all eyes to turn towards him before he began to speak.\n\n 'My fellow pegasi, we have come far. We have struggled, fought, and even died for our most noble cause. And finally, after all of our efforts, we were at the cusp of our salvation. Only for it to be taken from us, stolen like candy from a foal. We have been denied our rightful place in the sky, denied our very birth right! Why, I hear many of you ask, why would such a thing occur? How could it occur? Why, isn't it obvious?'\n\n At the blank stares of his audience, Swift Storm continued.\n\n 'The answer is simple: Our sky-born brothers and sisters, those who are of the purest of blood and upbringing... have been corrupted. Subverted. Overtaken by decadence and degeneracy, the likes of which plague this blasted Wasteland! Their rulers are not the mares and stallions of purity that they claim to be, but rather horrific mixed-blood monstrosities that merely wear the pegasus form like a disguise. And it is our duty... neigh, our destiny to rid them of such corruption. It shall not be them bringing us salvation, but rather us delivering unto them their own salvation!'\n\n An enthusiastic stomping of hooves met his statements, as Swift Storm began issuing orders at every pegasus near him. There was much work to be done, but the Enclave would be purified. He would make sure of it."

 LIT_event.25.t:0 "The End of Our Struggle"
 LIT_event.25.d:0 "We have done it!\nThe streets of New Cloudsdale run with the blood of the traitors that led the Neighvarro Enclave down their dark path.\nThe last pockets of resistance surrendered early this morning, most of them seeming elated that the nightmare under the military government was finally over.\nIn a hasty inauguration ceremony, Swift Storm has been officially recognized as the leader of the Cloudsdale Enclave, which has been declared a legitimate part of the Grand Pegasus Enclave.\nFirst Citizen Brightwing was one of the few politicians from other Enclave cities to have attended the inauguration, giving a short speech in which he congratulated the fighters of the Liberation Army, and promised that Skyfreeze would help in rebuilding their economy.\nSchedules are already being drawn up for the Senate to reconvene properly, and new elections to take place, though this is likely still months away.\nThousands of citizens can now finally lay down their arms and embrace their kin, as the time when we fought eachother is over, and a new era of peace and prosperity dawns for the Enclave!"

 LIT_event.26.t:0 "Volunteers From Unknown Skies"
 LIT_event.26.d:0 "Early this morning, several dozen wings of Enclave pegasi were sighted on the approach to Cloudsdale.\nWhile panic of a possible attack by the traitors of Neighvarro swept the city at first, it quickly became clear that these were not enemies, and in fact not even pegasi from Neighvarro!\nThey introduced themselves as the 'Cloudsdale Volunteer Division', and are intent on supporting us in our fight against the military dictatorship that has taken hold of New Cloudsdale.\nTheir leader carried a letter, penned by a certain 'First Citizen Brightwing', the pegasus in charge of the Skyfreeze Enclave.\nThe letter informs Swift Storm that while the other Enclave cities can't openly support a war against Neighvarro, most of them would be happy to support the True Enclave Liberation Army covertly, and help us restore the proper civilian government in New Cloudsdale.\nThe Letter also informed us about a group of undercover Enclave scientists that will enter our territory in the coming days, and are supposed to teach us how to construct X01 power armour. With such advanced equipment at our side, nothing could stand against us!\nLastly, it wishes us the best of luck in our war, with Brightwing hoping to meet Swift Storm face to face once the Liberation is complete."

 LIT_borderwar_event.2.d:0 "We have not only failed to retake our former lands, but we have been pushed back and repulsed by the griffon forces. This defeat has been nothing short of embarrassing for our government, eroding much of the faith put in us. There's always next time though, right?"

 POLITICS_SHAKE_SPAR_DESC:0 "Born to an unassuming family of scavengers living within the Thunderous Fields to the north, Shake Spar has been a part of the Lightning Scavnegers for his entire life. His entry into politics wouldn't come until later on in his life, following his career in the late Thunderous Warband and their defeat in the Thunder-War. With the humiliating defeat within the public conscious, Shake Spar would rise to power on promises of reform and centralization. Ironically, he would go on to become commonly viewed as a representative of the status-quo and conservative values.\n\nHe enjoys a great deal of support from the majority of the Assembly, especially from the elders of the various tribes around the region, which his hooves-off policies have made him popular among. These same policies have also been a constant source of criticism levied against his leadership, with his opposition decrying his reign as ineffective. The rise of radicalism across the nation seems to prove their point, though only time will tell if Shake Spar can continue to guide his country into the future."
 
 POLITICS_SKYBREAKER_DESC:0 "Skybreaker of Lightning Point. An unassuming stallion of short stature with an equally unassuming upbringing, few could of predicted Skybreaker's rise to power. His own hometown expected him to follow in his parents hoofsteps, tending to the family farm and selling what little excess produce they could grow to get by. He would defy these expectations by insteading pursuing the field of technoarcane repair, first as a hobby and later as a career. He would quickly become widely popular within his settlement for establishing small-scale generators across the town, getting a series of automated turrets operational to defend the town, and introducing many of the local businesses to the useful nature of terminals.\n\n These accomplishments would cement him as a pillar of the community and would ultimately lead to him taking the position of mayor after the death of his precessor. Since then, the engineer-turned-politician has spent most of his time preaching about the wonders of both magic and technology across the nation. As his popularity as grown, so too has his ambition."
 
 POLITICS_SWIFT_STORM_DESC:0 "Swift Storm's ancestors were once very prominent members of the Cloudsdale survivors, being directly involved in the formation of the Assembly along with the foundation of many of the settlements across the Lightning Scavenger's territory. In a twist of irony, their descendant seeks to destroy the ideal of racial harmony and replace it with pegasus supremacy. In his view, there are only two types of peoples: Pegasi and everyone else.\n\n It's hard to pinpoint the exact root of Swift Storm's views. Perhaps it was from him growing up in a community comprised almost entirely of pegasi, or from witnessing the brutality of the primarily earthpony Warbands. Regardless of the original reason, these views would be made much stronger by the loss in the Thunder-War. In his eyes, the War was irrefutable evidence that the Lightning Scavenger's ideals had failed, that the groundbound ponies within their nation were naturally weak and inferior creatures. Such would give rise to his political movement, the so-called 'Enclavists'."
 
 POLITICS_HOOK_HOOF_DESC:0 "Nopony could of predicted that Hook Hoof would be the leader of anything even remotely resembling a civilized nation. The ex-warlord was once one of the most feared and renown raiders within the Appleloosan region. The scorched ruins of former settlements still litter the land along the Azureway's eastern bank, burnt-out monuments to the brutality and might of Hook Hoof.\n\n Those days are long behind him though. After amassing more wealth and soldiers than most small nations, the fearsome raider declared his army disbanded and retired to a quiet life as a bar owner. Most of his former raiders either followed their leader or joined up with other raider gangs in the area. Since then, the name Hook Hoof has slowly faded into obscurity.\n\n As for the stallion himself, he spends near all of his days within his bar, the Crooked Bloatsprite. Distilling and selling alcohol has become his livlihood, a career that he has expressed a great deal of contentment with. Indeed, he likely never would of gone into politics at all if not for the crippling defeat in the Thunder-War. This event sparked something within Hook Hoof, leading to him calling for a new movement across the nation. The Lightning Scavengers had been rendered weak by their previous period of relative stability and peace. This weakness would be the end of them if they did not change their course.\n\n Now, he stands as the strongest stallion within the nation. Under his reign, the Lightning Scavengers shall avenge all of the old wrongs and reclaim those lands that are rightfully theirs. For the Scavengers! For Hook Hoof!"
 
 lit_insaneskybreaker_desc:0 "King Skybreaker had accomplished more in a few short years than most ponies did in an entire lifetime. His backwards and primitive nation had been forcibly civilized and dragged into a new age, despite any protests against the matter. It was with his brilliance and wise leadership that they were shown the light of modernity, forced to abandon the traditions that had held them back for so long.\n\n It would also be his efforts which led to the adoption of more beneficial traditions. A new hierarchy and a new order had been established, based off of those which had been tried and tested for thousands of years. Monarchs had reigned since even before the Founding of Equestria, in a system of government that had been proven to work. Within this system, his nation would thrive for a thousand years."
 
 lit_insaneswiftstorm_desc:0 "Within a sky full of degeneracy and decadence, one pegasus stands alone as a beacon of purity. Untainted by the filth that infests the world today, the incorruptable Swift Storm seeks to purify his own race. Subversives and degenerates control one of the Enclave's most sacred cities, reigning over the misguided and ignorant masses. The only way to save the pegasus race is to remove these corrupting elements. Soon, all pegasi shall recognize their hero and savior. For he is their only hope for salvation!"

LIT_flavorevent.1.t:0 "The Assembly Gathers"
LIT_flavorevent.1.d:0 "Elders, mayors, and warlords alike all gathered within the biannual Assembly. This most sacred institution served as the supreme power of the land, at least in theory, and provided representation to every faction within the Lightning Scavengers. Those gathered represented all races, creeds, and backgrounds within the nation, providing the most comprehensive representation of the population possible.\n\n The gathered ponies quieted as Speaker Shake Spar gave his introductory speech. It was the same speech as every Assembly, welcoming the representatives and reminding them of the history and ideals of their nation. Even before his speech reached it's end, the many gathered ponies began to whisper and chat among themselves. Ideas were being purposed, deals were being made, and the game of politics was being played by all present.\n\n The networking, plotting, and debating was interrupted by one particular representative calling for attention. Mayor Skybreaker called out to the gathered ponies in a move that had long ago become routine. He had done the same in the last Assembly, and the Assembly before that, and for many Assemblies across the years. The call was always the same one, to replace the current acting Speaker with a more qualified one. The pony posessing said qualifications of course being the stallion himself, who could save them from their current path of decay and bring technoarcane enlightenment to all ponies.\n\n As usual, Skybreaker failed to muster enough to support to actually call for an election. Shake Spar did little more than shake his head at the display. At one point, he had welcomed the challenge as an exciting shakeup to the normally boring Assembly. However, it has grown increasingly tedious over time, now being just as unexciting as everything else that went on here. With his challenge out of the way, the standard politcal procedure continued. The arguing and debating would go on for most of the day, without anything of any real substance being accomplished. Such was how the Assembly went."

LIT_flavorevent.2.d:0 "Skybreaker was sitting at his desk in Lightning Point, head in hooves and a headache pounding at the back of his skull. He had failed in yet another Assembly, allowing Shake Spar to continue his ineffective reign. So long as that damned stallion was in charge, their nation would experience nothing more than a slow decline followed by a quick death. Such was their fate if nothing changed.\n\n Why couldn't they see? Were they blind, physically unable to grasp that which always pressed upon Skybreaker's mind? The future was a cruel one, but it didn't have to be so. Through science and magic alike, they could ascend to become something greater! Their petty backwards nation could modernize, industrialize, and ultimately grow into a modern society. All they had to do was trust in him, to put their faith in them like his own town had for so long.\n\n Yet they did not. No matter how bad the situation grew, no matter how unstable the nation became, they still refused to even give him a chance. He used to believe in the importance and sanctity of the Assembly in being a stablizing force across the land, but time and experience had since proven otherwise. So long as those foals were in charge, they would be content to let their country burn around them.\n\n Someday, he would get his chance. It might not be this year, the year after, or even the many years after that. He will keep trying though, until he finally gets his day in the sun. When that time finally comes, he will remember all those who stood against him for so long."

Well, alright then, if ya insist.\n\n Yeah, it hits hard, don't it? So, what brings ya here to this fine establishment. Lookin' for the Revanchists, are ya? Well, this is the right place. Where're my manners, I ain't even introduced myself yet! I'm Hook Hoof, owner of the Crooked Bloatsprite and leader of the Revanchists. Pleasure to meet ya.\n\n Yeah, I know I ain't what you expected. I think you'll find that most of my colts ain't the most civilized of folk. Don't let that put ya off though. We're all here 'cause we care about our country and want to see it prosper. Those beaked bastards took our land, fucked us in the plot, and didn't even have the common courtesy to give us a reach around! That just ain't right, but those high and fancy politicians over in the Assembly did nothing but complain about it.\n\n Now, don't get me wrong. I ain't got nothing against the Assembly, per say. What I do have something against is sitting by and letting a bunch of oversized chickens push us around. We need to take action, we need to show them that we can't just be pushed around, and we need to remind the Wasteland that the Lightning Scavengers are more than just a bunch of ignorant tribals.\n\n Are ya alright, fella? Come on, this way, we need to get ya outside before ya throw up all over my floor.'"

LIT_flavorevent.4.t:0 "Swift Storm's Rally"
LIT_flavorevent.4.d:0 "'My brothers and sisters! It is not just a common cause that binds us, that makes us all one within this struggle. Neigh, it is much more than ideology that unites us as one! It is the shared blood of our heritage, our common ancestry that unites us. We are not like the groundborn, those who live far below. Our blood is the blood of the sky, the very same sky that is our birthright and our destiny. Come now, pegasi of Cloudsdale! Come now, and aid me in bringing salvation to our race! Only by mending the old divide, by removing that barrier which has been wedged between our own race, can we ever hope to achieve a better world for all pegasi. The Enclave, that mighty institution of pegasus ideals, shall welcome us as their own. We shall once more fly as one race, one people, one Enclave!'\n\n The stomping of hooves and strong flapping of wings created a grand applause. This might not of been his best speech, but it did serve it's purpose of reminding his followers just what they were fighting for. Turning behind him and walking off stage, the leader of the Enclavists left his faithful ponies to talk among themselves and reinforce eachothers belief in the cause.\n\n As he stepped into the backroom of his cloudbuilt rallying hall, Swift Storm quickly noticed the presence of another stallion. The ever vigilant Glassfeather, a well-respected pegasus within his field and a great boon to the movement. Taking note of the sober expression on his compatriots face, Swift Storm prepared himself for bad news.\n\n 'Mr. Storm. You know, I have tried my hardest to rally those pegasi within the Assembly to our side. However, I am afraid that many of them are hesitant to join our cause. We simply don't have enough support to even dream of getting rid of that bastard Shake Spar.'\n\n This news was, as expected, bad. They needed support within the Assembly more than anywhere else. If they couldn't even count on the unanimous support of the pegasi... they were left with little choice. They would have to go for the backup plan.\n\n 'Glass. I'm going to need to ask a favor of you. I have a sealed letter, in the third drawer in my office. Take it and bring it to Hook Hoof. We will have our support, one way or another.'"

LIT_flavorevent.5.t:0 "Shaking Hooves With the Enemy"
LIT_flavorevent.5.d:0 "Swift Storm's entrance was a loud and spectacular one, with patriotic Wartime music playing and several pegasi barded in the Enclavists iconic uniforms marching in alongside him. This was in stark contrast to the dimly lit bar that they found themselves in, which was occupied by only a small hooffull of rough individuals who didn't care in the slightest for the fanfare. One particularly burly stallion in the corner began to angrily trot towards the winged noisemakers, but a simple shake of the head from the bartender was enough to halt him in his tracks.\n\n 'Well, ya certainly made sure to let me know that yer here. Half the town too. What can I get ya to drink?' Hook Hoof's offer of liquor, which was a very generous offer in his opinion, was ignored as the leader of the pegasus procession eyed him up.\n\n 'I don't have time for pleasure, I'm afraid. There's a lot that needs to be done, and not enough time in the day to do it. So, tell me, what are your terms?'\n\n Swift's impatience brought a small chuckle out of the bartender. Typical pegasi, always wanting to go fast in everything they do. He was tempted to draw this meeting out as long as he could, so as to better cut into their precious time. However, some of his regulars didn't appreciate their guests, so it would be best to finish this up quickly.\n\n 'My terms? My terms are as simple as can be. Ya promise to support us in getting rid of Shake Spar, and we promise our support in kind. Once he's gone, we deal with the oversized chickens to the north. After that? Who knows.\n\n Surprised by the simplicity of the agreement, Swift Storm took a moment to formulate a response. 'Well, if that's it then... that seems agreeable. Let's consider it a deal.'\n\n A rather lackluster ending to a rather lackluster meeting. The pegasi were quick to vacate the bar, while it's owner simply went back to tending the bar. Within just a few short minutes, an alliance had been made that could shake the entire nation to it's roots."

LIT_flavorevent.6.t:0 "The Forced Election"
LIT_flavorevent.6.d:0 "Emergency Assemblies were rare occurences, generally only called during times of crisis. The only way for one to occur was for either the current Speaker or a majority of current Assembly representatives to call for it. It was therefore a great surprise to many when letters went out to all active representatives, informing them that an Emergency Assembly was being called through majority vote. The topic of this Assembly was an even more surprising one: An election was being held to select a new Speaker. Such was not unheard of, but the removal of a Speaker outside of the standard Assemblies was exceedingly rare. Indeed, the only time within the Lightning Scavengers history that such had happened was the removal of Shake Spar's predecessor, following the embarassing defeat in the Thunder-War.\n\n As for Shake Spar himself, he was livid. The so-called Revanchist Coalition had managed to operate under his nose, getting far more support than he ever would of thought possible. However, they were fully within the boundaries of the common law. No action could be taken against them, at least not before he reaffirmed his own leadership. He would just have to ride this Assembly out and hope that he could convince the representatives of his merit. He would have to fight his hardest to prevent radicals from seizing control of his nation."

LIT_flavorevent.7.d:0 "Blackmane had seen a lot of guns in his time. He was a bit of a gun expert, knowing all of the ins and outs of every weapon from the ancient muskets to the most advanced Wartime tech. That being said, he had never seen a weapon quite like these 'Mag-X' rifles.\n\n The weapon before him was of an odd and relatively fragile make. He certainly wouldn't trust it to hold as a blunt weapon. It also emitted an odd purple glow, a characteristic that he found almost creepy. They took no ammo, instead containing a recharger of some sort. Their projectile was a bolt of pure magic, capable of punching through armor and flesh with equal ease. They were just as unnatural as they appeared.\n\n Now, these unusual weapons were being issued to every Warband across the nation. The local one had taken to coming to him for repairs, as these guns seemed to run into issues often. Though he was limited in what he could fix internally, any structural damage could be fixed up easily enough. These things had an odd tendency to blow holes in the side of their barrel. They would also occasionally explode in the users hooves, though that was well beyond his ability to repair.\n\n He couldn't complain too much though. After all, the unreliable nature of these guns brought him quite a lot of business."

LIT_flavorevent.8.t:0 "The Assembly Disbanded"
LIT_flavorevent.8.d:0 "This Assembly, as always, began with an announcement from the Speaker. However, in a serious breach of tradition, the Speaker did not stand alone on the Assembly floor. Surrounding him were numerous suited unicorns, all wielding energy weapons. Even more concerningly, similarly equipped unicorns now stood guard all around the Assembly Hall.\n\n 'Everypony. I welcome you to the last Assembly. From this day hence, this outdated relic of a bygone age shall be entirely disbanded. Moving into the future, the supreme power of this land shall be invested in myself and our valued Ministry patrons.'\n\n This announcement was, as would be expected, met with outrage. Any objections would be short lived however, as one of the unicorns alongside Skybreaker fired off a bolt of magic into the air. The message was simple: The Ministry's guards weren't just for show, and any resistance would be met with force.\n\n 'Thank you all for your understanding. Now, please leave the Assembly Hall and go back to your homes. You will not be bothered further, so long as you fully cooperate with our benevolent patrons.' Following the closing remark and warning, the Speaker was escorted out by his guards. The now former representatives from across the nation would be quick to follow their leaders example and vacate the Hall, getting as far away from the armed guards as possible before daring to voice their complaints."

LIT_flavorevent.9.t:0 "Segregation For Everypony"
LIT_flavorevent.9.d:0 "Things had changed a lot for Misty Hoof since the new Speaker took power. Her town had once enjoyed a decent deal of trade, with all sorts of luxuries being available to them from all across the nation. Now, all trade was directed towards unicorn settlements instead. Very few luxuries were traded, and those that were had to be sold in the night. After all, if any word got out that a merchant was selling scarce commodities to a non-unicorn, they would be lucky if only their trading licence got revoked.\n\n Passing by a guard, the mare's thoughts went towards the benefits of Skybreaker's rule. If there was one change that was widely welcomed, it was the added protection. The guards were all distant and strictly professional, but they weren't abusive and did their best to keep the peace. The tyranny of the Warbands and the ever present threat of raiders had been rendered a distant memory.\n\n Approaching her market stall, Misty was excited to see a few unicorns in the market. It was rare for them to come around their town nowadays, but when they did, they always brought quite a few caps. Maybe they were even willing to buy some of her produce? It would be nice, but she doubted it. Very few ponies were willing to waste what few caps they had on asparagus nowadays."

LIT_flavorevent.10.t:0 "All the Way Down in Appleloosa"
LIT_flavorevent.10.d:0 "Life had changed quite a bit in New Appleloosa. Wheras before everypony was free to do their own thing so long as they respected the towns laws, now they were instead expected to always behave only as they were ordered, when they were ordered, with no exceptions. The town didn't get to enjoy the minimal privileges still afforded to those settlements within the Lightning Scavengers. Armed guards patrolled the streets at all times of day, making sure that everypony was where they should be. Only unicorns could own and go into most of the towns businesses, save for the seediest and most run down bar around. Even employment had grown scarce, with the only jobs available to non-unicorns being as menial labourers and servants.\n\n Of course, it wasn't all bad. At least the earth ponies didn't have to worry about finding a bed to sleep in or chasing their next meal. All of their essentials were provided for them by their unicorn tyrants. All they had to do was maintain a job, doing their part towards the betterment of society. Or so they were constantly told. Whether or not society was actually growing any better was a matter of great debate, as the vast majority of earth ponies would answer one way while many unicorns would answer in another."

LIT_flavorevent.11.d:0 "Night Star couldn't help but smile as he observed the bottlecap in his telekinetic grasp. The wealth continued to roll in, day and night, as customers from all around the nation came to his store. Life was certainly good for the merchant, as his bakeries business continued to boom. It seems that bread is an odd sort of luxury for the unicorns of the Ministry, leading to them paying top cap for even his blandest of bread. Not to mention the more specialty breads, which sold out almost as fast as they went on the shelves.\n\n Continuing to gaze at the cap, the unicorn wondered if he would be able to see his own reflection if he cleaned the centuries of grime off of it. Perhaps he would do so later and proudly display his shiniest bottlecap for all to see. Crime had been near erradicated within his town, so he didn't even have to worry about somepony stealing it.\n\n Though a single cap might not appear noteworthy to many, it meant quite a bit to Night. This cap, like all caps, was a symbol of prosperity. It was a symbol of harmonic living and of what everypony could accomplish if they put their mind to it. This cap, and all like it, served as a constant reminder that anypony could become wealthy in this world if they had the drive to do such. So long as they were a unicorn, of course."

LIT_flavorevent.12.d:0 "The war against the Ministry was far from pleasant, but it was regretably necessary. They had aligned themselves against the interests of the Lightning Scavengers, making them little more than just another threat to our way of life. However, they had once been valuable allies. Without their aid, we never would of ascended to the lofty heights that we occupy now.\n\n It was with this in mind that Skybreaker decided to not allow their legacy to perish. For over two centuries, the Ministry of Arcane Sciences had been dedicated to advancing ponykind through their own unique mix of magic and technology. Was that not precisely what he himself sought to do? With such a noble goal and a long legacy, it would be a shame to let a few bad eggs destroy all they had worked for.\n\n So it was decided that the Ministry would not be allowed to die here. They would live on, albeit in a new form. The Ministry of Arcane Sciences would continue to exist. Only now, they would serve the ponies of the Lightning Scavengers, rather than the other way around. For their noble goals and for the accomplishments of their forefathers, all surviving Ministry personnel would be given the opportunity to continue in their positions within the reformed Ministry. For the advancement of ponykind."

LIT_flavorevent.13.t:0 "A Lasting Legacy"
LIT_flavorevent.13.d:0 "Staring into his dimly lit lamp, Skybreaker couldn't help but to allow doubt to creep through his mind. He had accomplished much and come far, but would it last? Sure, his nation enjoyed prosperity like it never had before. Their borders had expanded substantially, their economy was booming, and they stood as a powerhouse within the Wasteland. By all accounts, his reign had been widely successful.\n\n However, the Lightning Scavengers were still a bunch of primitives. Tribes and settlements still stretched across the land, the social hierarchy still remained largely inconsistent and unrefined. Once he died, what would come of his beloved nation? Would a new Assembly be formed, regressing them back into a dark age? Would the nation collapse in on itself, being devoured by the following power vaccuum? All he had worked for, all he had accomplished, would be rendered meaningless in light of his passing.\n\n Perhaps there was a way to make it sustainable. Perhaps he could create a nation that would last for more than a single lifetime. To do so though, he would have to take extreme measures. They could not survive as they are now, as a loose federation of tribals and scavengers. They would have to become a proper nation, one founded on civilized ideals.\n\n With these thoughts flowing through his mind, Skybreaker began to draft new plans. There were letters to send out, announcements to make, and a brand new class of nobility to declare. Celestia's sun would never set upon his nation. That much, he would make sure of."

It was therefore a great surprise to many when the orders went out to conduct a great rennovation of the ancient structure. Where there had once been an open floor, there would now be a raised podium with a luxurious throne stationed upon it. The seats arranged around the Hall had been completely remade, ancient wooden benches replaced with soft cushions and stone tables. Architects had even been brought in from New Mareway, helping redesign the building itself in their nations iconic 'classical feudal' style.\n\n It was there that the most notable unicorns from across the nation would be gathered. From within that Hall, they would be declared the new noble class and informed of all of the privileges that would bring. It was also from there that Speaker Skybreaker would announce the formation of the Platnium Kingdom. He promised that this Kingdom would be one built upon the most time-tested of foundations, one built to last forever and a day. And with it, his legacy would be cemented forever within history."

LIT_flavorevent.15.d:0 "The two ponies stood before their sovereign, both confident that their arguments would persuade him. The matter at hoof was, as usual, trivial. A simple land debate between two of the nobility, arguing over a small stretch of farmland that stretched across both of their respective lands. Issues like this often led to Skybreaker wishing for the more simple times before this, when property rights were hardly a concern of the state and the issue of the day was always far more serious.\n\n He couldn't complain too much though. After all, this was the system he created. So long as the nobles remained loyal to the Crown and continued to serve the ponies under their rule, he could deal with a few minor arguments over land. Those unicorns who he sought out to become his new noble class had proven themselves to be largely good choices, as they were content to exist in their position of limited power within society. Any that expressed too much ambition had long since been crushed and cast out of the ranks of nobility. He couldn't have them threatening the social order, after all.\n\n Reaching a decision, he chose to favour one of the nobles over the other. Neither of them had any sort of particularly good claim to the land, but his choice was reportedly much better to the peasantry than his rival. If nothing else, at least the farmers would appreciate it. Assuming they paid attention or cared at all. To the earth ponies who often lived on these farms, one unicorn ruler was the same as any other.\n\n Forcing his thoughts back on track, The Platnium King turned his attention back to his court. There were still many cases to rule upon and many judgements to make, not to mention the petitions that he was expected to hear throughout the day. It was all tiring work, but it was necessary if he wished to build a nation to last."

Fortunately, the Assembly had seen sense at the end of the day and rejected the radical elements that sought to irreparably change their nation.\n\n However, he was not so foalish so as to assume that his leadership would remain unquestioned from here on. The radicals had not disappeared overnight, and even now they plotted and schemed against him. Something would have to be done and action would have to be taken.

Any effort to get even somewhat close to the building was met in failure, with several deaths and injuries to show for it. The only option left was to call up the Warbands.\n\n The Siege of the Crooked Bloatsprite had lasted little more than a hour before somepony brought out the dynamite. A coordinated push against the buildings defences had been enough to get close enough to begin chucking explosives around the walls and even through any open windows. These were seemingly effective, as the buildings supports gave way soon after and the entire structure came crashing down.\n\n Hook Hoof's corpse was found within the remains, mostly intact save for a severe fracture to his skull. As far as we can tell, the roof above him was responsible for his death, after caving it right onto him. With him dead, the Revanchist Movement has been left with no direction and his Warband has disbanded."

Our pegasus forces were nowhere near numerous enough to cover the entirity of the sky, and those pegasi we did have were of questionable loyalty when it came to arresting their own. In anticipation of these difficulties, every Warband was ordered to be on high alert and warnings were sent out across the nation to be ready for a crisis.\n\n Fortunately, it seems that we didn't have to go through all of the trouble after all. Swift Storm and his most loyal Enclavists have all fled the nation for unknown skies. While it's possible that they could come back to cause trouble at some point in the future, it seems unlikely.

His ponies looked healthier and more vibrant than ever before, faces lit up by a spark that was missing before. It was hard to believe that just a few short years ago, the Lightning Scavenger's had been on the brink of collapse. Now though, they stood proudly as a beacon of harmony and prosperity within the southern Heartland. That they had come so far in such a short time was nothing short of amazing.\n\n However, there was still work to be done. In all directions, dark clouds could be seen gathering. Whether it be the fires of Fillydelphia, the ideology of Shattered Hoof, or the fanatacism of the Enclave, one of the giants of the Wasteland would eventually come for them. When they did, they would not be met with a backwards nation of disunited savages.

With the expansion of the Lightning Scavengers land came the expansion of the Assembly, with many of the newly conquered settlements being given an opportunity to join the government in full and exert their rights as newly declared citizens. While this was great and all, it had the averse effect of making Shake Spar's headaches far worse.\n\n Even now, political factions were forming based on their old borders. Factionalism was running increasingly rampant, with most representatives joining one of the emerging parties or another. They all advocated for their own pursuits and interests over all else, much more fiercely than the old representatives ever did. The debates grew more heated in every new Assembly, as the institution rapidly grew increasingly chaotic.\n\n However, this was not yet a dangerous situation. Though each faction had plenty of devotion, none of them enjoyed anywhere near enough support to topple the others. For now, the situation would remain a gridlock. Should anypony ever grow too powerful, and should the institution of the Assembly grow threatened once more, Shake Spar would be ready to intervene.

However, their biological air superiorty gave them a massive advantage when it came to dealing with ground based targets.\n\n As the battle progressed, it tipped increasingly in favour of the pegasi above. Within just a few minutes, dozens of grounded soldiers had been slain, some turning to ash as their corpses tumbled. It was, in Swift Storm's opinion, a beautiful sight. It would serve as the perfect farewell to Hook Hoof and his degenerates, reminding them of the might of the pegasus race as they vacated the country.\n\n A single tearing sensation dragged Swift Storm away from his thoughts. His entire wing was in an odd sort of numb pain, a very unpleasant sensation. Looking down at it, he was struck stupefied by the sight of the open air. Where was his wing? Where was his wing!? Gravity quickly took effect, dragging him ever closer to the ground. Flailing in pain and panic, his other wing flew out to try to catch his weight and glide. It was to little effect, as his death plummet only grew slightly more spiral in shape.\n\n A moment later, a call went out across the Enclavist ranks. Their leader had fallen. A call for retreat quickly followed, as they fled the battle and their former nation. On the ground, a mare with an old anti-machine rifle was cheered on by her compatriots for landing the winning shot."

Indeed, the only notable diffence was the increase in customers, as loyal soldiers and groveling governors alike came to the bar to celebrate and beg, respectively. The former was always welcome, warriors who were often given drinks on the house for their heroics. The later, humored or removed depending on Hook Hoof's mood. Even here, within his own business, he could not escape the struggles of being in charge of an empire.\n\n It was worth it though, both for his country and for him. He almost felt like he was back in his prime, galloping across the Southern Heartland with his raiders, razing settlements and extorting caps everywhere they could. Though his Warbands were nowhere near as crude nowadays, the spirit of conquest was still there.\n\n While they fought and died out there, he would stay here.

Those times were long gone now.\n\n Now, they couldn't even handle the sad excuse for a federation to the south. Their Warbands had swept through Featherbrush's land like a wave, destroying any and all Talon resistance as they went. With their defeat having already come to pass, they had little choice now but to await their fate.\n\n That fate would come from a surprise visit to Featherbrush's cell from [ROOT.GetLeader].

It was an unofficial rule that blood was not to be spilled within that most sacred of institutions.\n\n Swift Storm cared little for said rule, ordering that Hook Hoof would be tried and killed there. The Assembly had been called for what many referred to as a decided trial, as Swift Storm acted as the sole judge, jury, and executioner. After reading out a rather extensive and questionably accurate list of crimes, the self-appointed Speaker declared Hook Hoof guilty of all charges. Said charges included treason, murder, conspiracy, theft, illegal sale of liquor, and overall being a troublemaker. For these crimes, he would be sentenced to death.\n\n For Hook Hoof's part, the stallion declined to plead either way on these charges, perhaps due to the cloth used to gag him. No objections were given as he was dragged out into the center of the Assembly Hall by two Enclavists, sat down for all of those gathered to see, and shot in front of them.

Meetings were constant, as many plans were being purposed and discussed for avenging the Thunder-War. This was the key topic at hoof, as it was considered the first and top priority of the ruling Coalition.\n\n Looking to his left and right, Glassfeather was struck by just how different the two factions present were. While the Enclavists were all uniformed and maintained an air of prideful professionalism, Hook Hoof and his less respectable bunch were almost laid back. They casually chatted among themselves, content to waste time socializing rather than working out a proper plan.

LIT_flavorevent.45.d:0 "Much had changed within Old Appleloosa, but in some ways nothing had changed at all. When the pegasi had first descended from above, the slavers within the region had been just as opposed to them as anypony else. Even after their official surrender, many had continued to resist the invaders from the shadows. However, some saw a different way forward.\n\n These pioneers would be the ones to try to negotiate with their new occupiers, who they found to be far more reasonable than most would believe. Rather than have their lives ruined by pursuing futile resistance, they instead chose to carve a place of their own within this new world.\n\n Thanks to their political maneuvering, the slave-trade would be allowed to continue within the lands that were once Old Appleloosa. In exchange, all they had to do was keep the peace and remain loyal to the Cloudsdale Enclave. It was a great deal, all things considered."

LIT_flavorevent.46.d:0 "Not much had changed on the rock farms. Gritstone still woke with the sun, said his prayers to The Great Rock, farmed throughout the day, and slept with the moon. Just as he had been doing for years. Really, if it weren't for the pegasi flying overhead, nothing would be different at all.\n\n Even the tributes he had to provide were largely the same. If anything, the ponies who collected were far more pleasant. They might not of been the friendliest of sort, but they simply came by, collected their share of his labor, and left. Compared to the raider gangs and government bureaucrats that preceeded them, they were downright pleasant.\n\n No matter what changed out in the Wasteland, Gritstone's farm would remain as steady as the rocks on it. It was a comforting fact."

LIT_flavorevent.47.d:0 "When [SHA.GetName] first fell, it was expected for there to be some resistance to occupation. What was not expected was for the entire land below to devolve into chaos.\n\n Raider gangs, thought long since erradicated, have made an astounding comeback all across the more rural regions. Fishermen and naval remnants alike have taken to the Azureway, turning to a life of piracy to sustain themselves as entropy consumed the mainland. To make matters even worse, remnants of the fearsome Gawdyna's Talons continue to fight on as if the war had never even ended.\n\n Even the capital of the former Republic has been taken over by remnants of the Republican army, who fought on with enough ferocity to make up for their defeat. With the safety of our soldiers but a distant hope, we can do little more than try to evade the hostile ponies below and continue on with our crusade."

LIT_flavorevent.48.d:0 "The lands surrounding the city of Leslie have a long and proud history, one dating back to their formation by escaped serfs. This history mixed in well with their practices of raiding, leading to a nation of barbarians driven by a noble cause. Now, that history has come to cause no end of troubles for us.\n\n So-called 'Freedom Fighters' and raiders alike now plague our new lands, resisting our ponies in every way they can. They continue to undermine our defences, sabotage our industry, and overall be an annoyance. So long as the ponies of Leslie continue to fight us, we shall be bogged down with trying to keep the region under control."

LIT_flavorevent.49.d:0 "Today, a dozen pegasi were sent into the jungle. Today, a dozen pegasi lost their lives. Most of them were fortunate enough to die in the initial ambush, but those unlucky enough to be captured were unlikely to have pleasant deaths.\n\n Such is our struggle throughout the lands of New Mango. The batponies, who some had foalishly considered to be our distant cousins, proved themselves to be just as barbaric and unforgiving as the rest of the Wasteland. Rather than embrace us as their better bretheren and work alongside us to achieve a better future, they have insted insisted on fighting us at every single turn. The deeper we go into the jungle, the fiercer they get, with many areas being considered 'no-go zones' by our soldiers.\n\n To further prove their degeneracy, many of the bats have also taken to drug smuggling across our borders, which has served to both increase crime and undermine local economies. If we are to truly secure New Mango, action will have to be taken to restore order throughout."

LIT_flavorevent.50.d:0 "Though we have successfully dealt with the majority of Talon remnants, one rather sizable band of them still remains: A force calling themselves Regina's Talons. Their leader, Regina Grimfeathers, is the daughter of the currently missing Gawdyna Grimfeathers. She has become a sort of icon for the resistance against us, following in her mothers footsteps in becoming a champion of republicanism.\n\nWe need to decide how to deal with her and we need to do so quickly. The longer she's allowed to run rampant, the more damage we have to deal with. Unfortunately, resources are scarce right now, and loyal ponies are even scarcer.\n\nThe idea has been proposed to use the promise of wealth to encourage ponies to hunt for her themselves, though we of course have no intention of ever actually paying out a single cap. Otherwise, we'll have to stretch our forces even thinner to look for her."

To name a few of the charges which she must face justice for:\n\nMurder, treason, kidnapping, blackmailing public officials, banditry, vandalism, arson, tresspassing, and serial jaywalking.\n\nShould you have any information regarding her whereabouts, please report it to your nearest officials immediately. Should you see her, do not approach. She is to be considered armed and dangerous.\n\nA bounty of no less than 10,000 bottlecaps will be paid out upon evidence of her death. Thank you, and remember: From vigilance comes victory."

LIT_flavorevent.52.d:0 "Today, the recently established Office of Endorsed Vigilantism received no less than 30 decapitated heads, as evidence of criminals killed. Unfortunately, these heads did not belong to any recognized criminals within our nation. Rather, they belonged to a number of commanding officers who had recently gone missing.\n\nAccompanying the gory display was a letter from Regina herself, demanding that we withdraw our bounty on her immediately. Refusal to do so would result in her coming after the heads of our government officials next.\n\nIn light of this incident, the Office of Endorsed Vigilantism has decided to withdraw the bounty on her head. Though many within our government and military decry giving in to such demands, the now former director of the OEV has cited a concern for their own safety as the primary reason for the decision."

LIT_flavorevent.53.d:0 "Our nation was rocked to it's very core today after a series of high-profile murders across the surface and sky alike. At the scene of each and every crime was a copy of the same letter, penned and copied by Regina Grimfeather's.\n\nThe letter is a mix of pro-republican propaganda, inspiring quotes, and a promise that she will someday return to liberate the ponies of the Azurian region. That last note was of particular importance, as she claims that she is setting off for unknown lands to gather support for her grand return.\n\nThough this is concerning for many reasons, it does mean that we are given a breather for the moment. Perhaps someday, we'll have to deal with whatever force she manages to gather under her banner. For now though, we can rest easy."

LIT_flavorevent.54.d:0 "In the chaos surrounding our invasion of the lands below, a number of warlords managed to seize power. The death of the surface economy and the increase of strife then led to the armies of these warlords growing drastically. They in turn then caused more chaos, creating a never ending loop of suffering that only benefits them.\n\nWhile we can appreciate them proving their worth, we can not tolerate a bunch of criminals ruling over our lands as if they were kings. Our top governmening and military officials are all in agreement that these troublemakers have to be dealt with. However, we have yet to decide how to handle them.\n\nOur first option, and the most straightforward, is to simply kill them. This would solve the issue quite nicely, but would also put the lives of our soldiers at risk.\n\nAlternatively, we can offer them amnesty in exchange for their loyalty. After all, we can appreciate their talents, and they would be useful assets."
