### FOCUS TREE ###
##################

### Remember: no "Stable".
### Remember: you are not forced to write giant texts for focuses. Mystery`s tree is more event-oriented. 
### Can`t say this for others, but for now we are not talking about them.
### TBH very few people read focus descriptions anyway. -Better than nothing, Agent 4

### Opening Focuses ###

MAS_Photo:0 "Stolen Photos"
MAS_Photo_desc:0 "A series of classified photographs taken by our recon teams have gone missing. Concerningly, these photos depict the Surface, which is far more habitable than our previous projections. If these were to fall into the wrong hooves, it could lead to widespread dissent and chaos across the entire Ministry!"

MAS_Chase:0 "A Suspicious Absence"
MAS_Chase_desc:0 "One of our scientists failed to report for work duty today, with no notice of absence provided. In light of recent events, this is considered highly suspicious. The Investigative Committee will be checking up on her."

MAS_Lockdown:0 "Lockdown Protocol"
MAS_Lockdown_desc:0 "We haven’t heard back from our agent for a while, and many of our personnel are getting uneasy. To help preserve the stability of our Ministry, we shall implement full lockdown protocols. A full curfew will be enforced and no one will be allowed to leave their room without a security escort."

### ACT 1 ###

MAS_P2S:0 "First Steps Towards Order"
MAS_P2S_desc:0 "Action must be taken, lest our entire Ministry be consumed by the flames of chaos! Minister Horny shall gather those loyal to him, and prepare to act."

MAS_P2F1:0 "Chaos Rises!"
MAS_P2F1_desc:0 "The situation is only growing more dire. In order to restore order, we shall bolster both our security forces and our Investigative Committee. Ponies will think twice before protesting against our leadership if they know that they’ll be beat down or dragged away in the night."

MAS_P2F2C1:0 "New Committee Offices"
MAS_P2F2C1_desc:0 "The Investigative Committee is being overwhelmed with the amount of work we’ve thrust upon them. To help them keep up with everything, we’ll reallocate resources towards providing them with more workspace and personnel."

MAS_P2F2C2:0 "New Manufactory"
MAS_P2F2C2_desc:0 "Our security forces require more armaments. We’ll reallocate our resources towards providing for them."

MAS_P2F3:0 "Volunteers"
MAS_P2F3_desc:0 "A number of volunteers that wouldn’t usually be deemed fit for our security forces are asking to join. While we could always use more hooves, there are concerns regarding lowering our standards."

MAS_P2F4C1:0 "A Committee Dinner"
MAS_P2F4C1_desc:0 "The Investigative Committee is hosting a dinner soon. It is being hosted at the same time as the Security Department’s own dinner. Which should our Minister attend?"

MAS_P2F4C2:0 "A Security Dinner"
MAS_P2F4C2_desc:0 "The Security Department is hosting a dinner soon. It is being hosted at the same time as the Investigative Committee’s own dinner. Which should our Minister attend? "

MAS_P2F5C1:0 "Unacceptable Behavior"
MAS_P2F5C1_desc:0 "A budget meeting between the heads of each department came to an abrupt end recently, after Commander Iron and Chief Detective Cursed Soul, who was sent in the Director’s stead, ended up in a hoof fight. Chief Detective Soul was injured during the affair, and the Investigative Committee is now demanding that Commander Iron be reprimanded and demoted. The Commander has countered this with a claim that the Chief Detective is at fault for this and is the one who should be demoted." 

MAS_P2F5C2:0 "Close Production"
MAS_P2F5C2_desc:0 "Director Night has raised concerns regarding our focus on armament production. She claims that focusing on civilian production would benefit us far more. This has of course led to a rise in tensions between the Investigative Committee and the Security Department."

MAS_P2F5C3:0 "Robot Question"
MAS_P2F5C3_desc:0 "Commander Iron has come to us with a plan to support the Security Department: He would like to repurpose our robots to support our security personnel. Director Night has spoken out against this, claiming that all of our robots are needed where they are right now."

MAS_P2F5C4:0 "The Servant System"
MAS_P2F5C4_desc:0 "Under the Servant System, as established in 1163, a large amount of our population  has been classified as servants. These servants are not afforded pony rights, and are considered little more than property to our Ministry."

MAS_P2F6C1:0 "Magic Competition"
MAS_P2F6C1_desc:0 "Director Night wishes to host a magical competition, in order to see who the strongest unicorns within our Ministry are. Should we send resources towards this project?"

MAS_P2F6C2:0 "War Games"
MAS_P2F6C2_desc:0 "Commander Iron wishes to host a series of war games between various departments, in order to help train our personnel to defend themselves. Should we send resources towards this project?"

MAS_P2F7C1:0 "Only the Best"
MAS_P2F7C1_desc:0 "The Investigative Committee has raised concerns regarding the quality of our security forces. They are calling for stricter standards to be enforced, requiring that all security personnel be required to meet higher magical standards."

MAS_P2F7C2:0 "Every Caster Counts"
MAS_P2F7C2_desc:0 "A spell is a spell, no matter whose horn it is from. In order to further bolster our security forces, Commander Iron is asking for approval to lower his departments standards."

MAS_P2F8:0 "Final Meeting"
MAS_P2F8_desc:0 "Minister Miracle has called all department heads to an emergency meeting. Let’s see what he wants."

MAS_P2F9:0 "The Ministry is Safe"
MAS_P2F9_desc:0 "Our Ministry has been stabilized, and Minister Miracle’s rule reaffirmed. The future is bright."


### Mystery Night ###
# From Mystery's person.

MAS_P3MS:0 "My Turn"
MAS_P3MS_desc:0 "I have done it. Minister Miracle has been displaced, and I am now the Sixth Minister."
MAS_P3M1C1:0 "A Miraculous Endorsement"
MAS_P3M1C1_desc:0 "Many within the Ministry still look up to and respect our former Minister. To help consolidate our rule, we shall have a small chat with him and set up a speech where he gives Minister Night his full and enthusiastic endorsement as his successor."
MAS_P3M1C2:0 "From Pens to Revolvers"
MAS_P3M1C2_desc:0 "We now have the entire Ministry at our command and no longer need to dedicate our precious ponies to simple administrative tasks. Our office personnel shall be sent to the field, where they shall better serve our interests."
MAS_P3M1C3:0 "Tying Up Loose Ends"
MAS_P3M1C3_desc:0 "Captain Tough Iron and his cronies are still an issue for us. In the interest of our Ministries stability, he must be dealt with. It’s a shame how he died in that freak training accident."
MAS_P3M2C1:0 "Protecting Knowledge"
MAS_P3M2C1_desc:0 "We are the last bastion of Equestria, the last bastion of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences, and the last bastion of ponykind itself. We can not risk our own safety, for by doing so we would be risking the safety of ponykind as a whole. "



### Mystery Night military tree ###

MAS_ArmyOfDetectives:0 "Army of Detectives"
MAS_ArmyOfDetectives_desc:0 "We can not trust the Security Department to protect our Ministry. So, we shall ensure that our own detectives are spread throughout their ranks, overseeing all they do. While we're at it, we shall keep an eye on every other department."

MAS_IncreaceMilBudget:0 "Increase Security Budget"
MAS_IncreaceMilBudget_desc:0 "Drastic times require drastic measures, and our budget is no exception to this. If we are to ensure that the Security Department is capable of protecting us all, we must allocate more resources towards them."

MAS_FortificationsForAnyCase:0 "Fortify the Stable"
MAS_FortificationsForAnyCase_desc:0 "Our reserve equipment, our scientists, our laboratories, and so much more - it's all inside of Stable 49. If it falls, the Ministry falls. And even though our soldiers have the best equipment and training in the world, we should further fortify our entrance. Y'know, just in case."

MAS_ExpandTheStable:0 "Expand the Stable"
MAS_ExpandTheStable_desc:0 "We are limited largely by space. Expanding onto the Surface is out of the question, so we must instead begin expanding our facilities underground."

MAS_NewMachineries:0 "New Machinery"
MAS_NewMachineries_desc:0 "Our industrial machinery is outdated, most of it being as old as our stable itself. In the interest of improving both our civilian and security manufacturing, we should improve upon and upgrade our machinery."

MAS_ExpandTheArmyOfMages:0 "More Mages in Security"
MAS_ExpandTheArmyOfMages_desc:0 "The protection of Ministry assets should be our first and foremost concern. We shall transfer some of our more skilled mages from other departments over to security. Not only shall this ensure the height of magical talent within our security forces, but it will also further shake the grip that the late Tough Iron’s supporters have over the department."

MAS_MoreCarefulLook:0 "Conscripting Talented Servants"
MAS_MoreCarefulLook_desc:0 "Not all of our servants are useless when it comes to magic. A number of them can even pass our Security Departments standards. Though this speaks poorly of said standards, it does mean we could offer these servants a position within their department."

MAS_FillOurStockpiles:0 "A Successful Recall"
MAS_FillOurStockpiles_desc:0 "Our R&D Department has recently been working on creating a teleportation-based recall spell, allowing us to essentially summon any ponies or objects from one location to our own. Though most of their experiments have ended in failure, the latest one has been a massive success. An attempt to "recall" items from an old military facility listed in our records has resulted in quite a large stash of wartime weaponry. Unfortunately, we doubt they could repeat this success."

MAS_BuildAASystem:0 "Build An Anti-Air System"
MAS_BuildAASystem_desc:0 "We’re not sure when, or how, but the Director of Manufacturing and the Director of Logistics apparently worked together for once and created a fully functional anti-air flak cannon, that can be raised to the Surface through a silo door. While this is an impressive feat of engineering, we can’t help but ask...why?"

MAS_BetterTacticsBetterSolutions:0 "Better Tactics, Better Solutions"
MAS_BetterTacticsBetterSolutions_desc:0 "We need two things: good officers and a good strategy. And while our security officers are the best we know of, our strategy leaves a lot to be desired. If we just get encircled by barbaric tribals and destroyed at first contact, we are just wasting lives. But if we improve our tactics, we can be the ones to encircle."

MAS_PreventForeignResearch:0 "Protecting Our Communications"
MAS_PreventForeignResearch_desc:0 "Having a good idea is all well and good, but if someone steals it, it's not only useless, but it can also be turned against us. And with all those robots out there, it wouldn't be the first time an inventor gets killed by his own invention."

MAS_IndustryIsNessesary:0 "Industry is Necessary"
MAS_IndustryIsNessesary_desc:0 "We need even more industry if we are to fully and properly supply our security officers. More resources shall be allocated towards expanding our production capabilities, so as to ensure that every officer gets a rifle."

MAS_ImproveOurSkills:0 "Improve Our Skills"
MAS_ImproveOurSkills_desc:0 "Our officers are undoubtedly the best of the best - however, our strategy still isn't. Putting a battalion of the best officers in the world under the command of a group of discordant supervisors is like giving a sharpshooter with Parkinson's a laser rifle with night vision and- you get the point, we should fix this."

MAS_AgentsAreWatching:0 "We Are Watching"
MAS_AgentsAreWatching_desc:0 "We see all, hear all, and know all. Nobody can hide from the eyes of the Ministry."

MAS_ContinueOurTrainings:0 "Continue Our Training"
MAS_ContinueOurTrainings_desc:0 "Guns are all well and good to have, but if you don't know how to use them, you can charge at your enemy with sticks and stones too. And as sad as this fact may be, too many of our officers are facing it. This can not be."

MAS_PreparedAndReady:0 "Prepared and Ready"
MAS_PreparedAndReady_desc:0 "We have invested a lot of time and resources, but now it finally pays off. Our Security Department is now larger, stronger, and more modern than ever before, and we are now prepared for any threat the Surface may throw at us."

#### Tough ####

MAS_P3TS:0 "Why we still here?"
shareMAS_P3T1:0 "Just to suffer?"
MAS_P3T2C1:0 "Every night, I can feel my leg..."
MAS_P3T2C2:0 "and my arm..."
MAS_P3T2C3:0 "even my fingers."
MAS_P3T3C1:0 "The body I’ve lost..."
MAS_P3T3C2:0 "the comrades I’ve lost..."
MAS_P3T3C3:0 "won’t stop hurting..." 
MAS_P3T4:0 "It’s like they’re all still there."
MAS_P3T5:0 "You feel it too, don’t you?"

#### HORNY ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ####

MAS_P3HS:0 "Back to Work"
MAS_P3HS_desc:0 "Now that our Ministry has been reunified, we can turn our attention to dealing with the problems outside of our walls. The Surface awaits."

MAS_P3H1:0 "The Legitimate Successors"
MAS_P3H1_desc:0 "Equestria did not die with the world. It lived on, in the form of its most talented and faithful Ministry. It is our duty as the last remnant of the Equestrian government to rebuild the world in our image."

MAS_P3H2:0 "To Reclaim the World"
MAS_P3H2_desc:0 "We have found about what we expected out here. Primitive tribes, simpleminded raiders, and nonpony creatures infest these once prosperous lands. We will see to it that they are all dealt with."

MAS_P3H3:0 "The Lightning Ultimatum"
MAS_P3H3_desc:0 "Our scouts have returned from the east. They speak of a bunch of primitives calling themselves 'The Lightning Scavengers'. Though they might be a simpler people, they may still be civilized enough to recognize their saviors. We shall give them a chance to peacefully submit to our rule, for their own good."

MAS_P3H4C1:0 "Enough Raiders!"
MAS_P3H4C1_desc:0 "Raiders are the worst scum of post-war Equestria. Wiping them out is critical to ensure the stability and security of this region, beginning with the filth occupying the plains to the east."

MAS_P3H4C2:0 "Rallying Support"
MAS_P3H4C2_desc:0 "Despite the fears of some of our personnel, we haven't been immediately devoured by the terrors of the Surface. Indeed, we are actually doing quite well for ourselves. Using this fact, Minister Miracle shall rally more support for his expansionist efforts."

MAS_P3H4C3:0 "Deal With Featherbrush"
MAS_P3H4C3_desc:0 "To the north, a bunch of rightful Equestrian land is occupied by disgusting barbaric rude-mannered birds. They dare claim the land to be their own. Haven't they gotten the memo? Creatures don't get to own property."

MAS_P3H5:0 "The Appleloosan Deal"
MAS_P3H5_desc:0 "The wise ponies of Old Appleloosa seem to be lacking in technological edge, but what they do have is a lot of "servants". It seems they utilize a system similar to our own. Perhaps we could work out a mutually beneficial agreement?"

MAS_P3H6C1:0 "Resettlement Initiative"
MAS_P3H6C1_desc:0 "Now that our most immediate threats have been dealt with, we are now free to begin the process of sending our superior Ministry ponies to properly rule over and develop our new land. While out there, they may also see to managing the inferior Wastelanders that we have saved."

MAS_P3H6C2:0 "Restore Order"
MAS_P3H6C2_desc:0 "The situation is growing worse every day. Servants escaping, overseers being bribed, and our transports being sabotaged are merely the beginning. Luckily, our great Minister is already taking the necessary steps to ensure the stability of our ever growing Ministry."

MAS_P3H6C3:0 "Reassign Personnel"
MAS_P3H6C3_desc:0 "More land means more forces needed for its security. Our recruitment efforts need to be increased if we are to keep a strong grip on the newly acquired regions. After all, what use is the Office of Archives if our Ministry falls to barbarians?"

MAS_P3H7:0 "Dealing With Dissent"
MAS_P3H7_desc:0 "Those overgrown chickens are at it again! Taking advantage of our current crisis, a gang of griffons has started a revolt in what used to be their stronghold. We must send our forces in there to keep the peace and make sure that this attempted revolution does not spread!"

MAS_P3H8:0 "The Department of Slave Affairs"
MAS_P3H8_desc:0 "With the troubles on our homefront over, we may now turn our attention to the large slave population we now seem to have. In order to better organize and manage them, we shall create a proper department within our Ministry who is entirely dedicated to just that purpose."

MAS_P3H9C1:0 "A Question of Standards"
MAS_P3H9C1_desc:0 "Thanks to the recent developments, it might be wise to think how we should proceed with our army. Our great Minister Horny has full control of the composition of our troops, leaving the answer up to him: Shall our troops consist of only the best magicians, or shall we sacrifice their prowess in favour of more diversified and flexible forces?"

MAS_P3H9C2:0 "Free the Superior"
MAS_P3H9C2_desc:0 "Our nation has grown considerably. So much, in fact, that we no longer need to rely on our servants for menial tasks. It is time that we declare our unicorn bretheren to be redeemed of the crimes of their forefahters. From this day onward, all unicorns within our great Ministry shall be considered free ponies, as such is their right by birth."

MAS_P3H9C3:0 "Industrial Expansion"
MAS_P3H9C3_desc:0 "As the Ministries territory grows, so too do the needs of its citizens. If we are to keep the unicorns of our nation happy and our forces ready, we need to substantially expand our industrial capacities."

MAS_P3HF:0 "Form A Proper Government"
MAS_P3HF_desc:0 "Most ponies of our glorious Ministry would be pretty happy with what we have achieved so far. The tribes we have taken under our flag and the raiders we have pacified are already great monuments to the superiority of our civilization. However, one pony does not wish to rest here; one pony has a dream to create an even grander society..."

It was considered both a punishment and a form of redemption for those involved in the General Strike of 1162.

MAS_magic_army_MagicalSupremacy_idea_desc:0 "Our security personnel are all expected to be able to meet very strict standards when it comes to their mastery of the arcane.

MAS_MagicBlossom_adv_desc:0 "If one were to ask for information on Magic Blossom, answers would vary wildly. His name doesn't appear in the Office of Archive's records, and very few could claim to have known him growing up. Some theorize that he was made in a lab, while others propose him to be the lost third son of Minister Spark. Whatever the case may be, his devotion to Minister Miracle is well known and feared."

masevent.100.t:0 "Stolen Photo"
masevent.100.d:0 "For the past 200 years, the Ministry has been operating under the assumption that little was left of the Surface, save for radioactive ruins and mutated monstrosities from beyond pony imagination. This has heavily influenced the perception of those within our ranks, and has gone a long way towards maintaining stability. However, a recent recon mission to the Surface discovered that our projections were entirely off. Not only were radiation suits unnecessary for their mission, but they actually found relatively unmutated plant-life, and signs of animal life. This has the potential to shake our Ministry to it’s very core if it were to get out. As a result, the entire recon team has been sworn to secrecy and placed under constant surveillance, and the photographs taken have been locked into the Minister’s safe. \n \n Late last night, the Minister’s office was broken into. His safe was broken into, with the only thing taken being the photos depicting the Surface. We could quickly have a crisis on our hooves if they got out to the public! "
masevent.100.a:0 "We must find it."

masevent.101.t:0 "The Chase Begins"
masevent.101.d:0 "Within the Ministry, every pony is expected to do their part. Failing to report for work duty is a serious offence, one that can carry a hefty punishment if no valid reason can be provided for the absence. So when one of our scientists, Dr. Marigold Miracle, failed to report for her shift, we were quick to send an Investigative Committee detective to her residence. However, upon arriving, he found Dr. Miracle hastily packing her saddlebags. Before he could confront her, she grabbed her bags and teleported away."
masevent.101.a:0 "Search the room!"

masevent.1011.t:0 "Searching For Evidence"
masevent.1011.d:0 "Our top detective, Magic Blossom, has been put on this case. Arriving at the scene, he immediately went to work searching the entire dwelling. From the wardrobe to the bathroom cabinet, no stone was left unturned. The onlooking security personnel were impressed by the speed at which he went through the entire residence, searching the entire place top to bottom within a mere 10 minutes. At the end of it, he emerged with a single piece of evidence: one of the stolen Surface photos, presumably left behind due to Dr. Miracle’s haste. With this, we have a culprit for the crime, and a possible idea of where she went."
masevent.1011.a:0 "Magic Blossom did his job well."

masevent.1012.t:0 "Blossom’s Bizarre Adventure"
masevent.1012.d:0 "Blossom’s first few steps out into the Surface were met with a tremble in the ground, as a giant mutated scorpion came charging out from behind a rock at him. The abomination before him was no match for his might though, and he quickly dispatched it. Following this bit of excitement, he immediately set out into the Wastes. \n \n It would be over two months before he finally came across a settlement with a solid lead. In the time before finding it, he had joined a local Chapter of the Steel Rangers, explored the city of the dead, killed a gang leader, and blown up a military base home to an army of mutants that sought to march upon the entire Wasteland. \n \n Walking among the town, he couldn’t help but think about how it was the most disgusting thing he had ever seen. Scrap shacks, occupied by pathetic filth-coated creatures in the shell of ponies. Coming across what appeared to be an establishment of intoxication, he spoke to the authoritative stallion standing behind the bar. He couldn’t tell if the stallion’s natural fur color was a dark brown, or if he was just that filthy. Managing to suppress a sneer was perhaps the hardest thing he had ever done, as he showed the dirty rag before him a picture of Dr. Miracle. \n \n Surprisingly, the walking bag of dirt actually proved himself useful. He identified her as ‘Señorita Marigold’, a stranger that had come into the town recently. Finally, after his long journey, he had found his target. \n \n Entering a small shack that he was told she resided in, Blossom prepared to put an end to this..."
masevent.1012.a:0 "She gets the drop on him."
masevent.1012.b:0 "She’s completely unprepared."

masevent.102.t:0 "Interdepartmental Tensions"
masevent.102.d:0 "Our Ministry is entering the worst crisis it has faced under Minister Miracle's rule. Instability is growing rapidly, as many discontent personnel and servants begin to mumble their dissent. In order to prevent this from escalating into a widespread protest against his rule, the Minister has begun to take extensive measures. The Investigative Committee has taken to keeping a very close eye on everypony, with them constantly dragging ponies away in the night. Meanwhile, the Security Department has more than tripled its patrols, helping disuade any potential troublemakers.\n\n Unfortunately, this has led to another issue. Our Investigative Committee and Security Department personnel are being put under quite a lot of stress right now, which has led to them taking it out on eachother. Fights are breaking out between their personnel rather commonly now, with this rivalry even being present among the highest ranks of each department.\n\n To make matters even worse, Commander Tough Iron and Director Mystery Night have begun to clash on a variety of political issues. While the good Commander believes we should emerge to the Surface and begin to claim our rightful place in the world, Director Night instead calls for us to further isolate ourselves from the outside world.\n\n  We'll have to be careful in how we deal with them, lest we tear our Ministry apart."
masevent.102.a:0 "I'm surrounded by idiots."

masevent.1021.t:0 "The Issue of Blessed Touch"
masevent.1021.d:0 "Minister Miracle's brother, Blessed Touch, has always been a figure of some concern. Being the Director of Interdepartmental Affairs has allowed him to cement himself has a popular figure among many of our higher ups, making him practically untouchable. Before this crisis, Detective Magic Blossom was trusted with keeping a close eye on him. Unfortunately, Detective Blossom is now gone, and all Investigative Committee detectives are already being overworked trying to keep order within the Ministry as a whole. This has allowed Blessed Touch to go for long periods of time without any sort of supervision, which could give him time to plan and plot against our Minister."
masevent.1021.a:0 "Concerning."

masevent.110.t:0 "The Lockdown"
masevent.110.d:0 "The situation has steadily grown worse within our Ministry. As more ponies begin to doubt Minister Miracle, he has begun to escalate the measures being taken to maintain order. Everyone is now under constant watch, and not one pony is to step a single hoof outside of their quarters without an escort. These increasingly invasive measures have resulted in even more fear and doubt among our personnel, making this perhaps counterproductive. However, as this is all going on, another issue still persists: Detective Blossom still hasn't returned from his mission. This has left Minister Miracle very concerned, and he has begun to consider sending another detective out into the Wasteland to check up on him. Director Night has argued against this however, calling it a waste of an detective and reassuring the Minister that Detective Blossom is perfectly capable of taking care of himself."
masevent.110.a:0 "Send a detective out to him!"
masevent.110.b:0 "No, he will be just fine."

masevent.1101.t:0 "Blossom's Unceremonial Return"

masevent.1101.d0:0 "Magic Blossom was resting in an old abandoned shack when Detective Shine came across him. Surprised to see another Investigative Committee member out here, he was quick to begin asking about what had happened back home. He was quickly filled in, being informed about the crisis back in the Ministry and the instability it is currently facing. In light of this, Blossom was very quick to take off back towards his home, constantly teleporting to speed up his journey. \n\n Upon his arrival back at the Stable, he was faced with a locked door. The door control didn't respond to the passcode, and his attempts to communicate over the intercom were met with silence. Though he was exhausted, he didn't let this stop him and proceeded to teleport into the Stable, where he was faced with..."
masevent.1101.d1:0 "Magic Blossom has finally returned home from his mission. However, rather than being met with a welcoming committee, he was instead met with a locked stable door. His passcode wasn't working and his attempts to communicate over the intercom were met with silence. Fearing the worst, he proceeded to bypass the Stable door entirely through teleportation, and was immediately met with..."
masevent.1101.a:0 "...an Investigative Committee detective."
masevent.1101.b:0 "...an empty entry hall."
masevent.1101.c:0 "...an activated security turret."

masevent.11011.t:0 "Accident"
masevent.11011.d1:0 "Upon entering the Stable, Blossom was immediately met by a hailstorm of bullets from a security turret. Being unprepared, he quickly went down. His body would be found a hour later, with the cause of death being chalked up to a turret malfunction. Minister Horny was of course devastated, and he has called for a full investigation into this occurence. Director Night has promised that no resource will be spared finding the one responsible and bringing them to justice. Commander Iron, on the other hoof, has stated that this was a simple accident and that no one is responsible. He has strongly advised against wasting any resources on an investigation, but has promised his support should one occur."
masevent.11011.d2:0 "Upon entering the Stable, Blossom was immediately met by an empty hallway. However, as he proceeded towards the Stable attrium, an automated turret began to open fire upon him. He was quick to throw up a magic shield, saving his life. Following this occurence, he was quick to make his way to Minister Miracle's office, while remaining cautious of any more attempts on his life. Rushing past the Minister's guards, despite their protests, he burst into Horny's office and was met with the stallion himself.\n\n He was quick to give his report, informing the Minister of his success. However, the apparent attempt on his life was also noted, and a Horny was left furious that such a thing could happen under his nose. He granted Detective Blossom some time to rest, and called an emergency meeting to discuss an investigation into this occurence."
masevent.11011.a:0 "An investigation is unnecessary."
masevent.11011.b:0 "An investigation will be conducted at once!"
