### FOCUS TREE ###
##################

### Remember: no "Stable".
### Remember: you are not forced to write giant texts for focuses. Mystery`s tree is more event-oriented. 
### Can`t say this for others, but for now we are not talking about them.
### TBH very few people read focus descriptions anyway. -Better than nothing, Agent 4

### Opening Focuses ###

MAS_Photo:0 "Stolen Photos"
MAS_Photo_desc:0 "A series of classified photographs taken by our recon teams have gone missing. Concerningly, these photos depict the Surface, which is far more habitable than our previous projections. If these were to fall into the wrong hooves, it could lead to widespread dissent and chaos across the entire Ministry!"

MAS_Chase:0 "A Suspicious Absence"
MAS_Chase_desc:0 "One of our scientists failed to report for work duty today, with no notice of absence provided. A security officer will be sent to check up on her."

MAS_Lockdown:0 "Lockdown Protocol"
MAS_Lockdown_desc:0 "We haven’t heard back from our agent for a while, and many of our personnel are getting uneasy. To help preserve the stability of our Ministry, we shall implement full lockdown protocols."

### ACT 1 ###

MAS_P2S:0 “First Steps Towards Order”
MAS_P2S_desc:0 “Action must be taken, lest our entire Ministry be consumed by the flames of chaos! Minister Horny shall gather those loyal to him, and prepare to act.”
MAS_P2F1:0 “Chaos Rises!”
MAS_P2F1_desc:0 “The situation is only growing more dire. In order to restore order, we shall bolster both our security forces and our Investigative Committee. Ponies will think twice before protesting against our leadership if they know that they’ll be beat down or dragged away in the night.”
MAS_P2F2C1:0 “New Committee Offices”
MAS_P2F2C1_desc:0 “The Investigative Committee is being overwhelmed with the amount of work we’ve thrust upon them. To help them keep up with everything, we’ll reallocate resources towards providing them with more workspace and personnel.”
MAS_P2F2C2:0 “New Manufactory”
MAS_P2F2C2_desc:0 “Our security forces require more armaments. We’ll reallocate our resources towards providing for them.”
MAS_P2F3:0 “Volunteers”
MAS_P2F3_desc:0 “A number of volunteers that wouldn’t usually be deemed fit for our security forces are asking to join. While we could always use more hooves, there are concerns regarding lowering our standards.”
MAS_P2F4C1:0 “A Committee Dinner”
MAS_P2F4C1_desc:0 “The Investigative Committee is hosting a dinner soon. It is being hosted at the same time as the Security Department’s own dinner. Which should our Minister attend?”
MAS_P2F4C2:0 “A Security Dinner”
MAS_P2F4C2_desc:0 “The Security Department is hosting a dinner soon. It is being hosted at the same time as the Investigative Committee’s own dinner. Which should our Minister attend? ”
MAS_P2F5C1:0 “Unacceptable Behavior”
MAS_P2F5C1_desc:0 “A budget meeting between the heads of each department came to an abrupt end recently, after Commander Iron and High Operative Soul, who was sent in the Director’s stead, ended up in a hoof fight. High Operative Soul was injured during the affair, and the Investigative Committee is now demanding that Commander Iron be reprimanded and demoted. The Commander has countered this with a claim that High Operative Soul is at fault for this and is the one who should be demoted.” 
### -This will be shortened, after I write the event, (Illiterate Scribe)
MAS_P2F5C2:0 “Close Production”
MAS_P2F5C2_desc:0 “Director Night has raised concerns regarding our focus on armament production. She claims that focusing on civilian production would benefit us far more. This has of course led to a rise in tensions between the Investigative Committee and the Security Department.”
MAS_P2F5C3:0 “Robot Question”
MAS_P2F5C3_desc:0 “Commander Iron has come to us with a plan to support the Security Department: He would like to repurpose our robots to support our security personnel. Director Night has spoken out against this, claiming that all of our robots are needed where they are right now.”
MAS_P2F5C4:0 “The Servant System”
MAS_P2F5C4_desc:0 “Under the Servant System, as established in 1163, a large amount of our population  has been classified as servants. These servants are not afforded pony rights, and are considered little more than property to our Ministry.”
MAS_P2F6C1:0 “Magic Competition”
MAS_P2F6C1_desc:0 “Director Night wishes to host a magical competition, in order to see who the strongest unicorns within our Ministry are. Should we send resources towards this project?”
MAS_P2F6C2:0 “War Games”
MAS_P2F6C2_desc:0 “Commander Iron wishes to host a series of war games between various departments, in order to help train our personnel to defend themselves. Should we send resources towards this project?”
MAS_P2F7C1:0 “Only the Best”
MAS_P2F7C1_desc:0 “The Investigative Committee has raised concerns regarding the quality of our security forces. They are calling for stricter standards to be enforced, requiring that all security personnel be required to meet higher magical standards.”
MAS_P2F7C2:0 “Every Caster Counts”
MAS_P2F7C2_desc:0 “A spell is a spell, no matter whose horn it is from. In order to further bolster our security forces, Commander Iron is asking for approval to lower his departments standards.”
MAS_P2F8:0 “Final Meeting”
MAS_P2F8_desc:0 “Minister Miracle has called all department heads to an emergency meeting. Let’s see what he wants.”
MAS_P2F9:0 “The Ministry is Safe”
MAS_P2F9_desc:0 “Our Ministry has been stabilized, and Minister Miracle’s rule reaffirmed. The future is bright.”


### Mystery Night ###
# From Mystery's person.

MAS_P3MS:0 “My Turn”
MAS_P3MS_desc:0 “I have done it. Minister Miracle has been displaced, and I am now the Sixth Minister.”
MAS_P3M1C1:0 “A Miraculous Endorsement”
MAS_P3M1C1_desc:0 “Many within the Ministry still look up to and respect our former Minister. To help consolidate our rule, we shall have a small chat with him and set up a speech where he gives Minister Night his full and enthusiastic endorsement as his successor.”
MAS_P3M1C2:0 “From Pens to Revolvers”
MAS_P3M1C2_desc:0 “We now have the entire Ministry at our command and no longer need to dedicate our precious ponies to simple administrative tasks. Our office personnel shall be sent to the field, where they shall better serve our interests.”
MAS_P3M1C3:0 “Tying Up Loose Ends”
MAS_P3M1C3_desc:0 “Captain Tough Iron and his cronies are still an issue for us. In the interest of our Ministries stability, he must be dealt with. It’s a shame how he died in that freak training accident.”
MAS_P3M2C1:0 “Protecting Knowledge”
MAS_P3M2C1_desc:0 “We are the last bastion of Equestria, the last bastion of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences, and the last bastion of ponykind itself. We can not risk our own safety, for by doing so we would be risking the safety of ponykind as a whole. ”



### Mystery Night military tree ###

MAS_ArmyOfDetectives:0 "Army of Detectives"
MAS_ArmyOfDetectives_desc:0 “We can not trust the Security Department to protect our Ministry. So, we shall ensure that our own operatives are spread throughout their ranks, overseeing all they do."




MAS_IncreaceMilBudget:0 "Increase Security Budget"
MAS_IncreaceMilBudget_desc:0 "Drastic times require drastic measures, and our budget is no exception to this. If we are to ensure that the Security Department is capable of protecting us all, we must allocate more resources towards them.”

MAS_FortificationsForAnyCase:0 "Fortify the Stable"
MAS_FortificationsForAnyCase_desc:0 "Our reserve equipment, our scientists, our laboratories, and so much more - it's all inside of Stable 49. If it falls, the Ministry falls. And even though our soldiers have the best equipment and training in the world, we should further fortify our entrance. Y'know, just in case."

MAS_ExpandTheStable:0 "Expand the Stable"
MAS_ExpandTheStable_desc:0 "We are limited largely by space. Expanding onto the Surface is out of the question, so we must instead begin expanding our facilities underground."

MAS_NewMachineries:0 "New Machinery"
MAS_NewMachineries_desc:0 "Our industrial machinery is outdated, most of it being as old as our stable itself. In the interest of improving both our civilian and security manufacturing, we should improve upon and upgrade our machinery."

MAS_ExpandTheArmyOfMages:0 "More Mages in Security"
MAS_ExpandTheArmyOfMages_desc:0 "The protection of Ministry assets should be our first and foremost concern. We shall transfer some of our more skilled mages from other departments over to security. Not only shall this ensure the height of magical talent within our security forces, but it will also further shake the grip that the late Tough Iron’s supporters have over the department."

MAS_MoreCarefulLook:0 "Conscripting Talented Servants"
MAS_MoreCarefulLook_desc:0 "Not all of our servants are useless when it comes to magic. A number of them can even pass our Security Departments standards. Though this speaks poorly of said standards, it does mean we could offer these servants a position within their department."

MAS_FillOurStockpiles:0 "A Successful Recall"
MAS_FillOurStockpiles_desc:0 "Our R&D Department has recently been working on creating a teleportation-based recall spell, allowing us to essentially summon any ponies or objects from one location to our own. Though most of their experiments have ended in failure, the latest one has been a massive success. An attempt to “recall” items from an old military facility listed in our records has resulted in quite a large stash of wartime weaponry. Unfortunately, we doubt they could repeat this success."

MAS_BuildAASystem:0 "Build An Anti-Air System"
MAS_BuildAASystem_desc:0 “We’re not sure when, or how, but the Director of Manufacturing and the Director of Logistics apparently worked together for once and created a fully functional anti-air flak cannon, that can be raised to the Surface through a silo door. While this is an impressive feat of engineering, we can’t help but ask...why?"

MAS_BetterTacticsBetterSolutions:0 "Better Tactics, Better Solutions"
MAS_BetterTacticsBetterSolutions_desc:0 "We need two things: good officers and a good strategy. And while our security officers are the best we know of, our strategy leaves a lot to be desired. If we just get encircled by barbaric tribals and destroyed at first contact, we are just wasting lives. But if we improve our tactics, we can be the ones to encircle."

MAS_PreventForeignResearch:0 "Protecting Our Communications"
MAS_PreventForeignResearch_desc:0 "Having a good idea is all well and good, but if someone steals it, it's not only useless, but it can also be turned against us. And with all those robots out there, it wouldn't be the first time an inventor gets killed by his own invention."

MAS_IndustryIsNessesary:0 "Industry is Necessary"
MAS_IndustryIsNessesary_desc:0 "We need even more industry if we are to fully and properly supply our security officers. More resources shall be allocated towards expanding our production capabilities, so as to ensure that every officer gets a rifle."

MAS_ImproveOurSkills:0 "Improve Our Skills"
MAS_ImproveOurSkills_desc:0 "Our officers are undoubtedly the best of the best - however, our strategy still isn't. Putting a battalion of the best officers in the world under the command of a group of discordant supervisors is like giving a sharpshooter with Parkinson's a laser rifle with night vision and- you get the point, we should fix this."

MAS_AgentsAreWatching:0 "We Are Watching"
MAS_ArmyOfDetectives_desc:0 "Nobody can hide from the eyes of the Ministry."

MAS_ContinueOurTrainings:0 "Continue Our Training"
MAS_ContinueOurTrainings_desc:0 "Guns are all well and good to have, but if you don't know how to use them, you can charge at your enemy with sticks and stones too. And as sad as this fact may be, too many of our officers are facing it. This can not be."

MAS_PreparedAndReady:0 "Prepared and Ready"
MAS_PreparedAndReady_desc:0 "We have invested a lot of time and resources, but now it finally pays off. Our Security Department is now larger, stronger, and more modern than ever before, and we are now prepared for any threat the Surface may throw at us."

#### Tough ####

MAS_P3TS:0 “Why we still here?”
shareMAS_P3T1:0 “Just to suffer?”
MAS_P3T2C1:0 “Every night, I can feel my leg...”
MAS_P3T2C2:0 “and my arm...”MAS_P3T2C3:0 “even my fingers.”
MAS_P3T3C1:0 “The body I’ve lost...”
MAS_P3T3C2:0 “the comrades I’ve lost...”
MAS_P3T3C3:0 “won’t stop hurting...” 
MAS_P3T4:0 “It’s like they’re all still there.”
MAS_P3T5:0 “You feel it too, don’t you?”

#### HORNY ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ####

MAS_P3HS:0 “Back to work”
MAS_P3HS_desc:0 “Our internal strife may be over, but our work is far from done. Using our allies in the government we shall establish our rule and bring the Ministry further than any of our ancestors ever could!”

MAS_P3H1:0 “We are the legitimate government”
MAS_P3H1_desc:0 “The time of unrest and uncertainty is over. Now, we shall rule wisely, and with a firm hoof and horn we shall ensure that our Ministry is as stable and prosperous as possible.”

MAS_P3H2:0 “We will take Equestria back”
MAS_P3H2_desc:0 “The Old World, which we were hiding from for so long, is filled with simpleminded brutes, savage raiders and poor imitations of functioning communities. We shall show them what it means to be a part of a strong and civilised society.”

MAS_P3H3:0 “Ultimatum”
MAS_P3H3_desc:0 “The scouts reported that a group calling themselves the “Lightning Scavengers” are currently operating south of our Ministry borders. If we are to reclaim Equestria, their factories and land will prove to be vital to our efforts. We shall give them an ultimatum: either they willingly give up… or they will be forced to give up.”

MAS_P3H4C1:0 “No more Raiders!”
MAS_P3H4C1_desc:0 “Raiders are the worst scum of post-war Equestria. Wiping them out is critical to ensure the stability and security of this region.”

MAS_P3H4C2:0 “Secure the River, get more land”
MAS_P3H4C2_desc:0 “Our ministry needs to grow, and for that, we need space. The river and the plains surrounding it will serve as a great point of expansion - all we need to do is get rid of its current occupiers.”

MAS_P3H4C3:0 “Show those BIRDS what magic means!”
MAS_P3H4C3_desc:0 “One of the Old World’s key provinces has been claimed by some pesky gryphons. We shall reclaim it using our superior magic and technology. To victory!”

MAS_P3H5:0 “Offer to OAP”
MAS_P3H5_desc:0 “The wise settlers of Old Appleooza seem to be lacking in technological edge, but what they do have is lots of “servants” by utilising a system similar to ours. Perhaps we could work out a mutually beneficial agreement?”

MAS_P3H6C1:0 “Resettle the unicorns”
MAS_P3H6C1_desc:0 “Now that we don’t have to worry about the threats from the south, we can focus on improving and properly claiming our newly gained lands. We shall start by letting some citizens of our Stable to move out to the plains and settle there. Proper preparations need to be made to ensure good communications between the stable and the outposts.”

MAS_P3H6C2:0 “Eradicate chaos”
MAS_P3H6C2_desc:0 “The situation is growing worse every day. Servants escaping, overseers being bribed and the sabotages of our transports are merely the beginning. Luckily, our great Minister is already taking the necessary steps to ensure the stability of our ever growing Ministry.”

MAS_P3H6C3:0 “Wave of conscription”
MAS_P3H6C3_desc:0 “More land means more forces needed for its security. Our recruitment efforts need to be increased if we are to keep a strong grip on the newly acquired regions.”

MAS_P3H7:0 “Fight the resistance”
MAS_P3H7_desc:0 “Those overgrown chickens are at it again! Using the moment of our weakness, the Featherbrush gryphons have started small revolts in what used to be their strongholds. We must send our forces in there to keep the peace and make sure that the revolution does not spread!”

MAS_P3H8:0 “Ministerial slavery program”
MAS_P3H8_desc:0 “With the troubles on our homefront over, we are now able to properly organise and secure the slave trade we get from Old Appleooza. ”

MAS_P3H9C1:0 “Question about our magic”
MAS_P3H9C1_desc:0 “Thanks to the recent developments, it might be wise to think how we should proceed with our army. Our great Minister Horny should have full control of the composition of our troops: Shall our troops consist of only the best magicians, or shall we sacrifice their prowess in favour of more diversified and flexible forces?”

MAS_P3H9C2:0 “No unicorn deserves to be a servant”
MAS_P3H9C2_desc:0 “Our nation has grown considerably. So much, in fact, that the magic-less creatures under our control can easily do all the tedious tasks we previously used less fortunate unicorns for. This shall end from now on.”

MAS_P3H9C3:0 “Industrial re-planning”
MAS_P3H9C3_desc:0 “As the Ministry’s influence zone grows, so do the needs of its citizens. If we are to keep the unicorns of our nation happy and our forces ready, we need to apply some industrial reforms and expand our horizons.”

MAS_P3HF:0 “Form a government?”
MAS_P3HF_desc:0 “Most ponies of our glorious Ministry would be pretty happy with what we have achieved so far. The tribes we have taken under our flag and the raiders we have pacified are already great monuments to the superiority of our civilisation. However, one pony does not wish to rest here; one pony has a dream that exceeds even the most ambitious plans of our society...”

#Feel free to add any event if after consulting about it with Genri(Minister).

masevent.100.t:0 "Stolen Photo"
masevent.100.d:0 "For the past 200 years, the Ministry has been operating under the assumption that little was left of the Surface, save for radioactive ruins and mutated monstrosities from beyond pony imagination. This has heavily influenced the perception of those within our ranks, and has gone a long way towards maintaining stability. However, a recent recon mission to the Surface discovered that our projections were entirely off. Not only were radiation suits unnecessary for their mission, but they actually found relatively unmutated plant-life, and signs of animal life. This has the potential to shake our Ministry to it’s very core if it were to get out. As a result, the entire recon team has been sworn to secrecy and placed under constant surveillance, and the photographs taken have been locked into the Minister’s safe. \n \n Late last night, the Minister’s office was broken into. His safe was broken into, with the only thing taken being the photos depicting the Surface. We could quickly have a crisis on our hooves if they got out to the public! "
masevent.100.a:0 "We must find it."

masevent.101.t:0 "The Chase Begins"
masevent.101.d:0 "Within the Ministry, every pony is expected to do their part. Failing to report for work duty is a serious offence, one that can carry a hefty punishment if no valid reason can be provided for the absence. So when one of our scientists, Dr. Marigold Miracle, failed to report for her shift, we were quick to send a security officer to her residence. However, upon arriving, he found Dr. Miracle hastily packing her saddlebags. Before he could confront her, she grabbed her bags and teleported away."
masevent.101.a:0 "Search the room!"

masevent.1011.t:0 “Searching For Evidence"
masevent.1011.d:0 "Our top security investigator, Magic Blossom, has been put on this case. Arriving at the scene, he immediately went to work searching the entire dwelling. From the wardrobe to the bathroom cabinet, no stone was left unturned. The onlooking security personnel were impressed by the speed at which he went through the entire residence, searching the entire place top to bottom within a mere 10 minutes. At the end of it, he emerged with a single piece of evidence: one of the stolen Surface photos, presumably left behind due to Dr. Miracle’s haste. With this, we have a culprit for the crime, and a possible idea of where she went.”
masevent.1011.a:0 "Magic Blossom did his job well."

masevent.1012.t:0 "Blossom’s Bizarre Adventure"
masevent.1012.d:0 "Blossom’s first few steps out into the Surface were met with a tremble in the ground, as a giant mutated scorpion came charging out from behind a rock at him. The abomination before him was no match for his might though, and he quickly dispatched it. Following this bit of excitement, he immediately set out into the Wastes. \n \n It would be over two months before he finally came across a settlement with a solid lead. In the time before finding it, he had joined a local Chapter of the Steel Rangers, explored the city of the dead, killed a gang leader, and blown up a military base home to an army of mutants that sought to march upon the entire Wasteland. \n \n Walking among the town, he couldn’t help but think about how it was the most disgusting thing he had ever seen. Scrap shacks, occupied by pathetic filth-coated creatures in the shell of ponies. Coming across what appeared to be an establishment of intoxication, he spoke to the authoritative stallion standing behind the bar. He couldn’t tell if the stallion’s natural fur color was a dark brown, or if he was just that filthy. Managing to suppress a sneer was perhaps the hardest thing he had ever done, as he showed the dirty rag before him a picture of Dr. Miracle. \n \n Surprisingly, the walking bag of dirt actually proved himself useful. He identified her as ‘Señorita Marigold’, a stranger that had come into the town recently. Finally, after his long journey, he had found his target. \n \n Entering a small shack that he was told she resided in, Blossom prepared to put an end to this..."
masevent.1012.a:0 “She gets the drop on him."
masevent.1012.b:0 “She’s completely unprepared."

masevent.102.t:0 "Army vs Committee"
masevent.102.d:0 "In the ensuing days after Blossom had left the ministry in search of the rogue scientist, many of the Ministry’s higher ups were discussing matters of the Ministry’s policies and what the future may hold due to the drastic change of events. One of these policies was on the matter of isolation. The Ministry had seen little of the outside world for the past 200 years, much less venture out into it, and our current minister, Horny Miracle, had considered sending our soldiers out into the Wasteland to claim its lands in the name of the Ministry after the recent recon missions had proved interesting. \n \n A member of the Committee, Mystery Night, had opposed this proposition of taking the Wasteland’s land, as he argued that it would be a waste of resources on our part and could bring dangerous foes upon us. Meanwhile our chief of security, Tough Iron, had argued that seizing Surface land could greatly improve our strength and bring new found wealth and resources, with the Wastelanders being powerless against our superior technology. \n \n The arguments were long and loud, and it is unknown if these arguments would prove useful in our future actions or if they’ll change anything."
masevent.102.a:0 "Idiots."

masevent.1021.t:0 "What is he up for?"
masevent.1021.d:0 "Without Blossom`s constant surveillance, Blessed Touch became more active.
The Minister’s brother, Blessed Touch, is an interesting character who is a concern of the Ministry due to his desire to use our technology to help the wastelanders that we have seen on our recon missions. Magic Blossom was the one assigned to keep an eye on Blessed but with Blossom away on his mission Blessed now has more freedom to do as he please and better interact with those around him. This has led to him gathering a following and the signs of a coup against the Minister are beginning to take shape. If he is not dealt with or Blossom does not return soon the consequences could be disastrous to the Minister."
masevent.1021.a:0 "Interesting."

masevent.110.t:0 "Lockdown"
masevent.110.d:0 "Blossom has not returned from his mission on time and it has been a long while since that passed. The Ministry is in a state of crisis, it is likely that Blossom could be dead at the hooves of the rogue scientist and no one knows where she is or what she’s doing. The Minister has ordered a lockdown of everyone in order to contain the situation and prevent things from getting out of hand, but it is unclear if the lockdown will continue if Blossom is confirmed dead. The Committee is discussing if we should send a message out to Blossom to tell him to return home or if we should trust that he has succeeded in his mission and is on his way back."
masevent.110.a:0 "Send a message to Blossom."
masevent.110.b:0 "No, he will be just fine."

masevent.1101.t:0 "Blossom returns"
masevent.1101.d0:0 "Blossom stares at the letter that was teleported to him moments ago detailing that he should return home to the Ministry, the problem is that he would have to wait to actually enter the vault as it is on lockdown which makes it impossible for him to enter until the lockdown is over. He is obviously furious with this as he has to spend more time out in the cursed wastes. The days that followed were Blossom seeing the ruins that was the wasteland and picking off raiders and slavers as he goes along, checking out the various settlements and in doing so picking up on the happenings of a certain ‘Littlepip’ that the wasteland’s radios wouldn’t shut up about. Eventually Blossom returns to the vault in the hopes that the lockdown was lifted. What happened to him on arrival was..."
masevent.1101.d1:0 "Blossom was successful in dealing with the rogue scientist and had returned home to the Ministry to find that the vault door was locked tight with no way in not even teleportation seemed to be feasible, Blossom deduced that the vault was on lockdown and that he would have to wait for any sign that it was over. Blossom figured he might as well use the time to do something interesting so he went around the wastes to see more of what it’s like. The days that followed were Blossom seeing the ruins that was the wasteland and picking off raiders and slavers as he goes along, checking out the various settlements and in doing so picking up on the happenings of a certain ‘Littlepip’ that the wasteland’s radios wouldn’t shut up about. Eventually Blossom returns to the vault in the hopes that the lockdown was lifted. What happened to him on arrival was..."
masevent.1101.a:0 "Blossom teleports inside and dies. "
masevent.1101.b:0 "Blossom enters the ministry safely."
masevent.1101.c:0 "Blossom was shot by a turret on enter."

masevent.11011.t:0 "Accident"
masevent.11011.d1:0 "Upon entering the vault Blossom was suddenly riddled with bullets before he knew it by a security turret that went into assault mode out of nowhere. Within seconds Blossom’s bullet riddled corpse laid on the floor of the vault entrance. Soon after an investigation was opened on weather or not if this was simply a faulty turret malfunction or a deliberate assassination attempt by someone who hated Blossom. Blessed and his following are likely culprits in this incident but evidence and a suspect would need to be found first. Still the incident of Blossom’s death is certain to shake the core of the Ministry."
masevent.11011.d2:0 "Upon entering the vault Blossom suddenly came under fire of a security turret that went rogue and attempted to kill Blossom, thankfully Blossom was aware of the dangers and had teleported far away from the turret before Blossom could be harmed. Soon after an investigation was opened on weather or not this was a faulty turret or if this had been an assassination attempt by someone who wanted Blossom dead. One of Blessed’s followers is a likely culprit but whether or not that;s the case is yet to be deduced. What is certain that this event will shake the Ministry to its core."

He was obviously very resistant against this and it took a number of guards to subdue him. In the ruckus the guards yelled; “welcome to ‘horny’ jail” among other obscenities. Eventually he complied but as time went on he continued to make several attempts at escape, all ending in failure. After a while he gave up on his attempts and is now always seen in a depressive state, but at least he won’t cause trouble to anyone anymore."
