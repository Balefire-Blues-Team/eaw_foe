### FOCUS TREE ###

### Remember: no "Stable".
### Remember: you are not forced to write giant texts for focuses. Mystery`s tree is more event-oriented.

#Feel free to add any event if after consulting about it with Genri(Minister).

#TL;DR: Technical stuff. 
#If you are not into it, just write it down, I will adapt the system.

#Also let me explain the system a little bit. Events 0-99 reserved for technical events, in case any needed. Events 100-199 reserved for starter focuses and universal events, that can be used in different political ways. Events 200-299 reserved for Mystery Night only. If an event is a part of an event tree, you can just add it's number of events after it's parent event, for example "masevent.1011" or "masevent.10101".

masevent.100.t:0 "Stolen Photo"
masevent.100.d:0 "For the past 200 years, the Ministry has been operating under the assumption that little was left of the Surface, save for radioactive ruins and mutated monstrosities from beyond pony imagination. This has heavily influenced the perception of those within our ranks, and has gone a long way towards maintaining stability. However, a recent recon mission to the Surface discovered that our projections were entirely off. Not only were radiation suits unnecessary for their mission, but they actually found relatively unmutated plant-life, and signs of animal life. This has the potential to shake our Ministry to it’s very core if it were to get out. As a result, the entire recon team has been sworn to secrecy and placed under constant surveillance, and the photographs taken have been locked into the Minister’s safe. \n \n Late last night, the Minister’s office was broken into. His safe was broken into, with the only thing taken being the photos depicting the Surface. We could quickly have a crisis on our hooves if they got out to the public! "
masevent.100.a:0 "We must find it."

masevent.101.t:0 "The Chase Begins"
masevent.101.d:0 "Within the Ministry, every pony is expected to do their part. Failing to report for work duty is a serious offence, one that can carry a hefty punishment if no valid reason can be provided for the absence. So when one of our scientists, Dr. Marigold Miracle, failed to report for her shift, we were quick to send a security officer to her residence. However, upon arriving, he found Dr. Miracle hastily packing her saddlebags. Before he could confront her, she grabbed her bags and teleported away."
masevent.101.a:0 "Search the room!"

masevent.1011.t:0 "Searching For Evidence"
masevent.1011.d:0 "Our top security investigator, Magic Blossom, has been put on this case. Arriving at the scene, he immediately went to work searching the entire dwelling. From the wardrobe to the bathroom cabinet, no stone was left unturned. The onlooking security personnel were impressed by the speed at which he went through the entire residence, searching the entire place top to bottom within a mere 10 minutes. At the end of it, he emerged with a single piece of evidence: one of the stolen Surface photos, presumably left behind due to Dr. Miracle’s haste. With this, we have a culprit for the crime, and a possible idea of where she went."
masevent.1011.a:0 "Magic Blossom did his job well."

masevent.1012.t:0 "Blossom’s Bizarre Adventure"
masevent.1012.d:0 "Blossom’s first few steps out into the Surface were met with a tremble in the ground, as a giant mutated scorpion came charging out from behind a rock at him. The abomination before him was no match for his might though, and he quickly dispatched it. Following this bit of excitement, he immediately set out into the Wastes. \n \n It would be over two months before he finally came across a settlement with a solid lead. In the time before finding it, he had joined a local Chapter of the Steel Rangers, explored the city of the dead, killed a gang leader, and blown up a military base home to an army of mutants that sought to march upon the entire Wasteland. \n \n Walking among the town, he couldn’t help but think about how it was the most disgusting thing he had ever seen. Scrap shacks, occupied by pathetic filth-coated creatures in the shell of ponies. Coming across what appeared to be an establishment of intoxication, he spoke to the authoritative stallion standing behind the bar. He couldn’t tell if the stallion’s natural fur color was a dark brown, or if he was just that filthy. Managing to suppress a sneer was perhaps the hardest thing he had ever done, as he showed the dirty rag before him a picture of Dr. Miracle. \n \n Surprisingly, the walking bag of dirt actually proved himself useful. He identified her as \"Señorita Marigold\", a stranger that had come into the town recently. Finally, after his long journey, he had found his target. \n \n Entering a small shack that he was told she resided in, Blossom prepared to put an end to this..."
masevent.1012.a:0 "She gets the drop on him."
masevent.1012.b:0 "She’s completely unprepared."

masevent.102.t:0 "Army vs Committee"
masevent.102.d:0 "In the ensuing days after Blossom had left the ministry in search of the rogue scientist, many of the Ministry’s higher ups were discussing matters of the Ministry’s policies and what the future may hold due to the drastic change of events. One of these policies was on the matter of isolation. The Ministry had seen little of the outside world for the past 200 years, much less venture out into it, and our current minister, Horny Miracle, had considered sending our soldiers out into the Wasteland to claim its lands in the name of the Ministry after the recent recon missions had proved interesting. \n \n A member of the Committee, Mystery Night, had opposed this proposition of taking the Wasteland’s land, as he argues that it would be a waste of resources on our part and could bring dangerous foes upon us. Meanwhile our chief of security, Tough Iron, had argued that seizing Surface land could greatly improve our strength and bring new found wealth and resources, with the Wastelanders being powerless against our superior technology. \n \n The arguments were long and loud, and it is unknown if these arguments would prove useful in our future actions or if they’ll change anything."
masevent.102.a:0 "Idiots."

masevent.1021.t:0 "What is he up for?"
masevent.1021.d:0 "Without Blossom`s constant surveillance, Blessed Touch became more active. The Minister’s brother, Blessed Touch, is an interesting character who is a concern of the Ministry due to his desire to use our technology to help the wastelanders that we have seen on our recon missions. Magic Blossom was the one assigned to keep an eye on Blessed but with Blossom away on his mission Blessed now has more freedom to do as he please and better interact with those around him. This has led to him gathering a following and the signs of a coup against the Minister are beginning to take shape. If he is not dealt with or Blossom does not return soon the consequences could be disastrous to the Minister."
masevent.1021.a:0 "Interesting."

masevent.110.t:0 "Lockdown"
masevent.110.d:0 "Blossom has not returned from his mission on time and it has been a long while since that passed. The Ministry is in a state of crisis, it is likely that Blossom could be dead at the hooves of the rogue scientist and no one knows where she is or what she’s doing. The Minister has ordered a lockdown of everyone in order to contain the situation and prevent things from getting out of hand, but it is unclear if the lockdown will continue if Blossom is confirmed dead. The Committee is discussing if we should send a message out to Blossom to tell him to return home or if we should trust that he has succeeded in his mission and is on his way back."
masevent.110.a:0 "Send a message to Blossom."
masevent.110.b:0 "No, he will be just fine."

masevent.1101.t:0 "Blossom returns"
masevent.1101.d0:0 "Blossom stares at the letter that was teleported to him moments ago detailing that he should return home to the Ministry, the problem is that he would have to wait to actually enter the vault as it is on lockdown which makes it impossible for him to enter until the lockdown is over. He is obviously furious with this as he has to spend more time out in the cursed wastes. The days that followed were Blossom seeing the ruins that was the wasteland and picking off raiders and slavers as he goes along, checking out the various settlements and in doing so picking up on the happenings of a certain \"Littlepip\" that the wasteland’s radios wouldn’t shut up about. Eventually Blossom returns to the vault in the hopes that the lockdown was lifted. What happened to him on arrival was..."
masevent.1101.d1:0 "Blossom was successful in dealing with the rogue scientist and had returned home to the Ministry to find that the vault door was locked tight with no way in not even teleportation seemed to be feasible, Blossom deduced that the vault was on lockdown and that he would have to wait for any sign that it was over. Blossom figured he might as well use the time to do something interesting so he went around the wastes to see more of what it’s like. The days that followed were Blossom seeing the ruins that was the wasteland and picking off raiders and slavers as he goes along, checking out the various settlements and in doing so picking up on the happenings of a certain \"Littlepip\" that the wasteland’s radios wouldn’t shut up about. Eventually Blossom returns to the vault in the hopes that the lockdown was lifted. What happened to him on arrival was..."
masevent.1101.a:0 "Blossom teleports inside and dies. "
masevent.1101.b:0 "Blossom enters the ministry safely."
masevent.1101.c:0 "Blossom was shot by a turret on enter."

masevent.11011.t:0 "Accident"
masevent.11011.d1:0 "Upon entering the vault Blossom was suddenly riddled with bullets before he knew it by a security turret that went into assault mode out of nowhere. Within seconds Blossom’s bullet riddled corpse laid on the floor of the vault entrance. Soon after an investigation was opened on weather or not if this was simply a faulty turret malfunction or a deliberate assassination attempt by someone who hated Blossom. Blessed and his following are likely culprits in this incident but evidence and a suspect would need to be found first. Still the incident of Blossom’s death is certain to shake the core of the Ministry."
masevent.11011.d2:0 "Upon entering the vault Blossom suddenly came under fire of a security turret that went rogue and attempted to kill Blossom, thankfully Blossom was aware of the dangers and had teleported far away from the turret before Blossom could be harmed. Soon after an investigation was opened on weather or not this was a faulty turret or if this had been an assassination attempt by someone who wanted Blossom dead. One of Blessed’s followers is a likely culprit but whether or not that;s the case is yet to be deduced. What is certain that this event will shake the Ministry to its core."
masevent.11011.a:0 "Fine."
masevent.11011.b:0 "We will find who is guilty."

masevent.120.t:0 "Who am I?" #This is fine.
masevent.120.d:0 "The Ministry is at a point in which its fate will change forever, its 200 year isolation is coming to an end, and its fate will likely have an imprint on the fate of the wasteland itself. The ministry itself has changed much recently in its leading up to this point, and its leader is ready to take on the new struggles the ministry will face and eventually the wasteland will know that the Ministry of Arcane Sciences is alive and well and ready to change everything. The only question now is who leads it, so, who are you?"
masevent.120.a:0 "I am Horny Miracle."
masevent.120.b:0 "I am Mystery Night."
masevent.120.c:0 "I am Blessed Touch."
masevent.120.e:0 "I am Tough Iron."

masevent.200.t:0 "Prepare"
masevent.200.d:0 "With new information regarding the wasteland trickling in to the public conscious our dwellers are becoming paranoid of the many threats in the wasteland that were described by these reports. Raiders that kill at a wim, slavers that capture innocent ponies and put them into slavery, armies of griffons roaming the wasteland as ruthless mercenaries, massive monsters that rip and tear ina instant, and much more. Many of our dwellers are becoming fearful that when or if we venture that these threats will be the end of us all. The minister has declared that measures would have to be taken in order to properly defend our vault and to defend it well."
masevent.200.a:0 "I need to take action."

masevent.201.t:0 "Talk with the minister"
masevent.201.d:0 "\"You must understand that as soon as we walk out those doors armies of filthy wastelanders will discover us and pillage our vault of all of its technology and valuables!\" Mystery had been in a talk with the Minister trying to convince him that taking the Ministry into the wasteland will be fatal to us all and that he should call off our actions in the wasteland. The Minister is insistent that the Ministry’s involvement in the wasteland is important to its future and that the Minister is not going to be convinced otherwise. This begging dragged on for another hour before Mystery gave up and left the Minister’s office. Mystery is distraught, if the Minister continues with this pointless endeavor it will bring ruin to the Ministry and all of its dwellers."
masevent.201.a:0 "That wasn't worth it."

masevent.202.t:0 "Stop the recon mission"
masevent.202.d:0 "\"Listen if you don’t cease your absurd bullshit operations in the wasteland I and the committee will personally toss you out of this vault with bullet holes in every part of your body!!!\" Mystery screamed at the Minister, demanding that he cease all activity in the wasteland and concede that he will not do anything with the wasteland again. Unfortunately for Mystery the Minister did not budge. This had all started with Mystery barging into the Minister’s office and demanding that he stop with the recon missions and it eventually devolved into Mystery screaming at Horny at the top of her lungs that the continuation of these expeditions will be the death of everyone in the Ministry. Still, Horny did not budge, and Mystery had stormed off in more fury than she had ever felt in her life. This was going nowhere, and it is paramount that she will have to take matters into her own hooves."
masevent.202.a:0 "Idiot."

masevent.203.t:0 "Assault of the cabinet"
masevent.203.d:0 "In a surprising twist of events Mystery Night and her Committee along with several guards stormed the cabinet and arrested the Minister on charges of treason and endangerment of the entire vault. No one was killed in the arrest but several were injured in the process. Mystery Night has proclaimed that she will take charge of the Ministry and will place Horny under house arrest until further notice."
masevent.203.a:0 "Nice."

masevent.204.t:0 "Takeover"
masevent.204.d:0 "After countless sleepless nights of thinking over what Mystery will do in regards to the future of the Ministry and its leadership, eventually coming to the conclusion that Horny is no longer fit to rule and that she will have to take over the Ministry herself. Soon after it was declared that Mystery will take over the Ministry and her first acts is the suspension of all Ministry expeditions into the wasteland and the scrubbing of all information about the wasteland. In regards to Horny he was transferred to a holding cell in the vault’s jail and is currently facing a life sentence for his crimes. \n \n The future of the sixth Minister is uncertain, but what is certain is that the isolation of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences will continue, unless the wasteland comes knocking at the gates."
masevent.204.a:0 "To the greater future!"

masevent.205.t:0 "Horny imprisoned"
masevent.205.d:0 "It was decided that in order to prevent riots from the imprisonment of former Minister Horny he would be placed on a permanent house arrest with detectives constantly watching his every move, in order to ensure that he does not escape or cause any trouble. He was obviously very resistant against this and it took a number of guards to subdue him. In the ruckus the guards yelled; \"welcome to \"horny\" jail\" among other obscenities. Eventually he complied but as time went on he continued to make several attempts at escape, all ending in failure. After a while he gave up on his attempts and is now always seen in a depressive state, but at least he won’t cause trouble to anyone anymore."
masevent.205.a:0 "Now it is safer."
