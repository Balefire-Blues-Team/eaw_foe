  foe_stability_dec_desc:0 "In these times of strife, our people are in desperate need of hope. Hope we can give them with a series of inspirational and optimistic speeches."
  foe_stability_water_dec:0 "Distribute Water"
  foe_stability_water_dec_desc:0 "Water is a scarce commodity in much of the Wasteland. Many families within our borders struggle to get enough to survive and what they do get is often irradiated. We shall see to it that purified water is distributed as widely as we can, so as to ease the suffering of our people."
  foe_war_support_dec:0 "Praise Our Guardians"
  foe_war_support_dec_desc:0 "Even now, our brave soldiers protect us from all that could do us harm. They stand ever vigilant, day and night, making sure that we are all safe and sound. Let us show them our appreciation with a celebration in their honor!"
  foe_war_support_2_dec:0 "Rally the Nation"
  foe_war_support_2_dec_desc:0 "This is a dark time for all of us. Our enemies seek to tear us down, to kill us, and to destroy our very way of life. If we are to survive as one people, we must fight as one people. For if we fall, we shall all die as one people."
  foe_research_dec:0 "Study Wartime Innovations"
  foe_research_dec_desc:0 "Wartime Equestria was always innovating, creating all sorts of amazing technologies across both civilian and military industries. By studying their advances, we believe we could begin to replicate some of them and advance our own scientific capabilities."

  foe_rationing_dec:0 "Ration Food Supplies"
  foe_rationing_dec_desc:0 ""
  foe_building_dec:0 "Salvage Old Materials"
  foe_building_dec_desc:0 "There are all sorts of useful materials just lying around, from concrete to steel. Why don't we put them to use in our own construction efforts? Sure, the end result may not be the most structurally sound, but survivors can't be choosers in the post-apocalypse."
