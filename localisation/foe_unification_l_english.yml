 unification.2.d:0 "Early this morning, Old Appleloosa declared the formation of the 'Grand Appleloosa Confederacy'.\nTheir new President, Charming Luck, has worked for years to revive the Mixie ideals in his nation, and has slowly consolidated power and territory throughout Grand Appleloosa. Now, with the Capture of Hoof City, all major centres in Grand Appleloosa are under confederate control, making them a major power in the Wasteland.\nIn a Radio-Broadcast Charming Luck emphasized that the Confederacy stands for the security of its borders and Citizens, strong rights for its member States, as well as  more 'Traditional' form of Slavery, unlike the Factory Slaves of Fillydelphia.\nThe New Nation stands poised to take advantage of instability in the region, and might very well become a threat to the Entire South in the Future."

 unification.3.d:0 "For Centuries the various tribes and clans of the Foal Mountains have warred bitterly against one another, but now the fighting has come to an end.\nAll the tribes now stand united beneath a single banner, a strong enough unifying force having finally arisen that was able to curtail generations of tribalism and animosity to create a coherent Empire.\nThe hardy tribesponies of the Mountains will make a strong foundation, though it is already clear that the newly formed Empire seeks to expand further, Fillydelphia being their main ambition.\nUnited, they just might stand a chance against the Titans of the heartlands..."
 unification.3.a:0 "Interesting"
 
 unification.4.t:0 "The Moonlit Crusade"
 unification.4.d:0 "Worrying news reached us from the Foal Mountains today:\nIt appears that all the tribes have been subjugated by Religious Fanatics from the Green Valley Tribe.\nSaid fanatics worship an entity known as the 'Voice of the Moon', which they insist is neither Luna nor Nightmare Moon. In the name of their mysterious Deity they have warred with, and subjugated all nearby tribes, forming a formidable Empire in the process.\nNow, their Prophet has called on them to spread their faith further, by going onto a grand Crusade to spread the word of the moon to all corners of the Wasteland. Non-believers are reportedly being treated extremely harshly being forced to either convert, be enslaved or die. The militant and subversive nature of this Religion will likely prove hard to snuff out, and it seems that the Crusaders are here to stay."
