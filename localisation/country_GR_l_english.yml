### Opening Focuses ###
GR_basecamp:0 "Basecamp"
GR_basecamp_desc:0 "One of the first priorities of a raider gang is to establish a base of operations to use to store and protect the spoils of our murdering spree. Fortunately, the Wasteland has plenty of viable places to establish our base."

GR_traderoutes:0 "Trade Routes"
GR_traderoutes_desc:0 "Now that we have a base to store our stuff, we need to set up outposts near known trade routes. Not only will this let us control those routes, but it will also let everyone know that this is our turf."

### EVENTS ###
##############

GR.1.title:0 "The Camp"
GR.1.desc:0 "We raiders might be a gang of ponies who loot and kill the less fortunate, but we still need a secure place for us to stash our loot and rest. The Boss has sent out several groups to search for a place that we can easily convert into a well defended basecamp. Out of the several groups, only four groups actually tried to find viable locations. The others just went off to go dose up on chems. The first group stumbled upon an abandoned factory. The second group came back covered in blood and told us about a recently pillaged settlement. The third group told us about a wartime military base. Unfortunately, the base had been looted a long time ago. On the plus side, that also meant all the automated defences were cleared out. The last group suggested a ghoul infested subway. The Boss gladly ordered that group to clear out the subway and we never heard of them again. Now we just need to choose which location to turn into our new basecamp."
GR.1.a:0 "The Abandoned Factory" 
GR.1.b:0 "The Settlement"
GR.1.c:0 "The Wartime Military Facility"

GR.2.title:0 "Slaves"
GR.2.desc:0 "Once upon a time, in the magical Wasteland of Equestria, there was a smart raider. She was so smart that she figured out that her gang could take living captives during their raids, and could put them to use doing whatever they wanted! Other gangs saw this and quickly began doing the same. Thus, slavery quickly became a common practice all across the Wasteland. Or so the legend goes. \n \n Now our own gang needs to decide how to handle any slaves we capture. One of our smarter raiders came up with the idea of using them to make weapons. Another much larger raider took a break from playing hoofball using various body parts to loudly suggest we just use them has decoration. Finally, one particularly drugged-out raider suggested we sell them for caps, with which to buy more chems. Who should we listen to?"
GR.2.a:0 "'Think about it, Boss. They're able bodies that can make weapons for us.'" 
GR.2.b:0 "'USE THEIR GUTS AS GARLANDS!'"
GR.2.c:0 "'More caps means more dash! And I really need more dash.'"

GR.3.title:0 "Trade Routes"
GR.3.desc:0 "Now that we've got our basecamp set up, we need to make sure ponies know that this is our turf now. The Boss has ordered some of our raiders to go out and pester the trade routes. This will ensure that the most ponies possible are informed of our rule, while also netting us some profit. How should we deal with the traders themselves though?"
GR.3.a:0 "Kill 'em all!" 
GR.3.b:0 "If they pay, they live. Simple as that."

GR.4.title:0 "Growing Our Base"
GR.4.desc:0 "Soon after we built our basecamp and secured our territory, a number of other local gangs decided to try to pick a fight with us. Needless to say, that didn't end well for them. The remnants of their gangs were quick to join us, often without a choice in the matter. However, our gang wasn't prepared for such a large influx in recruits. We need more weapons to arm them all, more shacks for them to live in, and better roads to handle the higher amount of traffic. Unfortunately, we can only focus on one problem at a time. Which of these should we focus on first?"
GR.4.a:0 "How can they be raiders without weapons?" 
GR.4.b:0 "Focus on building shacks. Everyone needs shelter." 
GR.4.c:0 "I can't even go to the shitter without running into a dozen other raiders. Expand the roads!" 

GR.5.title:0 "Slave Workforce"
GR.5.desc:0 "The makeshift workshop was packed to the brim with filthy slaves, working back to back and shoulder to shoulder. The heat was as relentless as the work, and many slaves silently prayed for their shift to be over soon. They wouldn't be allowed a single moment of rest until their overseer decided that they had worked enough for the day. Some days, this would be before the sun even went down. Others, they would be forced to work well into the night. \n \n At the end of one line of workbenches, a slave collapsed. She was but a filly, still a blankflank, and the heat mixed with the hard work had been far too much for her. The overseer was quick to notice, and ordered a couple of other slaves to drag her back to the slave pens. When she woke up, she would be expected to go right back to work."
GR.5.a:0 "Such is life for a slave." 

GR.6.title:0 "Slave Decorations"
GR.6.desc:0 "A caravan made its way down the ruins of an old road, once one of the highways that had connected all of Equestria. The guards casually chatted with one another, while a tag-along scavenger hum med a small tune to himself. Suddenly, the merchant running the caravan called for everyone to stop. The guards drew their rifles, as the scavenger asked the merchant what was going on. In response, the merchant slowly raised his hoof and pointed at a ruin in front of them. \n \n There, perched on an old rooftop, was a macabre monument comprised of what seemed to be rotting and decaying corpses. A pillar made of bone stretched into the air, with jagged ribs coming out of it like branches on a tree. Impaled on those branches were various bodyparts, some intact and others not so much. The whole thing was covered in dried blood, painting it a red-tinted black. \n \n The sight was a grisly one, and the scavenger was quick to lose his lunch. The merchant had gone pale, and looked only a moment away from doing the same, but was still able to calmly order everyone to turn back."
GR.6.a:0 "What a horrifying sight."

GR.7.title:0 "Slave Auctions"
GR.7.desc:0 "Today was a busy day in the market, as it always was when an auction was taking place. A dozen slaves had been 'obtained' to be sold off to the highest bidder. They ranged from young village mares to battle-weathered former caravan guards, with a wide variety in-between. The first to be sold off would be a young buck, barely old enough to have his cutie mark. He was fortunate enough that his buyer was a rock-farm owner who only needed another body for manual labor. Many of the other slaves had much worse fates awaiting them."
GR.7.a:0 "Let the caps flow in."

GR.8.title:0 "Take Control Of The Villages"
GR.8.desc:0 "The Boss sent a band of raiders to every village in the area to ensure that they understood who was in charge. Most of them let our raiders in without any problems and assured us that they would do whatever we wanted, so long as we didn't hurt them. A few tried to fight us off though. They of course lost in the end, but it doesn't change the fact that they still were willing to resist us in the first place. Even within the villages that are cooperating, there's still occasional incidents involving a raider going missing and tensions between us and the villagers remains high."
GR.8.a:0 "Perhaps we need to make an example."

GR.10.title:0 "Burn A Village"
GR.10.desc:0 "After the fifth raider this day alone went missing, the Boss decided that enough was enough. A warband was being assembled, composed of some of our strongest and best. One of the villages that had initially resisted our rule, and was continuing to do so, would be made an example of. Every house would be burnt to the ground, anyone that tried to run or stand against us would be killed, and those who surrendered would be enslaved. Hopefully, this would be enough to convince the other villages to not fuck with us."
GR.10.a:0 "This should cower them!"

GR.11.title:0 "More Raiders"
GR.11.desc:0 "Terrified villagers are handed weapons and told which way to charge. If they dare refuse orders, try to retreat, or even turn their head the wrong way, they will quickly find themselves joining the battles casualties."
GR.11.a:0 "They make good cannon fodder."

GR.12.title:0 "The Boss Is Dead"
GR.12.desc:0 "After no new orders being issued for a week, someone finally got up the courage to enter the Boss's room. Inside, all that was found was a corpse. We don't know how it happened, but it seems the Boss is dead. Already, several different raiders are making bids for leadership and the gang is rapidly falling apart. Could this get any worse?"
GR.12.a:0 "This is totally not good."

GR.13.title:0 "Resisting Villages"
GR.13.desc:0 "The villages are openly resisting our rule! Raiders are being pushed out from village after village. With our gang in disarray, we are unable to get up enough bodies to put an end to their rebellion. If we don't get our act together soon, we'll run the risk of losing control of the situation completely."
GR.13.a:0 "Someone needs to do something!"

GR.14.title:0 "The New Boss"
GR.14.desc:0 "One of our raiders has managed to gather enough supporters and weaponry to seize control of the basecamp. They have taken residence in the office of the old Boss, and are now insisting that we refer to them only as the Boss. It seems that the Boss is already hard at work trying to reunify our gang."
GR.14.a:0 "Just in time."

GR.15.title:0 "Reaffirm Control"
GR.15.desc:0 "The Boss has sent out bands of raiders to subdue all the other 'fake bosses'. Though some put up quite a fight, they were no match for our larger and better supplied forces! Raider after raider submitted to the Boss's rule, and now almost all of our old gang is back together. The villages, however, are still refusing to submit to our authority."
GR.15.a:0 "They'll learn."

GR.16.title:0 "Crackdown On Villages"
GR.16.desc:0 "The Boss sent out small bands of raiders to pester each village. Not enough to actually occupy the villages, but enough to keep them from sending anyone to help out any of the other villages. Meanwhile, the Boss took an army of our most loyal raiders and began to assault the villages one by one. Their defences were no match for the full might of our gang and, one by one, they fell. Soon enough, all of them will be back under our control. And this time, they'll learn not to resist our rule.."
GR.16.a:0 "The Boss is pretty smart!"

GR.17.title:0 "Punish Village Leaders"
GR.17.desc:0 "Now that our entire territory is back under our control, we can go about making sure that it stays that way. The leaders of each village will be rounded up and publicly executed in front of all of the other residents of their village. This will ensure that everyone receives the message, and prevent them from ever trying to resist us again. As an added precaution, we'll also be sending more raiders to occupy each and every village."
GR.17.a:0 "The Boss will teach them a lesson!"

GR.18.title:0 "Reward Loyal Raiders"
GR.18.desc:0 "To keep the raiders motivated and eager to fight, the Boss began to hand out rewards. Booze, chems, and caps all go to those who fight the best. Furthermore, the Boss also announced a new 'surprise loot' contest for our raiders! After every battle, every raider would pick a number. Those with the number closest to the one the Boss was thinking of would get the best loot! We believe this is an effective way to encourage our raiders."
GR.18.a:0 "It's fun!"

GR.19.title:0 "Losing Their Grip"
GR.19.desc:0 "Leaderless, unorganized, and fighting amongst themselves, the gang is rapidly falling apart. The villages within their territory have begun to rise up and oppose their former raider overlords. While various warlords fought against one another, the villagers started to not only attack the raiders occupying their homes, but to also begin seizing raider outposts. This threat has led to the gang only growing more divided, as the hordes of angry villagers only grow..."
GR.19.a:0 "This could spell the end for the gang."

GR.20.title:0 "Villagers At The Gate!"
GR.20.desc:0 "As night closed in on the raider basecamp, a small militia of villagers gathered in a nearby ruin. This would be it, the end of the raider tyrants that had plagued them for so long. Wielding scavenged and makeshift weaponry, they charged into the camp. The raiders, caught off guard, were rapidly overwhelmed. Those that weren't killed in the initial attack ran for the hills, as the victorious villagers cheered in victory. This would not be the end, but rather the start of a new beginning."
GR.20.a:0 "A victory for freedom."
