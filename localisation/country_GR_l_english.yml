GR.1.title:0 "The Camp"
GR.1.desc:0 "While we raiders may all be veritable badasses that take no shit from nopony, we can't exactly function as one awesome gang without a base to call our own. Only question is, where the fuck do we set up?"
GR.1.a:0 "An Abandoned Factory" 
GR.1.b:0 "A Former Survivor Camp"
GR.1.c:0 "A Pre-War Military Outpost"

GR.2.title:0 "Slaves"
GR.2.desc:0 "Our slave operations have gone so well that we have a new problem. What do we do with these air breathers. “Why don’t we use them as labor so we can do important shit” A voice calls. “Slaves are in high demand to many other raiders why don’t we sell them like fucking chems” another voice calls. “You know those fucking degenerates would look really good on a stick” another voice calls. What do you choose?"
GR.2.a:0 "Put the new recruits to work!" 
GR.2.b:0 "Use their guts as garlands!"

GR.5.title:0 "Slave Workforce"
GR.5.desc:0 "In the cold lifeless factory a raider walks. “WHY AREN’T YOU DEGENERATES MAKING MORE GUNS” The raider violently yells at the working slaves. A little filly collapses on the factory floor still clutching an half finished pistol barrel in her hooves. One of the nearby slaves runs up to the filly as he checks her pulse “She’s dead” He said, a single tear running down his cheek “WORK YOU DEGENERATE” The raider yells and hits the slave with the butt of his rifle before pushing him back to his workpost. The mother of the filly sobs quitly as she mourns the death of her child. “SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET BACK TO WORK. NO PONY WILL REST UNTIL THESE GUNS ARE  FINISHED” The mother reluctantly goes back to work producing the endless stream of guns as before."
GR.5.a:0 "Get back to work!" 

GR.6.title:0 "Slave Decorations"
GR.6.desc:0 "A raider walks into the holding cell “Which of you degenerates wants to be gifted mercy?”. The room quickly fell silent as the raider inspects each cage carefully. “How about you degenerate?”  “No that’s my mommy” A young filly pleaded from a different cage. everypony looked at the brave filly, sadness filled in many eyes as the guard gave a short grin “Do you want to be next cry baby?”.  The room fell silent again as the raider pulled the slave out of the cage an was brutally maimed right in front of the filly's eyes. A faint crying sound was heard from the room as the raider left the mare's body once he had what he came for."
GR.6.a:0 "Seems she will have to look for a new mommy"

GR.7.title:0 "Slave Auctions"
GR.7.desc:0 "“Mommy what’s gonna happen?” A little filly said as the filly looked up to her mother in the cage beside her. The mother grabbed the filly’s hoof tightly doing her best to comfort her. “Here we have one male slave for just 100 caps” A raider points towards a nearby cage “I’ll take em” One opportunistic buyer yells. “Up next we have one female for 50 caps” “I’ll take her”. The same buyer yells, the filly starts to cry as she desperately tries to reach her mother through the bars of her cage. What is happing to her mom? “And last we have one crying foal for the low low price of 25 caps” I’ll take the tiny bastard” says a different buyer this time.  As the filly and mother are pulled of the makeshift stage they both realize they aren’t gonna meet each other again. As the sad filly weeps the mother sings an old pre war song “I’ll ask where’s been for all of these years...” "

GR.12.title:0 "The Boss is Dead"
GR.12.desc:0 "After having heard nothing from our Boss for more then a day, Somepony finally decided to check up on him in his bedroom. What they found was the corpse of the Boss with a whole stash of Dash sprawled around his room. Unfortunally all the Dash ampules seem to be empty. Our Boss most likely died from being a greedy bitch who took all the Dash himself."
GR.12.a:0 "Who's going to keep us in line now?"

GR.13.title:0 "Resisting Villages"
GR.13.desc:0 "Somehow the villages seem to found out about our leader being dead. We are getting reports that villagers are starting to rise up and assault or outright kill our men. One of the villages already took back control of their town and are currently sending armed troops to help liberate the other villages. Meanwhile most of the raiders refuse to follow any order or have turned against each other, looting and stealing from each other or the base. If nothing is done, we will soon lose complete control of our territory."
GR.13.a:0 "Who cares. Let's raid the armory!"

GR.14.title:0 "The New Boss"
GR.14.desc:0 "By some miracle, one of the local raider bosses decided to step up and has subdued the majority of the raiders at the basecamp. He currently resides in the home of our old Boss to further assert his claim as the new leader of the camp. Some still dare to challenge him but order has mostly returned at the Basecamp."
GR.14.a:0 "Now we just need to regain control of our territory"

GR.15.title:0 "Reaffirm Control"
GR.15.desc:0 "Already our Boss has started sending out loyal raiders equipped with the best armor and biggest guns to either put the still resisting raiders in line or kill them if they refuse. With most of our outposts and roadblocks back in control the Boss sent one group to a village to take back control but encountered heavy resistance from the villagers who fortified their town. The raiders were forced to retreat after experiencing heavy losses"
GR.15.a:0 "Those villagers will pay for killing our men!"

GR.16.title:0 "Crackdown on Villages"
GR.16.desc:0 "The Boss has sent out small groups of raiders to each town. Not enough to take on the armed villagers but enough to keep them from reinforcing each other. Meanwhile the Boss and an army of his most loyal raiders are assaulting the villages one at a time. The villagers are unable to properly defend against our raider army without support from their neighbours. Once a town has been reconquered the army will head to the next town while the small group will keep the villagers from rising up again. Soon each town will be back under our control."
GR.16.a:0 ""

GR.17.title:0 "Punish Village Leaders"
GR.17.desc:0 "Now that each town in our territory is back under control we will make sure they will never resist our rule again. that is why as of now all the village leaders are being round up and forced to the center of each village where a noose will be waiting for them. The village leaders will be hanged and their position will be taken over by one of the Boss' loyal raiders who will keep the town in check. We have been to soft on them for a long time. It is time the towns will contribute for the protection we provide them."
GR.17.a:0 ""

GR.18.title:0 "Reward Loyal Raiders"
GR.18.desc:0 "To keep the raiders motivated and eager to fight the Boss began rewarding his loyal raiders with better housing in the center of the camp, keeping his most loyal troops close to him. Raiders who fought well in battle against the armed villagers where rewarded with drugs. Each killed pony a raider would kill would be rewarded with an extra ampule of Dash. If a raider managed to capture and murder an wounded villager he would receive an extra reward in the form of booze. The more brutal and creative the more booze the raider would earn. This alone has sparked the fighting spirit back into the raiders who are now eager to go out to raid and murder any hostile they could find."
