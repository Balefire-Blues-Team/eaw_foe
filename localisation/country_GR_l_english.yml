A little filly collapses on the factory floor still clutching an half finished pistol barrel in her hooves. One of the nearby slaves runs up to the filly as he checks her pulse “She’s dead” He said, a single tear running down his cheek “WORK YOU DEGENERATE” The raider yells and hits the slave with the butt of his rifle before pushing him back to his workpost. The mother of the filly sobs quitly as she mourns the death of her child. “SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET BACK TO WORK. NO PONY WILL REST UNTIL THESE GUNS ARE  FINISHED” The mother reluctantly goes back to work producing the endless stream of guns as before."
GR.5.a:0 "Get back to work!" 

GR.6.title:0 "Slave Decorations"
GR.6.desc:0 "A raider walks into the holding cell “Which of you degenerates wants to be gifted mercy?”. The room quickly fell silent as the raider inspects each cage carefully. “How about you degenerate?”  “No that’s my mommy” A young filly pleaded from a different cage. everypony looked at the brave filly, sadness filled in many eyes as the guard gave a short grin “Do you want to be next cry baby?”.  The room fell silent again as the raider pulled the slave out of the cage an was brutally maimed right in front of the filly's eyes. A faint crying sound was heard from the room as the raider left the mare's body once he had what he came for."
GR.6.a:0 "Seems she will have to look for a new mommy"

GR.7.title:0 "Slave Auctions"
GR.7.desc:0 "“Mommy what’s gonna happen?” A little filly said as the filly looked up to her mother in the cage beside her. The mother grabbed the filly’s hoof tightly doing her best to comfort her. “Here we have one male slave for just 100 caps” A raider points towards a nearby cage “I’ll take em” One opportunistic buyer yells. “Up next we have one female for 50 caps” “I’ll take her”. The same buyer yells, the filly starts to cry as she desperately tries to reach her mother through the bars of her cage. What is happing to her mom? “And last we have one crying foal for the low low price of 25 caps” I’ll take the tiny bastard” says a different buyer this time.  As the filly and mother are pulled of the makeshift stage they both realize they aren’t gonna meet each other again. As the sad filly weeps the mother sings an old pre war song “I’ll ask where’s been for all of these years...” "
