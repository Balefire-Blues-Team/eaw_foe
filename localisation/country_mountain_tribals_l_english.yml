 HIT_event.1.d:0 "The pony who managed to unite most of the Foal Mountains, Overhill, is offering us a chance to join him in an alliance. Seeing as his troops have already conquered vast stretches of land, it might be a good idea to join him and benefit from the protection of his new empire. However, this would also mean that we are expected to help fight and die for him."
 HIT_event.1.a:0 "A good idea. Overhill shall be our friend!"
 HIT_event.1.b:0 "We have no interest in helping a madpony."
 
 HIT_event.2.t:0 "The Crystal Caverns Refuse"
 HIT_event.2.a:0 "The dogs of the Crystal Caverns have refused our most generous offer of an alliance. We are not sure how they could be so blind and not recognize the rising star that is our nation, but they still did. Inky Lotus has managed to convince Overhill that this is merely a momentary lapse of judgement by the dogs, and that they may come around eventually, so war is not neccesary."
 HIT_event.2.a:0 "Stupid dogs."

 
 
 GRV_event.1.t:0 "The Voice in the Dark"
 GRV_event.1.d:0 "A pony sits alone at the center of the great Wind-Park. The Spirit's Totems rise far above, that most holy source of power that has allowed Green Valley to prosper for so long. If one were to listen very closely, they could almost hear the faint voices of the ancestors carried forward in the wind. Next to this lonesome pony is a single box, from which a mythical green glow comes. This box is the holy beacon through which the Spirits communicate with the mortal realm, sharing the words and wisdom of the Moon above.\n \n[Root.GetLeader] continues to sit still and wait. The Spirits will come in time, as they always have and always shall. Suddenly, with a crackle and a flicker, the Spirits begin to speak in their inpony voices. \n \n'...wel...joy...Luna...spread harmony throughout the land!'. With a final crackle, the Spirits fall silent. A moment later and the lone pony would stand up, confident in what their purpose in this world is."

 GRV_event.2.t:0 "The Voice in the Dark"
 GRV_event.2.d:0 "A pony sits alone in the center of the so-called 'Wind-Park'. Windmills rise far into the air around him, harvesting the energy of the wind and providing for the ponies of Green Valley. The wind roars through the air, which the lesser minded could misintepret as something mystical. Thankfully, Spark is not a lesser pony. He wonders if this could be it, if the noise of the wind produces the supposed 'Spirits' that the tribe has allowed to guide them for so long. \n \n Suddenly, with a flicker and a crackle, a terminal turns on before him. Out of a speaker in desperate need of maintenance comes a computerized voice, speaking broken and distorted words. Is this it? A simple terminal? Spark's not entirely certain how he should feel in that moment. Surprised? Disappointed? It matters not, for a moment later an idea comes to him. The shaman's do not listen to Spark himself, but they hold this simple machine to be the word of their God. A machine that is little more than a tool, and that can be made to say whatever one wishes. The idea develops into a plan, and the lone pony gets to work."
