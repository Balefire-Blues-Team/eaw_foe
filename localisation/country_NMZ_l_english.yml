 NMZ_emissary_idea:0 "The Emissary"
 NMZ_emissary_idea_desc:0 "Few have ever seen an Alicorn with their own eyes, but the story of these winged nightmares prowling the wastes in search of ponies to snatch away is one many wastelanders have heard in recent years. While few are willing to openly trust such a creature’s word at face value, it hasn’t proven a threat to us… yet,\n\nEven with its uniquely extensive knowledge of logistical and medical spellcraft, can we really trust its claims of independence? What does this Emissary gain, and why did she come to us?"

 NMZ_shuzu_idea:0 "Shuyu"
 NMZ_shuzu_idea_desc:0 "At only two-hundred and thirty, this dragon has seen much throughout her life. Having lived through and fought in the Great War she has seen the effectiveness of well positioned, well trained creatures first-claw."

 NMZ_sweet_shine_idea:0 "Sweet Shine"
 NMZ_sweet_shine_idea_desc:0 "Knowledge is power and knowing where your enemy has laid his head each night is an excellent example. A lesson long ago learned by the zebra, and one Sweet Shine holds well. The head of policing in Nova Mirazh, her old world SWAT-style tactics and zebra shamanism serve just as well on the battlefield. Just don’t ask where the jazz music and cognac come from."

 NMZ_arcane_gears_idea:0 "Arcane Gears"
 NMZ_arcane_gears_idea_desc:0 "A tinkerer and craftspony by nature with a heart of gold, if he could stop himself from adopting every lost filly and colt that wanders into view then perhaps he could focus more on rebuilding the world more than he’s already trying to... Or sitting in on Council Meetings like he’s supposed to..."

 NMZ_solar_lance_idea:0 "Solar Lance"
 NMZ_solar_lance_idea_desc:0 "Almost as rare as an Alicorn, a Kirin is an unusual sight in the wasteland. A hornless one more so, married to the daughter of a major industrialist, Solar Lance has learned the trade of his father-in-law and is a prominent member of the ruling Council, despite his disinterest in politics."

 NMZ_speakeasy_idea:0 "Speakeasy"
 NMZ_speakeasy_idea_desc:0 "A former mercenary leader with a knack for talking her way into and out of most situations, her position as the Council’s voice beyond Nova Mirzah’s borders is not to be discounted, nor her seat ignored."
