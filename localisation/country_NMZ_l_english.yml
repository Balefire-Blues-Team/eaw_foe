 NMZ_diplomacy_by_direct_means_desc:0 "'It is the duty of our peoples defenders to take the fight to those that would see us bend before them. When the quill fails it falls to the Sword to ensure any threat is dealt with swiftly.'\n§F-Martini Markerlight, Severnayan Shadows.§!"
 
 NMZ_dreams_of_clear_blue:0 "Dreams of a clear blue"
 NMZ_dreams_of_clear_blue_desc:0 "'Centuries ago the skies laid open, calm, free. Now the world is smothered in the grey embrace of the Cloudlayer. To breach it is to incur the wrath of the Grand Pegasi Enclave. Yet there will always be those who yearn to tread the space between the earth and the sky. I salute those willing to contest the skies of this grey, dead world.. Perhaps one day we’ll see a time where the sky is free for all again.'\n§F-Rum Rush, Severnayan Shadows.§!"
 
 NMZ_establish_winter_haven:0 "Establish Winter Haven flight-school"
 NMZ_establish_winter_haven_desc:0 "A simple field, flattened out to create a runway. A few dozen wooden huts to house the cadets. A Control Tower to coordinate the machines, some canvas hangers to store the aircraft and some steel mooring towers for Airships. With some work this can be made a reality, and perhaps we can begin training our pilots on a regular level."
 
 NMZ_establish_air_guard:0 "Establish the Air Guard"
 NMZ_establish_air_guard_desc:0 "'It is the duty of our pilots to ensure that the skies below the clouds remain clear of any threat. Be it a Raider with wings, a Talon raiding party, the Slavers of the West, or the Zebra in the north. We are the defenders of these skies, let none contest that fact.'\n§F-Jericho Siren, former Regulator.§!"
 
 NMZ_steel_wings:0 "Steel Wings"
 NMZ_steel_wings_desc:0 "Two contractors have come forward with unique designs. This aircraft is a far-cry from the gliders and Biplanes we’ve experimented with recently and was made using Wartime Severnayan blueprints. It incorporates four small internal bomb bays, a pair of forward facing autocannons, and a rear mounted machine-gun turret.  Its rugged and tested by its pilot, but until we test it ourselves, this ‘Shturmovik’ is merely an interesting oddity."
 
 NMZ_the_crimson_raider:0 "The Crimson Raider"
 NMZ_the_crimson_raider_desc:0 "'Our fledgling airforce is an unusual assortment of characters, but one stands out amongst his peers. A former Raider from one of the tribes that made up the Coalition, the Jasmine Raiders. During the evacuation the poor pegasus had his wings clipped.. Now he seeks Wings of Steel to return to the sky."

 NMZ_from_school_to_academy_desc:0 ""
 
 NMZ_canvas_hull:0 "Canvas Hull"
 NMZ_canvas_hull_desc:0 "Two contractors have come forward with unique designs. This ‘aircraft’ is undeserving of the name.. This Airship is slow, decently armored, and long ranged. While it lacks an internal bomb-bay its ability to hover beyond the range of most AA weapons is quite useful in a reconnaissance role. It also opens the door to more specialized designs in the future. It shows some promise."
 
 NMZ_expand_airfield_facilities:0 "Expand airfield facilities"
 NMZ_expand_airfield_facilities_desc:0 "Replacing the dirt airstrip with concrete and asphalt is a good start to improving our local facilities. Expanding the existing barracks and hangers to full size permanent structures will also considerably increase our ability to operate training flights, and combat operations should the need arise. With this buildup though comes the risk of attack from above, the addition of an air defense battery should alleviate these concerns."
 
 NMZ_beckoning_skies:0 "Beckoning Skies"
 NMZ_beckoning_skies_desc:0 "We have the knowledge, but require the bodies to put our new aircraft to use. A recruitment drive to renew interest in the Airforce would help alleviate these concerns, though the lack of dedicated facilities should be dealt with quickly as well."
 
 NMZ_wrath_of_the_air:0 "Wrath of the Air"
 NMZ_wrath_of_the_air_desc:0 "Our trainers are split on the tactical approach of our pilots. Jericho Siren, a former Regulator and proponent of the Search and Destroy doctrine believes that the Airforce should focus on the complete destruction of ground forces above all others, while risky some pilots have agreed with him."
 
 NMZ_dropping_the_sky:0 "Dropping the Sky"
 NMZ_dropping_the_sky_desc:0 "An increased focus on ground attack missions has led to an increase in efficiency among our trainees.. Though mock battles have shown an increased vulnerability to enemy aircraft. We still have room to improve."
 
 NMZ_ruling_the_skies:0 "Ruling the Skies"
 NMZ_ruling_the_skies_desc:0 "Our trainers are split on the tactical approach of our pilots. Rum Rush, a former Shadow, has expressed views that the Airforce should focus on clearing the skies first and aiding those on the ground secondary. Her views have gained a fair amount of traction among the cadets and pilots."
 
 NMZ_reviewing_flight_practices:0 "Review Flight-practices"
 NMZ_reviewing_flight_practices_desc:0 "Our formations are growing more coherent with every flight and our pilots are rapidly growing in skill. Its time we reviewed our records and see where we can improve in training, both in the classroom and in the sky."
 
 NMZ_knights_in_the_air:0 "Knights in the Air"
 NMZ_knights_in_the_air_desc:0 "Our pilots have grown to see themselves as defenders of the world below their wings, and some have begun to adopt a hoof-ful of the customs associated with Albion-Chivalry. Some have even added elements of Albion-themed armor and equipment to their uniforms, ranging from chestplates and cuirass to a few curious examples of old Royal Guard armor. While unusual, it has proven its worth defending against shrapnel. Regulations may need to be adjusted."
 
 NMZ_upon_steeds_of_steel:0 "Upon Steeds of Steel"
 NMZ_upon_steeds_of_steel_desc:0 "Our aircraft are among the greatest weapons at our disposal, seconded only by our brave Pilots. Those who brave the skies in defense of those below fly with skillful grace. Its up to us to ensure they receive the best tools for the job."
 
 NMZ_resolve_of_adamantine:0 "Resolve of Adamantine"
 NMZ_resolve_of_adamantine_desc:0 "Some may view diving towards machine-gun, lasers, and cannon-fire with nothing but a thin layer of steel and glass between you and death to be the epitome of insanity. To others it is a test of will to brave that storm and emerge intact with their mission completed. To those with the Resolve to see their job completed, it is a crucible of Heroes."
 
 NMZ_on_a_wing_and_a_prayer:0 "On a Wing and a Prayer"
 NMZ_on_a_wing_and_a_prayer_desc:0 "'Two Hundred years ago, a war ended the world as it was known and ushered forth this wasteland we call home. For Two Hundred years the sky has been stolen from the wasteland and feverishly guarded by the Pegasi of the Enclave. Hidden away in their cities among the clouds, defended by legions of power armored soldiers and flying battleships. Today we contest that might below the clouds, should the Pegasi of Skyfreeze or any other Enclave sky-city seek us in anger, they shall find our pilots ready to meet them.' -Anonymous Wing Commander"
 
 NMZ_guards_no_longer:0 "Guards no Longer!"
 NMZ_guards_no_longer_desc:0 "'From this day on we are no longer Guards. No longer will we wait behind our walls and prepare for an attack. No longer will we watch silently as our borders are probed by Raiders, only responding when they poke too hard. Today, we are Soldiers. Guardians of this land's Freedom, we shall oppose any who wish to force their will upon our charge.' -Martini Markerlight."
 
 NMZ_implement_rank_system:0 "Implement Trooper Rank System"
 NMZ_implement_rank_system_desc:0 "While not a major issue in the past, with the growing levels of squad cooperation, the need for a clear chain of command has become apparent. The Introduction of senior trooper ranks should help limit confusion on the battlefield."
 
 NMZ_establish_training_outposts:0 "Establish Training Outposts"
 NMZ_establish_training_outposts_desc:0 "Outlook Point, a small settlement on the edge of the Wild Quag built into and around the ruins of an abandoned mine, this town has long been a point of contention between Nova Mirzah, The Judiciars, The Paragons, and The Freaks of Fluttershy. Recently though rumors say that a rogue Paragon cleared out the Fluttershy-obsessed Raiders, unfortunately a new gang of some sort has moved into their territory.. Wearing bright white coats of all things. Constructing a defensive outpost in the area and staffing it with our fresh forces should persuade these new-comers from doing anything rash."
 
 NMZ_salvage_sector_13:0 "Salvaging Sector 13"
 NMZ_salvage_sector_13_desc:0 "Long left to rust as part of the original deal between the Shadows and Nova Mirzah’s first Settlers, the industrial area of Sector 13 has finally been designated for salvage operations. Old World records indicate it housed a Nova Gryphonian Military Company arms factory at some point.. Assuming we can find it in the wreckage. The initial operation is already showing results as some ammunition presses have been recovered, along with small amounts of heavy machinery."
 
 NMZ_implement_rank_nco:0 "Implement NCOs"
 NMZ_implement_rank_nco_desc:0 "The Sergeant, long viewed in pre-war books and magazines as a monster of unimaginable carnage, wielding a scattergun and leading from the front, these cigar-chomping, flank-kicking, fiery monsters of death and inspiration are no longer a myth, nor a memory from a dead world. With the rank system of NCO’s added to the squad hierarchy, larger units can be commanded efficiently."
 
 NMZ_unit_coordination_training:0 "Unit Cohesion-Training"
 NMZ_unit_coordination_training_desc:0 "Our soldiers are quite skilled at operating as individuals, however the wasteland experience of fighting alone translates poorly for anything above five or six ponies, moreso if the squad is made up of other races. A lot of work will need to be done to improve our squads ability to work cohesively."
 
 NMZ_standardize_equipment:0 "Standardize Equipment"
 NMZ_standardize_equipment_desc:0 "With access to greater manufacturing capacity we’ve begun issuing our soldiers more standardized equipment. Rifles, an armored helmet, thick overcoat, socks, and boots. Many are thankful for this delightful windfall."

 NMZ_repair_complex_machinery:0 "Repair ancient generators"
 NMZ_repair_complex_machinery_desc:0 "With Salvage operations in Sector 13 still underway some of the equipment that couldn’t be moved has been looked over by our engineers. Shockingly some of the arcane generators in the Sector are still intact, and with some work could be brought back online!"
 
 NMZ_implement_rank_company_command:0 "Company Command"
 NMZ_implement_rank_company_command_desc:0 "Once more an addition to the ranking system is needed as the Captain’s in command are finding it more and more difficult to coordinate their forces. Commissioned Officers commanding the NCO’s and reporting directly to the Captain should help shift the burden to a considerable degree."
 
 NMZ_streamline_command:0 "Streamline Command Protocols"
 NMZ_streamline_command_desc:0 "The Chain of Command is complicated, no-one ever said it was simple. But at times it can be so muddled that it is more a danger to itself than effective against an enemy. Removing excess protocols and training our soldiers more effectively should provide us a tactical advantage. The introduction of radio equipment and cyphers should also increase the effectiveness of our troops, and confuse anyone listening in on our soldiers."
 
 NMZ_guns_for_a_new_age:0 "Guns for a New Age"
 NMZ_guns_for_a_new_age_desc:0 "A set of Wartime Combat Armor, Combat Helmet, an Automatic Rifle, short ranged radio, and a sidearm. There are few things in the wasteland that will stop a well trained, well armed, determined creature."
 
 NMZ_military_ethics:0 "Military Code of Ethics"
 NMZ_military_ethics_desc:0 "Like everypony, our soldiers are bound by the same laws as every Nova Mirzah’n citizen, and are subject to the same punishments for actions done in violation of the law. We will not descend to the same level as the Judiciars."
 
 NMZ_special_formations:0 "Specialized Formations"
 NMZ_special_formations_desc:0 "Flamethrowers, Combat Engineers, Medical Personnel, Snipers. All these specializations and more require extensive amounts of extra training and non-standard equipment, however they are also worth every Cap put into them."
 
 NMZ_expanding_production:0 "Aquire Griffonian Schematics"
 NMZ_expanding_production_desc:0 "While the Holy Griffonian Empire is extremely isolationist, their Colony on Haukland is teeming with Pirates and Smugglers that are eager to trade away some secrets in exchange for materials and Guns for their own operations."
 
 NMZ_salvage_motorized_concept:0 "Salvaging the Motorized Concept"
 NMZ_salvage_motorized_concept_desc:0 "More good news out of Sector 13, a set of blueprints for Equestrian military trucks was recovered from the ruins, more pressingly however is the discovery of the GMC Factory itself. The building is mostly intact, though buried in rubble. Initial surveys show much of its equipment intact, but in dire need of maintenance or repair.. We caught a break here."
 
 NMZ_repair_gmc_factory:0 "Repair GMC Factory"
 NMZ_repair_gmc_factory_desc:0 "Clearing the rubble and reinforcing the walls of the building is the easy part, its concrete, brick, and steel. The real difficulty is in repairing the assembly lines. But with our best engineers on the task, we should see results soon."
 
 NMZ_motorized_combat_battalions:0 "Motorized Combat Battalions"
 NMZ_motorized_combat_battalions_desc:0 "Integrating motorized vehicles into our companies has proven to be a massive boon to both our unit mobility and redeployment abilities. In addition our support personnel can evacuate wounded soldiers at greater rate than before, leading to many ponies surviving wounds that would kill the average waster."
 
 NMZ_implement_rank_battalion_command:0 "Battalion Command"
 NMZ_implement_rank_battalion_command_desc:0 "As our army continues to grow, more officers are needed to keep it organized. Commanding full Battalions in the field effectively is an art form as much as it is a proffession."

 NMZ_spec_ops_command:0 "Spec-Ops Command"
 NMZ_spec_ops_command_desc:0 "Some missions are not suited to normal soldiers. Sneaking through the muck and snow hunting Raiders, assassinating high ranking Slavers, freeing captives within enemy camps without raising an alarm? Asking a normal soldier to do many of these things would end poorly. Special Forces soldiers are drawn from every corner of Nova Mirzah’s armed forces and have access to the best weapons, armor, equipment, and information we can provide them."
 
 NMZ_spec_training:0 "Specialist Training"
 NMZ_spec_training_desc:0 "Despite what some may say, hiding under a box is not always the most effective infiltration method. Perhaps against Raiders, but Slavers, Talon’s? Against these foes specialized methods need to be developed and countermeasures put in place for when infiltrating these groups becomes necessary."

Don’t take my words for fear of the sea boy, for a sailor doesn’t fear the sea, they respect her.' -Admiral Briny Shoals."
 
 NMZ_repair_harbour_heat_exchanger:0 "Repair the Harbor Heat Exchanger"
 NMZ_repair_harbour_heat_exchanger_desc:0 "Long ago the city that operated our harbor put in place a massive purification and heating system to keep the harbor clear of ice and clear out the metal contamination spread by the warships that called it home. As the war progressed these filtration systems were upgraded to handle necrotic contamination, and supposedly could handle worse substances. Now though they lie inactive and ill maintained. Our engineers have decided its time to remedy this failing."
 
 NMZ_expand_de_thawing:0 "Expand De-thawing Operations"
 NMZ_expand_de_thawing_desc:0 "Work on the Exchanger is progressing smoothly, though it's proving more expensive than anticipated. Drawing yet more hooves, talons, and horns to bring the venerable system back online. With more work we should have it returned to functionality."
 
 NMZ_deep_sea_support:0 "Deep Sea Support"
 NMZ_deep_sea_support_desc:0 "Our fishing fleets have long relied on the firepower of the ‘Luna’ to handle the odd sea serpent or monster as they ply the deep oceans in search of untainted fish. The addition of some of our newer designs should provide the ancient destroyer with a vanguard that would bring even the most ardent of dragon pause."
 
 NMZ_legend_of_terror_on_sea:0 "Legend of the ‘Terror on the Sea’"
 NMZ_legend_of_terror_on_sea_desc:0 "A ghoul has arrived from the east aboard a ruined craft of unusual design. A submarine. He claims to have come from the Hawkland Isles which have fallen into disarray, bringing with him what he could. He’s offered to join our navy and serve on the Line, and based on the log-book he carried.. His knowledge of warfare on the sea’s stretches back to a time before the Great War, aboard a vessel of legend. The flagship of the Gryphonian Imperial Fleet, the SuperBattleship Gover."

 NMZ_plan_escort_salvage_operations_desc:0 "With the Heat Exchanger restored the thinner sections of ice have begun to melt, freeing many of the ships that were trapped below.

 NMZ_expand_harbor_services_desc:0 "The ice is breaking away, revealing the treasures of the harbor once more. Even greater, with the ice becoming less of an issue, we can begin repairing some of the dry-docks dotting the old harborfront."
 
 NMZ_the_doctrine_defense:0 "The Doctrine of Defense"
 NMZ_the_doctrine_defense_desc:0 "Usage of our screening vessels to support and defend merchant vessels from incursion by pirates and raiders has been a standard practice, with the raider clans of the Seadogs so close at hoof. A ship traveling unescorted is easy prey to their maneuverable motorboats. The time has come to review our tactics and improve them."
 
 NMZ_legacy_of_kriegsmarine:0 "Legacy of the Kaiserliche Marine"
 NMZ_legacy_of_kriegsmarine_desc:0 "While the submarine, or ‘U-Boot’ as Lindebirdd refers to it, is little more than a floating wreck. The documents and plans aboard the vessel are of far greater value. Beyond that is the discovery of a ‘Paradox’ code machine! While it is beyond our ability to reproduce such a complex machine at current, we can take lessons from its design. Perhaps one day."

 NMZ_sail_corrupted_coasts:0 "To sail the corrupted coasts"
 NMZ_sail_corrupted_coasts_desc:0 "The dangers of the wasteland are not merely confined to the land, many seaborne creatures that once were considered harmless are now a great danger. Mirelurks, Giant Squid, Hydra, even ghoulified seaponies, Sirens. It takes a certain type of pony to risk the waves, and not everyone who joins the Escort Service makes the cut."
 
 NMZ_anti_piracy_training:0 "Anti-Piracy Training"
 NMZ_anti_piracy_training_desc:0 "When a Raider tries to board our vessels, it is best to engage them at long range with superior firepower.

 NMZ_expand_escort_fleet:0 "Expanding the Escort Fleet"

 NMZ_adapt_convoy_schedules_desc:0 "A Capital Ship off your bow, a pair of escorts to port and starboard, and a fifth training in your wake.

 NMZ_advanced_formation_drills:0 "Advanced formation Drills"
 NMZ_advanced_formation_drills_desc:0 "Our Escort ships need to undergo rigorous training to cement the formations used in the minds of their officers.

 NMZ_reheat_the_harbor:0 "Reheat the Harbor"
 NMZ_reheat_the_harbor_desc:0 "With much of the available salvage accounted for, there has been a number of requests from the Exchanger facility to increase output on both the purifier system, and the exchanger itself. Our engineers have ensured us that the system can handle the increased stress."
 
 NMZ_expand_coastguard:0 "Expansion of the Coastal Guard"
 NMZ_expand_coastguard_desc:0 "Our regular patrols of motorboats and small ships have proven effective at halting incursions from the Seadogs, but their continued threat is proof that improvements can be made.

 NMZ_establish_fleet_command:0 "Establish Fleet Command"

 NMZ_purpose_of_lineship:0 "The Purpose of the Line Ship"
 NMZ_purpose_of_lineship_desc:0 "A Line vessel's place is at the center of the battle, it is the speartip of an attack, the hammerblow against the armor of our enemies. It is as much a symbol as it is a weapon. Showing our power to all who see it."
 
 NMZ_anchors_of_the_fleet:0 "Anchors of the Fleet"
 NMZ_anchors_of_the_fleet_desc:0 "A Capital Ship should serve as the center of a fleet, supported by Escort Vessels to screen it from attack. It should deal with anything too heavy for the escorts to handle and armored enough to deter anything lesser."
 
 NMZ_line_of_battle:0 "The Line of Battle"
 NMZ_line_of_battle_desc:0 "An ancient formation dating back to the first Wooden Hulled Warships, the Line of Battle was made up of capital ships, which would present their armored sides to an enemy armada and in turn bring the vast majority of their firepower against them. With the advent of turreted weapons, this tactic remained. It is simple and effective."
 
 NMZ_monsters_on_waves:0 "Monsters on the Waves"
 NMZ_monsters_on_waves_desc:0 "Capital Ships, wood and steel behemoths of the waves, bringing the firepower of entire regiments to bare on a single point. These craft were the mainstay of ancient navies of the Wartime Era, the lessons learned from these craft are not one to be forgotten."
 
 NMZ_combat_coordination:0 "Combat coordination"
 NMZ_combat_coordination_desc:0 "The Capital Ship Attacks, the Escort Vessel chases. While this is a drastic oversimplification of naval combat, to an outsider this is what appears to be happening.

 NMZ_true_bluewater_harbor_desc:0 "The Echanger is fully functional and operating within all expected parameters.

 NMZ_pest_control_desc:0 "With the harbor heating up, steps must be taken to ensure the monsters of the wasteland are unable to pervert it.

With a nod the trio followed the armed merpony toward the center of the harbor. What they found was truly astonishing. A Battleship lying in a crater of sand and silt surrounded by dozens of seaponies.. It almost looked pristine. The Salvage crews are being prepared and the workers are readying their equipment. Work can start.. As soon as the Harbor-master regains consciousness."

 NMZ_prepare_salvage_crews_desc:0 "Hundreds of workers, ponies, gryphons, zebra, hippogryph, it doesn’t matter the race. Every hoof and claw that can lend it, is.

 NMZ_two_centuries_of_neglect_desc:0 "Despite the pristine look of the hull, the internal systems of this ship are a mess, fortunately this ship was old. Even by old world standards. Its likely it was Pre-war, in fact. While this doesn’t sound like much an improvement, the simplistic design of the venerable old warship means that replacement parts can be manufactured!

 NMZ_scouring_depths_desc:0 "With our divers training coming along smoothly we can begin sifting through the harbor floor, and the slowly clearing waters beyond.

 NMZ_breaking_down_wrecks_desc:0 "With the water drained our engineers have found themselves gobsmacked. While the warships are a total loss, the larger vessel appears nearly untouched by the corrosion normally seen on the exterior of most other craft. More pressing, the vessel appears to have been rigged to protect itself before she was sunk.

That fell to the Naval Marines who swarmed the craft after the Engineers fled. Despite being fully sealed, the ship's arcane reactor had been breached at some point. Likely during its sinking, with no power and leaking radiation, the ship's crew were ghoulified. Trapped below the waves without the ship's pumps to lift it to the surface."

 NMZ_emissary_idea_desc:0 "Few have ever seen an Alicorn with their own eyes, but the story of these winged nightmares prowling the wastes in search of ponies to snatch away is one many wastelanders have heard in recent years.
